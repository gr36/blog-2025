Be it dopamine hits or downright grifts.</p>\n<p>Even though we’ve long suspected otherwise, Meta <a href=\"https://investor.fb.com/resources/default.aspx\">still claim</a> that their mission is to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together” but now they are stating loud and clear they are only interested in users attention.</p>\n<p>If they truly wanted to connect people, they would build a social platform that encourages sharing. That promotes posts from the people you follow into your timeline and fosters communication. Meta would be focused on ensuring the things you post get to the people you want them to and foster a safe space for users to flourish. Instead, it does the opposite.</p>\n<p>They promote garbage and harmful content to all users. Hiding posts from the people you choose to follow in exchange for those from ‘creators’ made to farm attention. Building algorithms that showcase the worst the platform has to offer in the desperate attempt to show more ads next to them.</p>\n<p>Sure, Meta&rsquo;s chief product officer claims that “AI-generated art in certain verticals is really compelling” but the reality is found in their words. They stated that generative AI ads have an 11 percent higher click-through rate and 7.6 percent higher conversion rate — and this dear reader is the reason the company can never be trusted to do right by its users.</p>\n<p>As Marks shirt from Connect proudly claimed it’s <em>Zuck or nothing</em>. He can try to hide the reality in ancient Latin, or meaningless company statements about connecting people. The reality is they only care about advertising revenue, and it has always been about the company before anything else.</p>\n",

This blog is a hobby. I write on it because I find it enjoyable and the primary user is myself. And since it’s a hobby, money is not taken into consideration because I’m expected to pay for my hobbies.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Agree with this completely, I don’t expect to get anything back from writing, and I do it for myself much more than I do it for other people. Sure, I love people reading and responding to the things I publish, but it&rsquo;s my hobby, so I’m not focused on it. Like running or cycling is to some people, they may progress into races and competitions, it’s still something you enjoy doing for free.</p>\n<p>Where most people start to worry is when it creeps towards the territory of marking money. They start to worry about losing that money, and the pressure of publishing starts to build. Been there, done that, and it almost ruined my hobby.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A side project is a bit different. The way I see it, the users of a side project don’t necessarily overlap with the creator. That’s for example the case of People and Blogs. P&amp;B is not a hobby but a side project. The goal is to make something not for myself, but for others.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I tend to pick up and put down side projects, most of which revolve around my blog. Due to not achieving what I set my goals to be, and this is often the difference between the two things for me.</p>\n<p>For instance, I view my podcast, YouTube, and the now folded newsletter very much as side projects. They didn’t achieve the traction I wanted, so I have no problem stopping doing them (although my podcast will return soon).</p>\n",

        "content_html": "<p>Zach Seward being clear that <a href=\"#\">AI is not like you and me</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Aristotle, who had a few things to say about human nature, once declared, &ldquo;The greatest thing by far is to have a command of metaphor,&rdquo; but academics studying the personification of tech have long observed that metaphor can just as easily command us. Metaphors shape how we think about a new technology, how we feel about it, what we expect of it, and ultimately, how we use it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I highlighted a lot of this article to save for leather musing, but it got me thinking about things immediately. I’d recommend reading the entire post if you are even remotely interested in AI as it&rsquo;s pretty eye-opening, well written and diligently researched.</p>\n<p>The decisions made by the creators of technology and particularly AI dictate a lot of the things we think about it. What’s more is most people will not even be aware of the effects of portraying your product as if it were a person. The fact is, we give AI much more slack than we would with other things because it is portrayed with a friendly, eager to help tone and that’s by design.</p>\n<p>LLMS don’t just spurt back walls of text, they portray the answers in conversational styles, leading to increased levels of trust. Because you can’t be mad at something that apologises for being wrong so provocatively. Spurring in us a forgiving nature as if they were our friend. Artificial Intelligence doesn’t get things spectacularly wrong after all, they simply &ldquo;hallucinate&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>As Zack puts it brilliantly, “AI isn&rsquo;t doing shit. It is not thinking, let alone plotting. It has no aspirations. It isn&rsquo;t even an it so much as a wide-ranging set of methods for pattern recognition”. Imagine if you looked up a topic in an encyclopaedia, only for it to be entirely wrong and reference things that don’t exist, you wouldn’t tolerate it. Yet Search GPT is already <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/07/searchgpt-openai-error/679248/\">getting things wrong</a>, and that’s OK because it is portrayed as being just like us. Well, it&rsquo;s not.</p>\n",

None of that is particularly new, as the Meta founder has been feuding with Apple for years. But then Zuckerberg, who is usually quite controlled in his public appearances, revealed just how frustrated he is, telling Huang that his reaction to being told “no” is “fuck that.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’m conflicted when Zuckerberg says anything that I agree with. On the one hand, it is great news for the web. Zuckerberg hates closed platforms and is working to open up Threads to the open web, yet I can’t shake the thought that most of this is simple theatre.</p>\n<p>Of course, Zuck hates Apple&rsquo;s closed system…because he wants access to all the date from users. It’s not his good nature that leads him to open up Threads, it is the fact that it helps with all the things that Facebook is criticised for. He can simply point to the fact that users are free to move, and then continue to do what he wants on ‘his’ platform.</p>\n<p>But there’s this little part of me that wants to believe. That after years of “oh we didn’t mean to do that” when they break things, Meta is becoming a good-natured company.</p>\n",

        "content_html": "<p>John Gruber joining <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/07/att_data_breach_rcs_ios\">two unconnected things together</a> and predictably developing from it a pro apple stance (via <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/im-glad-iphones-are-getting-rcs/\">Birchtree</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the argument against RCS is strong and simple: it doesn’t support end-to-end encryption. The only new messaging platforms that should gain any traction are those that not only support E2EE, but that require it. Messaging and audio/video calls should only work through E2EE. That’s true for iMessage and FaceTime.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I try not to read, nor comment on, Daring Fireball things any more because the take from them is so clouded in pro-Apple rhetoric that it’s often difficult to see the wood for the trees. However, after Matts post about the article, I decided to read it for myself and boy what a weird take.</p>\n<p>RCS is merely a step forward for SMS and MMS, it never promised encryption, and I have my doubts that any carrier would support it even if it did. Apple presently sticks to routing RCS through carrier defaults. Google offers encryption over RCS by <a href=\"https://support.google.com/messages/answer/10252671?hl=en-GB#:~:text=When%20you%20message%20someone%20who,you%20and%20the%20other%20person.\">turning them into Google Messages,</a> meaning “your chat conversations automatically upgrade to end-to-end encryption”. I am sure that Apple could offer something similar, but considering their RCS implementation is essentially an FU to the EU, they chose not to.</p>\n<p>However, we are going off-topic a little. Whilst I agree with John’s opinion that any new implementation of messaging should be e2e encrypted, he completely skirts around the fact that Apple could offer this because it doesn’t fit into his narrative. Instead, he suggests sending all of your messaging through a third-party close system — mentioning WhatsApp specifically. Taking such a positive stance on privacy and then suggesting the use of Meta products is more than a little strange.</p>\n",

Many people have begun to think about these things now that the USA is finally preparing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/07/congress-privacy-deal-cantwell-rodgers/\">legislation on privacy and personal data</a>. Of course, that isn&rsquo;t a worry for me, but this short statement prodded at something I was thinking about when moving my blog around in the last few weeks.</p>\n<p>I really want to have an 11ty blog and keep all of my data to myself.

In exchange for being able to post easily and not have to deal with rebuild times and server things - my host calls the shots now. This will range from pretty much unlimited ability on platforms like WordPress to locked-down services like Hey World.

You don&rsquo;t do that by locking your card to your own wallet, you do it by making it an easy choice for consumers to pick you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Of course, Matt is correct. If anyone knows about payment matters, it&rsquo;s Matt. However, I think this is only part of the story. My Apple Wallet contains more than payment cards, and I foresee this becoming an issue when (rather than if) the EU forces Apple to open things up.</p>\n<p>Currently, my Apple Wallet holds a variety of items that I can access with a tap: a few loyalty cards, my Arsenal Football tickets (they are by far the greatest team the world has ever seen), and also train tickets for my upcoming trip to London. There&rsquo;s no hassle with different apps, printing things out, or searching through emails to find what I need; it&rsquo;s all there, ready for me. This utility, I envision, will be decimated the moment everyone can produce a &lsquo;wallet&rsquo; for my iPhone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c272249f05.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Suddenly, I&rsquo;ll need an LNER wallet to access my train tickets, a separate app for all my loyalty cards, and my Arsenal tickets will return to the app from which they came. The simple reason is that everyone wants you in their app. As Matt pointed out in his post, their &lsquo;wallet&rsquo; becomes a &lsquo;halo&rsquo; product. Not one that directly generates income, although it could, but one that markets to you every time you open the app to retrieve your tickets or cards. We know this because you only have to look at Android as an example.</p>\n<p>Every time I want to test a new Samsung phone, I endure the same frustrating experience. My bank, Barclays, doesn&rsquo;t support Samsung Pay. They were one of the last to add Apple Pay, and for a long time didn&rsquo;t support anything else. They tried instead to push their own payment app on Android users with a terrible experience. The great thing about Android is that I can download Google Pay and use that instead, but it doesn&rsquo;t work as seamlessly as the default app. Samsung also works very hard not to tell me I can use another payment app, and as a result, most users go without.</p>\n<p>This is because Samsung doesn&rsquo;t want to inform users they can switch. They want to be able to sell you things in the wallet app: a new phone, perhaps a card that will work with Samsung Pay, or some accessories. By getting users into your app, you can generate revenue, and that&rsquo;s important to all parties involved in the process. I think it&rsquo;s true that most retailers won&rsquo;t care, but many service providers will; they will want to cut out the 0.15% that Apple receives, and also sell you all their other wares while they&rsquo;re at it.</p>\n",

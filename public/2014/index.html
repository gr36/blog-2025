<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Right from the outset it’s obvious that this is a <em><em>Black Mirror</em></em> Christmas special filled with roast turkey, tinsel and snow aplenty. Also obvious from the very first scene is that the opening frames are building to a very different kind of Christmas special. Taking a delve into the not too distant, but very real technology influenced, dark and decrepit modern society.</p><p>Smile, it’s Christmas! The time for drinks, family time and peace on Earth to all men. Well maybe not all men, as the two main protagonists (played by Jon Hamm and and Rafe Spall) are clearly escaping or sentenced to escape away from the life they once had. From here, Charlie Brooker takes his usual stab at everything from Google Glass, to social media and even modern slavery and torture.</p><p>I told you this was dark, but all wrapped up in the way Brooker seems to cloud everything – just enough so the story seems to work on more than one level. The feature length special wraps three stories around each other, beginning at funny, and carrying right through to downright freaky. The story telling, writing and cinematography makes no changes from the two other short series we have seen before. If you haven’t already, then go a watch now as from here on in there be spoilers!</p><h2 id="romance-coaching"><strong>Romance Coaching</strong></h2><p>With wit, humor, and just a few white lies, Matt (Jon Hamm) begins to tell the story of of how he ended up in the place he is now. It’s narrated with all the silky smooth demeanor that his stereotypical American appearance conveys. Using his skills to coach what he describes as ‘dorks’, in this case Harry (Rasmus Hardiker), all while observing through “Eye­Link” all in the name of sex.</p><p>Providing jokes, motivation and a little stage fright in order to end the night in bed, they believe they have ‘hit the jackpot’ but the winning lady in this case, mistakes Harry talking to Matt as mental illness. When Harry aims to motivate her to do what the voices tell her by changing jobs she mistakes this for a suicide pact. So instead of spending the night between the sheets, they spend it dying on top of it, all whilst being observed by his ‘coach’ and anyone that has brought the footage. None are unwilling to get involved when the worst happens, raising questions to our current wearable technology, mental health issues and willingness to walk away rather than help someone in need.</p><p>When Matt’s wife is understandably unhappy when she discovers his involvement, we first see the best piece of social media critique ever as she blocks him.</p><h2 id="blocked-out"><strong>Blocked Out</strong></h2><p>Booker has taken the simple block option on social media and pushes this to what could be a logical extension. The person blocked simply becomes a greyed out vistal entity. The block solves nothing, conversation cannot conclude and nothing is resolved, yet the world moves on. Moving on is inevitable, as Matt’s day job raises all sorts of questions on what constitutes a human.</p><p>Matt’s day job is automating the homes of those rich enough to pay for the service, in this case Greta (Oona Chaplin), by implanting a small chip (cookie) into a persons brain to absorb ‘themselves’. They then record everything that makes up their personality and everything they like into lines of code, making smart and snide remarks to almost tease the ‘copy’ of a person. Once removed, this ‘person’ is put to work in automating everything in the house.</p><h2 id="forced-emotion-and-rushed-story"><strong>Forced Emotion and Rushed Story</strong></h2><p>Empathy for those imprisoned in the cookie is built fast with very real human reactions eradicated in a short period of time. The general tone and reactions from the story felt very forced and rushed. A human is not just their physical self, that goes without saying, but questions to Matt about the barbarity of his actions are forced aside quickly as if rushed. When Matt describes his technique of breaking ‘them’ in without snapping completely it felt as though this story could have should have been covered in an hour long episode alone. Just by using the word ’empathetic,’ Matt both insults and compliments.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/529221a3fb.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" /></figure><p>That’s all before we even move onto poor Joe (Rafe Spall) and his tale of woe. Casting bright colours against a plain white dusting of snow, Joes story starts with actions and sounds of love and joy. With an appearance from the same song when everything goes wrong in the second episode of <em><em>Black Mirror – </em></em>an offbeat rendition of Irma Thomas’ “Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand).”</p><h2 id="old-faces-and-ideas"><strong>Old Faces And Ideas</strong></h2><p>This throw back also marks the point where everything will seem very familiar if you have watched previous episodes. After Joe is blocked by his pregnant girlfriend, it descends into a mixtures of old episodes and characters. You see images of dancers on Hot Shots and even the comedy show that spawned Waldo.</p><p>After spending years being blocked and not being able to see his daughter, it is eventually rescinded when she dies in a rail crash, so Joe is finally able to set eyes on his daughter for the first time. From here on out its twists and turns that are not to be missed so I won’t spoil them here. The one-off episode is available on 4OD and also should be available on DirectTV in the US from the 21st onward. Merry Christmas!</p>

     <p>To be social – “needing companionship and therefore best suited to living in communities or an informal social gathering, especially one organized by the members of a particular club or group”. In the modern age this no longer needs to be done in person, it can all be done without leaving your house. Facebook messenger, Google Hangouts and Skype mean you can interact with people much easier all over the world.</p><p>According to Ofcom, the use of social networks in several countries has actually felt a decline in 2014. Measuring web traffic to social networks compared to other websites, the UK regulator found some unsuspected results. Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are seeing less weekly visits from users in major countries around the world.</p><h2 id="social-visits"><strong>Social Visits</strong></h2><p>The largest decline in weekly access to social networks coming from users in the UK – dropping from 65% to 56%. Declining use also in the US (from 56% to 54%), Japan (45% to 42%), and China (62% to 57%). Many countries also had increased number of visits, however, such as France, Italy, Australia and Spain.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/8254be2649.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="848" height="416" /></figure><p>These figure will have no cause for alarm for those running these social networks, as many have actually recorded increased usage and interaction over the last year. With 1.35 billion monthly active users on Facebook (Facebook 28/10/14), and 284 million active users on<a href="https://about.twitter.com/company"> Twitter sending 500million tweets </a>every day!</p><p>Increased usage of less “traditional social networks” has been highlighted as a catalyst to these figures. Users are still visiting social sites in the billions, but increase usage of online videos and messaging services are “cannibalizing social network usage” according to Ofcom. Users don’t need to visit a website to interact with their friends any longer, WhatsApp and other messaging services offer quicker and easier solutions.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/8c79928f56.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="847" height="452" /></figure><h2 id="mobile-rules-them-all"><strong>Mobile Rules Them All</strong></h2><p>There is one winner from all of the Ofcom reports and figures, and that’s mobile usage. Social networking is the largest online use of your pocket computer. We have reported <a href="http://techaeris.com/2014/09/06/shopping-online-mobile-leads-way/">the rise of mobile browsing at several points</a> this year. Even the rise of online shopping is nowhere near as popular as those social apps, tipping other activities such as reading the news, shopping and playing games in all but China and Japan.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Round is cool. That’s just a fact – wheels, money, Oreos… they’re all brilliant. We’ve only seen two attempts at round Android Wear watches, and just one if you count the flat tyre of the Moto 360. Why there isn’t more, only manufacturers know. Most have adopted the safe haven of a square. So here we are, left with the <a href="http://amzn.to/1GmJPB6">LG G Watch R</a>.</p>
<p>You can stop thinking that this is a round version of the original LG G watch right now. Thats a very wrong assumption to make, as much like the <a href="http://techaeris.com/2014/12/04/sony-smartwatch-3-review-the-best-android-wear-watch-at-the-moment/">Sony Smartwatch 3 I tested last week</a>, it has received spec bumps and improvements in all the areas that you need. The <a href="http://amzn.to/1GmJPB6">G Watch R</a> (GWR) is competing with the specs of the Sony watch, in what many consider hardware version 2 on Android Wear.</p>
<p>Unlike the original G Watch, design has been very much on the minds of LG when working on the GWR. Instead of the plain Nexus like design, we get something that looks a top of the range sports watch, all be it a sports watch from the 1990’s, and those design cues are straight from G shock.</p>
<h2 id="design-choices"><strong><strong><strong>Design Choices</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<p>Its almost annoying that the numbered dial around the outside doesn’t turn, so I can relive some youthful games of marking how much oxygen I had left. This does mean that, along with the Moto 360, it can actually be mistaken for a normal watch – something distinctly lacking from LG’s first model. Being more at home with a suit in the office with the Moto 360, than out running with the Sony Smartwatch 3.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e3a6043354.jpg" alt="" width="819" height="410" /></figure>
<p>The large bezel around the outside replaces the flat tyre look of the Motor 60, its actually a full circle! This does add a little bulk, and slightly inhibits you a bit when swiping cards away. Being a large margin above the 1.3-inch P-OLED display, the design makes the usual palm over the device a little more difficult. The display is noticeably smaller than the Sony Smartwatch 4, maintaining 320×320 dimensions, but colors are much more vibrant.</p>
<h2 id="strap-life"><strong><strong><strong>Strap Life</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<p>Coming with a leather strap its hard to know where LG want to sit the styling of the watch. You would expect a watch taking all its design cues from sports watches to come with a high grade rubber strap like most of the competition. However the bundled leather strap is a confusing mix of sports and fashion, and with the leather wearing within a few days around the fastening and strap end its clearly not high grade leather.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9209c87239.jpg" alt="" width="819" height="410" /></figure>
<p>That’s not all bad news as this leather wearing in does mean that after a few days use the strap is amazingly comfortable. Luckily the watch uses a standard 22mm watch strap so changing them for something new is easy. The only question that should be asked though is why should you have to? With the low grade leather its hard to see how they can justify the £220 price tag, given the Moto 360 come in at £199. It will be a tough choice to justify the extra outlay when comparing them side by side.</p>
<h2 id="harder-to-kill"><strong><strong><strong>Harder to Kill</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<p>Given the choice on paper, many will chose the Moto 360. During use, the battery life increase on the GWR alone is worth a little extra outlay. The 410 mah battery consistently gets me through 2 days with moderate use – even the odd day of heavy use still saw me through to the next morning.</p>
<p>Battery life on Android wear is a tough choice, the battery life needs to last through a tough day of heavy use, but does it really need to last more than that? We are a long way off anything last as long as the pebble, but I am fast coming to the conclusion that if the battery lasts more than a day, then it needs to last two – otherwise manufactures are just adding weight to spec sheets, for no real reason to the end user.</p>
<h2 id="harder-to-like"><strong><strong><strong>Harder to like</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<p>There are certain products that just don’t have that special something, and that last little bit is missing from the G Watch. It doesnt feel like a step forward, despite the improved display and battery, it just feels like a round version on the first generation hardware – all be it with much better looks and a much better battery.</p>
<p>The battery charger, although easy to use, is a proprietary piece of hardware I have to worry about. So anytime I spend traveling I have to make sure I know where this small bit of plastic is. Though I am sure this won’t suffer the same fate as my Gear Live charger, more manufacturers need to offer at least a back up of the basic micro USB connection.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2f2434d94f.jpg" alt="" width="819" height="410" /></figure>
<p>It does however feature a heartrate sensor, that seems to be much more accurate than others on the market. Unlike the Gear Live I can use it after a run and whilst damp. Despite the graphing ability in Google Fit, we are still lacking the ability to record it at intervals through out the day.</p>
<p>The lack of an ambient light sensor was also a big draw back after using the SW3 and Moto 360 as it means the screen is either on or off, which is constantly annoying. Luckily the 5.0 update to Android Wear has fixed this little issue (but more about that another time). The recent update however, has yet to fix all the small announces with the screen.</p>
<p>When the screen dims after covering of after a period of inactivity, the screen fades all the way to black, only to brighten back up to the dim screen. If the screen then turns on the face will jump slightly, very noticeable due to the high contrast colour on the screen. Again a small annoyance, but ruining the experience of the most expensive Android watch on the market ever so slightly.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong><strong><strong>Conclusion</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<p>If styling is the most important factor to you and you want a full circle Android Wear smartwatch, there is only one watch to choose from. For a good looking Android Wear watch without the battery anxiety of the Moto 360, choose the G Watch R. But for all the round ability on the G Watch R, it falls short of living up to Android Wear hardware v2. Given the expensive outlay be sure the styling is for you, as it will soon be outdated with new hardware incoming.</p>

     <p>It feels much longer, but it’s been less than 6 months since Android Wear hit the market. They have stealthily crept into use without much fuss, despite revolutionising the wearables market. Reducing the time spent interacting with your phone, but still mining all of that lovely data for Google. The launch devices were pretty average, the Moto 360 wasn’t for everyone despite its anticipation. So now its time to see, perhaps one of the more experienced smart watch maker, Sony take on Android wear. The Sony Smartwatch 3 review is straight ahead.</p>
<p>Despite claiming they had no intention of making a watch for Android Wear, they have followed up two generations of Sony Smartwatch running their own OS, with a third – this time running Android Wear. The imaginatively titled ‘Sony Smartwatch 3’ has the same rugged lifestyle proof ratings that their phones do. Each Android watch has been water resistant, but the SM3 sports an IP68 rating mean you can submerge it in water for up to 30 minutes, should you feel the need.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5ec5954780.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" /></figure>
<p>The IP68 rating means you can leave the watch on when going about your daily life and it will stand up to everything – swimming, running, working and even the occasional bump and scrape can all be shrugged off, although you will still suffer the phantom touches from water that have plagued every model so far.</p>
<h2 id="design-for-many"><strong>Design For Many</strong></h2>
<p>With its basic, no nonsense name echoed in its design (that in many ways takes on Google’s Nexus design language), it isn’t going to win any design awards – but what some people may call boring and plain others will call understated and sleek. In certain light conditions on the black model, it’s sometimes impossible to tell where the screen ends and the band starts.</p>
<p>Choose any colour band you like, but they all are made of the same high quality rubber, with a matte finish. Matched with a clasp similar to that of a normal fashion watch, you have the making of foolproof comfy fitting. Unfortunately this is the sole area that lets the Smartwatch 3 down, and does it quite badly.</p>
<p>For want of better words, the fit is not going to be for everyone. The clasp is very big and a little loose matching this to there being too much space between notches, the fit can occupy that annoying space between one setting being too tight and the next too loose. Combine this with the flat ‘core’, it fits much like the LG G Watch rather than the much comfier Gear Live.</p>
<p>Of course everyone’s wrists are going to be different, so a try before you buy is recommended as the fitting may not be for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="lifestyle-proof"><strong><strong><strong>Lifestyle Proof</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<p>Dust resistance may be a box that doesn’t need to be ticked, but anything to life proof it can only help. What that does mean is that everything is sealed into the watch, but its not actually a watch per se. The main body pops out to reveal what Sony call ‘the core’. This can then be swapped into other bands, and presumably other things, but until now there is just a white, yellow or a pink rubber band to choose from.</p>
<p>If they could match this to a metal and/or a leather option, you would have a look for every occasion. However, achieving this Android Wear for work and play may be down to Google improving the speed in switching wearables, with manufacturers eventually releasing easily changeable watch bands to rival the yet unreleased Apple Watch.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/eb46ed0e77.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" /></figure>
<p>This core charges using a standard mini USB cable, so ditches the docks and proprietary chargers that others have needed. Which makes a very welcome change, as some of these have caused issues. The IP rating means, much like the Sony phones, is covered up with a rubber flap. Which the longevity of which remains to be seen, but gaining access to the connection is easy to achieve, much more than messing around with a required dock or connector.</p>
<h2 id="improved-ability"><strong><strong><strong>Improved Ability</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<p>The comparison to other Android watches unfortunately has to carry on, as with the Sony watch we could be at the start of v2 of the hardware. No bold and revolutionary changes are seen with the Smartwatch 3, but how many improvements can be made to a watch? Everything sees a much needed improvement to the areas that really matter.</p>
<p>The screen is the same 1.6 inches we have seen before, with a new ‘Transflective Display’ providing the 320×320 display.  This fancy technology means that while the screen isn’t as vibrant and colourful as that seen on the Moto 360, you can see it clear and accurately in even the brightest of sunlight. A fantastic improvement to what was the biggest gripe of the first wave of Android Wear watches.</p>
<h2 id="spec-bumps"><strong><strong><strong>Spec Bumps</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<p>The battery receives a small bump to 420mah, which hardly seems a huge deal given the LG watch had 400mah when it hit the shelves. With improvements to the screen and internals, the claimed 2 days of battery life is easily achievable. Where a day of use had me needing the charger at 7pm with the Moto 360, i’m easily able to resist the charging cable for more than 48 hours with the Smartwatch 3.</p>
<p>This is the first Android smartwatch based on the Broadcom SoC platform, packing a 1.2GHz Quad-core ARM Cortex A7 processor and its own on board GPS Sensor allowing for phone free tracking if needed. Along with off live music playback through Bluetooth headphones – thanks to the updated Android Wear OS, you could run phone free if you needed.</p>
<p>The watch also has built in wifi, all be it lying dormant while the Android Wear support lacks support. A future update may mean phone free updating too, should Google wish to take Android wear down that street. Android Wear on the SM3 is in stark contrast to that seen on the Gear Live. Rather than duplicating or replacing every wear app, the SM3 is completely stock, save for a few watch faces that are actually very well designed. Usefulness and ability is the same as any other Android Wear watch currently on the market… if you have used one you have used them all.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9558d7f828.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" /></figure>
<p>All being said this is by and far the best Android Wear watch on the market at the moment. There are improvements to be made in comfort, but the ability and usability from the thought Sony has put in more than makes up for it. It would be hard to choose this over the Moto 360 or even the G Watch R for styling, but the all round ability of Sony’s Smartwatch 3 is second to none.</p>

     <p>It almost comes as no surprise when new levels of spying are uncovered in the ‘post Snowden era.’ Government agencies are one thing, but surprise is the least valid emotion when information gives light to the involvement of big business. The information we have now may only be showing the tip of the iceberg, however Cable and Wireless involvements seems to be the level of sinking the Titanic on its own.</p><p>In a Joint investigation with German broadcaster WDR, <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/spy-cable-revealed-how-telecoms-firm-worked-with-gchq">Channel 4 News released information directly from Snowden</a> on the level of GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) spying on not just the UK but the world. A level at which Snowden was outspoken over, describing as “the most intrusive.” Unable to deal with the level of information now flowing under the beaches of Cornwall, they had huge help from the very people responsible for the cable. In an operation they called ‘Mastering the internet’ GCHQ was provided information directly by Cable and Wireless.</p><h2 id="power-to-you"><strong><strong><strong>Power To You</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>Cable and Wireless have been responsible for thousands of miles of cable leaving the beaches of Cornwall for over a century. It would appear that they have been providing a backdoor to GCHQ into the communications for several years. Is it purely coincidence that since 2012 the firm is now in the hands of UK based Vodafone, a company that has previously been highlighted by Snowden as tapping the phones of millions of people worldwide.</p><p>In documents seen by Channel 4, in a period between 2008 and 2013, the company went by the code name ‘Gerontic.’ GCHQ had direct access to Cable and Wireless cables entering the UK in Cornwall, code named Nigella, intercepting the private communications of millions of users from all over the UK. GCHQ certainly planned, if not succeeded, to intercept trillions of gigabytes of data per second.</p><p>So cozy was the partnership they had a full time GCHQ working inside the company, and carried out testing on the behalf of GCHQ on equipment. Holding regular meetings between 2008 and 2010, and receiving millions of pounds in payment for its troubles. They also provided feedback and suggestion of the best way to gain information. Even useful hints and tips about how GCHQ ‘could’ tap into its network if required.</p><h2 id="worldwide-wire-tap"><strong><strong><strong>Worldwide Wire Tap</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>Safe in the knowledge that its own customers could be spied upon at any time, Genotic also went after other providers’ information by tapping into the cables of partner communications firms supplying the rest of the world. Renting space from India based Reliance Communications that has cables running from Asia, through the Middle East and landed in Sennen Cove. A mere few miles down the coast form its own landing in Porthcurno in Cornwall. Close still to GCHQ’s base in Bude.</p><p><strong><strong>“It is longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters; Furthermore, all of GCHQ’s work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensures that our activities are authorized, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight.”  – GCHQ spokesman</strong></strong></p><p>As they have done with all previous accusations both GCHQ and Vodafone have denied all involvement other than those that it is legally obliged to upkeep. Insisting direct access to its network was impossible without Vodafone knowledge and a warrant to do so. Adding “there are processes for us to do that which we’re not allowed to talk about because the law constrains us from revealing these things. We don’t go beyond what the law requires”</p><h2 id="gerontic-lives"><strong><strong><strong>Gerontic Lives</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>This is all despite the fact that documents exist detailing the involvement, still being referred to as Gerontic, as late as April 2013: long after the takeover by Vodafone. So denials of involvement are either plausibly denied, or simply incorrect. What is sure is that these accusations of involvement are already affecting large business and government contracts.</p><p>None more so in Germany, where it has 30 million customers, that it will struggle to keep. Although they vehemently deny the accusations Vodafone have been linked with heavy involvement with spying on German government officials, including the Prime Minster Angela Merkel. Despite using encrypted devices and communications, many experts have called for cancelation of all contracts with Vodafone.</p><p>Many providers have now moved communications away from the beaches of Cornwall, but the reduction of interception is unknown. The level of ‘partnerships’ that were built by GCHQ is still yet to be known, and many still exist to this day. A practice that recoups millions in payments each month maybe hard for business to turn down.</p><p>GCHQ and the FBI have been publicly outspoken about the use of encryption and the security of populations. Giving outlandish accusations that people will die because of its use. Using encrypted devices and communications maybe of little use if the company providing them is also providing a backdoor to agencies. Many companies swear to be fighting the good fight, and looking after their customers but how many actually are. Maybe we will never know for sure.</p>

     <p>The Verge have been accused of many things, read some comments on posts and they switch between users yelling ‘iVerge’ to saying they are ‘Android biased’. Vlad Savov even wrote a whole article on why his reviews <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/24/6834955/vlad-reviews">are better because of bias</a>. He raises some good points, but it also raises a much larger issue with the world of technology reviews: is objective reviewing even possible anymore?</p><p>This became all the more obvious whilst using a Lumia recently to see how Windows Phone had grown from 8 to 8.1. The ultimate goal of each operating system or manufacturer is to keep you buying their products, even before you need to if at all possible. So instead of taking the risk of going elsewhere, companies have come up with all sorts of plans to ‘lock you in’ and ensure your continued custom and revenue.</p><p>First starting with differing operating systems and usage, this quickly expanded to creating brand application stores, accessories, and general feeling of belonging to a team. You choose your side and stick with it through thick and thin, band times and good.</p><h2 id="those-damn-hipsters"><strong><strong><strong>Those Damn Hipsters</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>Each brand, operating system or manufacturer has its image. You could argue that this started long before the smartphone, back in the PC vs Mac days, or Windows and Linux, when the ethos was “choose a side!”. So called fanboys sprouted from everywhere online, communities were built and people belonged. This is a story that can take an age to tell, but what’s established is the ethos and brand users felt.</p><p>But much more than this, Apple created a brand image that has become synonymous with the people that buy the products. Once the rebel underdog fighting against the evil Microsoft, the brand has evolved into the artists brand, and in the smart phone age it that has taken on a luxury image. Founding Apple Hippies, now morphed into cash rich middle class Hipsters.</p><p>Users felt exclusive, entitled and most of all proud of the executive phone they carried. All the while with each iTunes and App Store purchase were less and less likely to even consider a competitive handset. While we’re at it, you know that iTunes runs much better on a Mac, don’t you? It is also much better for all your artistic needs, because that’s why you are an Apple user right?</p><h2 id="capital-captivity"><strong><strong><strong>Capital Captivity</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>Let’s not forget all those nice accessories you have for your phone won’t work with anything else, so don’t even think about that new Android flagship. As the once underdog became the top dog a new starter in the field would take over this image, one lead by an equally geeky culture; Android. Producing with it a huge number of companions to your new device.</p><p>With matching tablet, Chromecast streaming device plugged into all your TVs and the options of having it on your wrist and in your car, to just consider switching to another OS leaves you without these devices, so the desire to leave has to either be financially viable or massively motivating.</p><p>Slipping your sim into a Windows Phone handset immediately leaves a user without some Google services that they may have spent years with. Yes, Gmail is just about workable but not on the same level, but no Google Plus, no Chromecast along with extremely limited YouTube and don’t even think about a wearable. Whichever side you choose can you bare to spend time switching services and be subjective to a new platform?</p><h2 id="muscle-memory"><strong><strong><strong>Muscle Memory</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>This is without taking into account the learnt abilities and work abilities of the usual platform of choice. Although Apple seems determined to pull in features from Android, the three major platforms are uniformly and intently different from each other. Because one ability is easy and learnt on one, does not mean it is on another.</p><p>Buttons move, menus change and strengths and weaknesses of a platform differ. This is all the more prevalent between the two large platforms of iOS and Android, compared to Windows Phone, but it is also creeping in between OEM Android handsets. Each mobile company is building their own features that are not available on any other phones. Unlike iOS, on Android and to a point Windows Phone you are not just comparing specs and platforms, but also who makes it.</p><p>There is definitely a movement within Android users that brands attract loyalty. On Google Plus and Twitter it’s obvious that Samsung attracts different users compared to HTC,  as does Motorola and the holier than thou Nexus users. They each have a completely different ethos in both hardware and software.</p><h2 id="what-phone-should-i-get"><strong><strong><strong>What Phone Should I Get?</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>Phones are like cars, some have strengths and weaknesses but they can each do a job. Decide what job you need it to do and get the one that ticks the most boxes. Be happy and proud you chose the right phone for you and made up your own mind. For some help read and watch as many reviews as possible.</p><p>There are a wealth of really good reviewers out there, some have come and gone, some have started out great but have given into the lure of big bucks from manufacturers. Regardless, can any of them be subjective? Can an iPhone user give a Windows Phone a good run, or give in like me after a day as it’s not the same as their previous phone?</p><p>Even within Android, can a Motorola user give the new Samsung an honest review? Or even a current Samsung user for that matter? Take everything in with pinch of salt, consider the angle the review has and read a few. At the end of the day though, it’s something you have to decide on your own!</p>

     <p>You’ve read the few stories floating around, you’ve seen <a href="http://techaeris.com/2014/09/24/iphone-6-bendgate-control-heres-internets-best-responses/">our round up of ‘#Bendgate’</a>, and you’ve even watched some fools bend iPhones on YouTube only to dismiss the issue just like I did. It wasn’t until I discovered my own iPhone was bent that I started to believe those YouTube bending fools. It’s not as bent as some iPhone 6 Pluses I have seen mind you, but when placed face down it certainly doesn’t sit flat.</p><p>From day two I’ve had the phone sitting in its nice official leather case living out its quiet life in my hand, in my pocket, or on my desk. So how exactly can my phone bend in its short quiet life? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p>I went into this this frustrating journey of replacing my bent iPhone filled with confidence that it would be a simple issue of getting the phone replaced after a few calls, but I couldn’t have been more wrong.</p><h2 id="%E2%80%98cpw-cares%E2%80%99"><strong><strong><strong>‘CPW Cares’</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>The number of phones in stock would be my first major hurdle. Considering Apple has sold so many iPhone 6s in the short time they’ve been out, they may be in short supply and make it harder to get an exchange. I figure calling the store I purchased the iPhone 6 from was my best bet to check and see if they have stock and explain my situation. Forty minutes later of being on hold and I’m beginning to think going to the store is best option. Not a huge deal, having worked there in the past, thinking this would be easy.</p><p>When I arrived, the store manager checked to see if I was ok after waiting less than five minutes, but unfortunately I still ended up leaving the store empty handed. He quickly informed me that I would have to go an Apple store, the nearest of which is three to four hours of driving away, even after I told him that I only had the phone for a little over a week.</p><p>“Out of our hands” he told me, “it’s not faulty so it’s your problem”. Strange thing for him to say when he hadn’t even set eyes on the handset. Below (and above) is a picture illustrating the ‘not faulty’ iPhone.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/cbc2136e8b.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="400" height="200" /></figure><p>I even went as far as pointing out the fact that under UK Law, 11N of The Supply of Goods and service act (1982) states that responsibility is placed firmly at the retailer’s door. This information didn’t even raise more than a grunt from the scruffy supercilious manager.</p><h2 id="please-hold-your-call-is-important-to-us"><strong><strong><strong>Please Hold, Your Call Is Important To Us</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>Right or not, I presumed that one store manager didn’t speak for the business, so thought it best to try a little higher up the chain. I called the Carphone Warehouse Customer care number who, despite the name, didn’t seem to care at all.</p><p>I was assured that “Apple has put the phone through rigorous testing and it requires a large amount of force…” but I tuned them out after that. The nice lady went off to see what my options were and informed me when she returned after ten minutes that I could take it back to the store and they will send it to Apple (which could take up to three weeks) or I could take it myself.</p><h2 id="applecare"><strong><strong><strong>AppleCare</strong></strong></strong></h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/af938d3a13.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Apple logo icon" loading="lazy" /></figure><p>I called my mobile network (o2) and they said they would be happy to exchange the handset but, since I bought it from CPW, there was nothing they could do. Resigned to the fact I am going to have to sort things out myself, I suppose fours hours out my day is not the worst thing in the world. I have since booked an appointment at the Apple Store in Sheffield on Tuesday, so hopefully that will be the end of my journey.</p><p>This whole experience has left me feeling like it’s me that has the issue, or that I’m crazy and just being too picky. I am most of all annoyed, not at the phone, but at at the service seeing as the issue should have been sorted after one hour and not several days. These are the considerations you must take into account when buying a phone from now on.</p>

     <p>It wasn’t even a concern for Apple when designing the initial iPhone, but mobile applications can make or break a handset – or even an entire OS. If current research is to be believed, the demand for downloading applications is decreasing – even as the smartphone market continues to explode.</p><p>New research carried out by Deloitte has shown that the average number of apps downloaded per user is declining. Not only that, but it’s down by a huge amount. The study shows that nearly a third of all smartphone users in the UK do not download any apps to their smartphones in a given month. For those who do download apps, the average number has declined from 2.32 to 1.82. As well, the study showed that only 1 in 9 users ever pay for an app for their phone.</p><h2 id="bloatware"><strong>Bloatware</strong></h2><p>Does this mean that the application market is imploding as the headlines would have you believe? Hardly.</p><p>The number of smartphone apps that come included with various operating systems and custom interfaces is continually increasing. Most Android handsets come complete with a whole suite of media consumption apps, not to mention social media apps such as Facebook and Twitter. Users vary rarely use the <a href="http://www.strategyanalytics.com/default.aspx?mod=pressreleaseviewer&amp;a0=5500">supplied apps by Samsung</a> and other manufacturers, so why would the basic users need to download anything else?</p><h2 id="ageing-users"><strong>Ageing Users</strong></h2><p>Even Deloitte themselves have attempted to shed a little light on the finding by breaking it down to age groups. An increasing number of smartphone users over the age of 50 has a decreased demand for applications, which means they are generally happy with those included, or may download a few when first setting up the handset. However they are less likely to download any additions later in the phones life.</p><blockquote>“The new adopters of smartphones use them mostly for text messaging. When you look at who uses IM (instant messaging) services like WhatsApp and WeChat, it tends to be younger age groups and it declines very steeply with age.” – Paul Lee, head of research for technology, media and telecommunications at Deloitte</blockquote><p>Even younger users, once they have downloaded an additional suite of apps when they are first setting up the handset, will use only a handful – and rarely, if ever add to them.</p>

     <p>Technology is advancing at such a rate that cutting edge equipment is surpassed in a few short months. Many things that were a luxury a few years ago are considered essential now. <a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/">Ofcom have conducted varied research</a> into communication technology understanding and communication needs with some unsurprising results.</p><p>The study found that telephony services, on both mobile and landline, as well as internet access are now essential to our daily lives. It’s reported that 61 percent of people value a voice communication service highly for keeping in touch with friends and family as well as instant access to emergency services.</p><h2 id="mobile-reliance"><strong>Mobile Reliance</strong></h2><p>This mostly related to mobile communication services, however, home telephone service was very much linked to age. 61% of people over 75 need access to a landline, while just 12% of 16-24 year olds reported the same. Additionally, 59 percent of all people considered mobile voice or text messaging services essential.</p><p>The usage rate of voice communication are dying with the so called millennium generation.  In the 14-15 age range only 5% of teenagers said they used voice communication over the phone or sent emails. In stark contrast to more than 50% of adults who use both.</p><p>However 57 percent of respondents valued internet access as a basic human essential in order to access information for education as well as entertainment. This again was very much dependent on age, 53% of 16-24 years olds valued it highly, and however no one over 75 rated it essential.</p><h2 id="costs-of-communication"><strong>Costs Of Communication</strong></h2><p>New technology has become part of our lives, and something we cannot live without.  This also comes with an extra cost. Having to factor in the monthly cost of home internet access and also a mobile phone contract can be a struggle to some people.</p><p>At the moment 95% of UK households have a home telephone line, with 82% also having an internet connection at home. However 86 percent of the consumer’s survey have never had a problem in meeting the costs and only 7 percent said they would have an internet connecting if the costs were more affordable.</p><h2 id="social-costs"><strong>Social Costs</strong></h2><p>The costs of being so reliant or engrossed in communication technology is not limited to monetary costs. Many lose or are restricted in health related activities or social interaction. Ofcom have uncovered that users in the UK spend more time using technology than sleeping.</p><p>The average user spent eight hours and 41 minutes using technology. This is defined as watching TV, listening to the radio, surfing the internet or using a mobile phone. In contrast they spent eight hours and 21 minutes asleep in bed.</p><p>Google’s Android Wear has been marketed at reducing the time you spend interacting with your devices. It attempts to just get information when you need it. Will this make a difference, or is interaction destined to be done through online services?</p>

     <p>It was Sony that first started the the conspiracy around killing your device when they wanted you to upgrade. The fabled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_timer">‘Sony timer’</a> stopped the tech from working days after the warranty expired, making you upgrade to newer hardware. Now the theorist have moved onto Apple.</p><p>The anecdotal <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/upshot/hold-the-phone-a-big-data-conundrum.html?_r=2">evidence has been that Apple intentionally</a> slows down the old version of the handset when launching a new version to force you to think about upgrading. This whole concept is called ‘planned obsolescence’ or the un-coincidental demise of a device.</p><p>It seems that some credence has been handed to the theory by a new Harvard study from economics student Laura Trucco. Trucco looked at the amount of people searching for phrases such as ‘iPhone Slow’ when a new version of the handset is launched.</p><p>What Trucco found is actually pretty substantial from such a simple study. Whenever a new iPhone is released, search phrases relating to slowing down of the older version skyrocket. What’s more, this is not coincidental and searches relating to Android handsets such as ‘Galaxy s3 slow’ did not increase in correlation to a new device launch. Simply increasing over time as more are sold.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/f8e315b067.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="702" height="336" /></figure><h2 id="expectation-led"><strong>Expectation Led</strong></h2><p>The implication is that Apple somehow slows down the device to make the user more likely to upgrade to a new handset when the slowdown may be just lead by expectation. If you watch the new device launch and they boast about how the new model is twice as fast, your current model is going to feel slow.</p><p>The slowdown is an unavoidable occurrence as Apple attempts to make the newer model software feature as much new ability as possible. As the new version of software is adopted by users of older handsets, they are less able to cope with the new features, and as such run much slower.</p><p>One thing Apple is great at is new software adoption after launch, while an Android handset may have several months before it is able to receive a version of the newest iteration of Android. After all Apple controls both hardware and software, enabling them to work much more quickly and have more control than Android manufactures.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/c5cb94754a.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="702" height="336" /></figure><h2 id="fragmentation"><strong>Fragmentation</strong></h2><p>An Android device may not receive an updated Android version for months after release if at all. Even then this release will not reach all users at once.  It will be slowed by differing manufactures, different version of the device and also network testing. So if the same issues do take place on Android handsets it would not show the spike that Apple handsets do.</p><p>However there are advantages to this model. If an Android handset was unable or not able to run a new feature well, this feature would be left out of the update or simply the handset would not be updated. Sure as each integration of iOS and Android is released it become more and more taxing on the internals of older devices.</p>

    <h1 class="p-name">OnePlus One: A Real World Review</h1>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Since moving across to use Android I have spent the whole time trying to find the perfect device. Many have come and satisfied me for a short while, but there is always a compromise somewhere. Whether it be poor battery life, poor camera, or poor software, the reasons are many. The next in this line is the marmite device, the OnePlus One.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, you can’t avoid talk of the OPO. If it’s not a vocal few voicing opinions on the marketing, it’s the many more begging for an invite to buy the phone. Even after ordering the phone it still divides people. My experience on a daily basis goes from “wow is that the OnePlus One? How did you get one!” to “what on earth is that phone” in equal amounts.</p>
<h2 id="unboxing-is-an-experience"><strong>Unboxing Is An Experience</strong></h2>
<p>Be prepared for the whole experience of the phone that start from the shipping box. Pulling the exposed tab reveals the best packaging I have ever experienced. Even the unboxing felt like a special event, reserved for those worthy enough to gain an invite to even buy the phone.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6c3653ab65.jpg" alt="" width="702" height="351" /></figure>
<p>So much was this experience <a href="http://techaeris.com/2014/07/20/oneplus-a-quick-one-day-hands-on/">I had to put together an initial hands on</a> with the phone as it felt so good unboxing and just feeling the phone. The build quality of the phone trumps any plastic put out by the majority of manufacturer. It falls short of the level of the HTC One M8, but these two ‘ones’ are top of the tree in build.</p>
<p>What OnePlus have done is spent the money on the device in some strange areas. Considering the key ring Sim-ejector tool, the amazing quality USB lead and the deluxe packaging. Then put these against the two adaptors I have to use just to plug it into the wall. Leaves a few questions of the importance placed on usually unimportant areas, but the areas that do matter do not disappoint.</p>
<h2 id="hands-on"><strong>Hands On</strong></h2>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1d14a331a4.jpg" alt="" width="702" height="351" /></figure>
<p>I said it in the initial hands on this phone is big in the hand. The square corners make it slightly uncomfortable to start with. That’s assuming you adopt the usual pinkie underneath grip that most people do. After a week of use the backing of the sandstone black handset has lost some of its gritty feel but none of the grip, now resembling a feel similar to rough felt. Making it feel great to the touch, strong and reassuringly sturdy.</p>
<p>Dominating the front of the phone is the 5.5 inch screen. I said this phone was big didn’t I? The Screen produces colours that are bright and vivid, if a little on the warm side. Not to mention the level of tweaking options available will make any user happy. Combining this with the sound from the twin speakers, everything from a full movie to a quick YouTube clip is engrossing. Even if the sound is blasted sideways and not forwards which you get from the Sony Z2 and HTC One M8.</p>
<h2 id="spec-sheet-war"><strong>Spec Sheet War</strong></h2>
<p>Is it possible to see any stutter from devices anymore? Modern powerhouses of processors make light of easy tasks. The OPO is no exception, the Snapdragon 801 doesn’t even break a sweat to keep usage fluid and response. With gaming and extensive tasks bringing out the best in the chip.</p>
<p>Even the most graphic and process intensive activity is a breeze. Combine this with 3GB of ram for all your multitasking pleasures. One advantage of such a large handset is space to fill with battery power. So even a day of heavy use will be no issue for the 3100mah battery. Getting in excess of 6 hours screen on. Of course your millage may vary.</p>
<p>The only let-down is the screen is not a responsive as I would like. Spending a good ten minutes working out if it was my imagination or just that anything after the latency on the M8 feels like a step backwards. Leaving the on screen navigation keys sometimes a little under responsive.</p>
<h2 id="push-the-button"><strong>Push The Button</strong></h2>
<p>If you choose to make use of the full screen real estate and switch to the capacitive buttons be prepared for them to disappoint. Being the wrong way around and also extremely poorly backlit. A non-issue once you get used to them. Which may take a while as after all they are the wrong way around!</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f8d68e3519.jpg" alt="" width="702" height="527" /></figure>
<p>Whereas the power and volume buttons are in the perfect position on such a large phone. Right in the middle of either side. They are good quality buttons with a reassuring click when pressed. However they are a little too far recessed into the phone. Making it slightly hard, and almost impossible when using a case.</p>
<p>It’s a little disappointing they didn’t to add a camera shutter key, if only to take up a bit more room on the side of the phone. This is where the quick launch gestures come in handy right? Well we will get to that soon enough.</p>
<h2 id="snap-happy"><strong>Snap Happy</strong></h2>
<p>Android Phones have always appeared to lag behind both the iPhone and Windows phone devices. Only until the current generation have we seen those that really compete on this level. OPO reviews have shown some great staged photos that appear to be taken by a high quality camera. In reality the ability of Sony’s Exmor IMX214 13-megapixel shooter is left lacking more than it should.</p>
<p>In anything other than perfect light it sometimes takes a couple of shots to get a great finished article. Which is normal when comparable to anything other than a Lumia at the moment. The CMOS sensor includes a great f/2.0 aperture, so in low light when it really matters the ability is good. Let down by poor software processing however. Leaving some photos noisy and washed out.</p>
<h2 id="next-camera"><strong>Next Camera</strong></h2>
<p>What pulls everything back together is the ‘Next Camera’ that comes stock on the OPO. The CM team has really worked on this to really show their ability. The capture rate is nothing short of incredible. Meaning I can fire off shots in amazing speed. Giving the HTC M8 a good run for its money you rarely missed the shot you want.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/885d88e1fd.jpg" alt="" width="702" height="395" /></figure>
<p>When shooting there are several filters to choose from with a swipe of the finger before shooting. These give the impression of pleasing the Instagram generation. What this does do is reduce the time to enter HDR mode to half the time of other apps. When using HDR expect the processed shots to be over exposed and sometimes unnatural. Giving results that appear to be from someone learning to Photoshop. There are two included in the gallery above.</p>
<p>Francois the audio and camera developer at Cyanogen has <a href="https://plus.google.com/117443191357357631171/posts/WvtREUY8TUB">also shown that there are big</a> improvements coming for the OPO, including RAW support. So there is a benefit to having constant development by CM. However some of the other software leaves a little to be desired.</p>
<h2 id="cyanogen-misses-the-mark"><strong>Cyanogen Misses The Mark</strong></h2>
<p>This is one area that has been left lacking. I have very rarely used Cyanogen before the OPO. Although the amount of users that speak highly of the ROM developer goliath is outstanding. Even on a Nexus device there appear to be bugs and unfortunately the OPO version CM11s is no different.</p>
<p>Nothing had been detrimentally wrong. However software features that don’t work on an end user device is unacceptable. Software fixes for a pretty big bug with the Wi-Fi toggle when using a theme has still not been applied to the ‘flagship killer’, despite being available for weeks in other software.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5ff95f319a.jpg" alt="" width="702" height="336" /></figure>
<p>As soon as you turn the device on I would turn the wake up gestures and double tap to wake off. Otherwise you risk turning on the torch or unlocking the phone in your pocket. I don’t think this version of CM11s would even class as a milestone build. A fix is coming so we have been told.</p>
<p>I realise that at the moment the OPO is aimed at those more ‘tech savvy’ than the average consumer. That’s a very good job because a normal consumer would not put up with CM11s as it is today. If OnePlus ever want to move forward they need to seriously consider doing so without Cyanogen on board. Or stepping their game up dramatically before they even consider releasing a general consumer handset.</p>
<h2 id="a-tweaker%E2%80%99s-dream"><strong>A Tweaker’s Dream</strong></h2>
<p>What CM11s does bring to the table is an almost endless array of personalisation tweaks and modifications. Far too many to go into detail here but expect favourites like customisable navigation bar, quick settings, and shortcut gestures. Meaning you can select as many or as few as you like.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4bdd85ec92.jpg" alt="" width="702" height="356" /></figure>
<p>What is amazing for customisation is Cyanogen’s new theme manager. The ability to change everything from boot animations and icons, to full on themes that change almost every pixel of Android. With hundreds of themes available straight from the Playstore. Want it to look like Android L, no problem. Even themes to implement LG or Touchwiz design if that’s your thing.</p>
<p>Cyanogen also bring along their security options to the OPO. The phone is not rooted out the box, so using banking apps and the like are not an issue. The stock kernel has bene patched to a much secure level than most devices available today. And with Whisper SMS you can encrypt your text messages with ease.</p>
<h2 id="tldr"><strong>tl;dr</strong></h2>
<p>Removing the software bugs I am in love with this device. The build quality and battery life are truly a wonder to behold. Using it will be enjoyable, once you are used to the size of the handset.</p>
<p>Whilst the screen is not pushing the pixels of the G3, it is bright and vivid. Combined with great sound from the speakers makes for great media consumption. The camera software is great combined with a good sensor. Which will only get better.</p>

     <p>We are now a mere day away from Google I/O, where Google is rumoured to be launching a new version of Android. What isn’t known is whether it will be Android 4.5 or 5.0. Not content with that Google have launched both 4.4.3 and 4.4.4 to AOSP and Nexus devices. However, a new threat has been discovered whilst digging around inside the fresh source code. <a href="https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/dbccd44a638ae8705a5b14bff8b2dd74abc26045/packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/statusbar/policy/HeadsUpNotificationView.java">Cyanogen team members have uncovered a new notification feature</a> called ‘Heads Up’. The CM team have managed to switch on the hidden code and implement it into their ROM.</p><p>This creates a notification similar to that implemented by the Paranoid Android Team with their ‘Hover’ feature. Created with immersive mode in mind, a notification does not disturb full screen activity. Instead creating a floating replication of the notification just below the status bar. These can be interacted with in the normal way, expanded or dismissed. All without having to leave your app or pull down the notification shade.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/189573ff9c.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="702" height="702" /></figure><h2 id="notification-heads-up">Notification Heads Up</h2><p>Starting with the <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/last-week-in-cm-jun-19-2014">CM ‘nightly’ from June 21st onwards</a>, Heads Up will be available to use. CM has not only switched on the feature, but implemented it with the notifications, system wide. All with the level of expertise we have come to know from the team. If there are some notifications you just don’t want to see in heads up. There is an option to switch off certain apps from doing so. Leaving only the important ones to make a bigger, bolder entrance onto your screen.</p><p>Full of intrigue we have tested out the brand new notification Heads Up. Testing out the feature in the June 21st ‘nightly’ for the Nexus 5, Nexus 7 and even the <a href="http://techdissected.com/editorials-and-discussions/two-weeks-with-the-htc-one-m8/">HTC One M8</a>. There are a few teething issues, but other than small issues, this works exactly as you would expect. You can interact with a notification in all ways you would expect. Tap to launch the app, swipe away or even use embedded interaction options. It has already proven to be useful in the short time testing. So much so that CM11 has now become my rom of choice.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/327d7a616e.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="702" height="702" /></figure><p>We can only speculate if these are meant to be used in the next version of android, or maybe never due to be used in android. They bear more than a passing resemblance to iOS notifications. With iOS8 to get interactive notifications, maybe this is an area Google will be pushing forward. Ready to stay one step ahead of iOS.</p><h2 id="don%E2%80%99t-want-to-flash">Don’t Want To Flash?</h2><p>Don’t worry if you don’t want to flash CM for the notification features. <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/mod-heads-notifications-t2791217">MohammedAG over on XDA Developers</a> has ported the feature over to Xposed. Joining such modules as <a href="http://techdissected.com/google/gravity-box-the-all-in-one-xposed-framework-module/">gravity box</a>, it offers custom rom like features to an otherwise stock rom. However you will have to root. In the interests of science we tried this on other roms and it works great on AOSP based roms. On non AOSP such as HTC Sense it does work very well. But misses some notifications. Remeber this is only v.1 of the notification enhancement so I am sure it will improve.</p><p>We are going to see an action packed I/O this year. <a href="http://techdissected.com/google/lg-g-watch-and-android-wear-what-do-we-know/">Android Wear and the LG G Watch</a>, <a href="http://techdissected.com/google/android/google-fit-to-be-released-at-google-io/">Google fit</a>, <a href="http://techdissected.com/google/android-tv-report-says-its-set-to-launch-at-io-2014/">Android TV</a> and what else. Maybe a new tablet with a new version of android? Maybe Android Silver? The Keynote starts at 9am PDT on June 25th. With the key note and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.samples.apps.iosched">several sessions streamed online</a> for those that are unable attend. In 2014 everything leaks! Somehow Google always manage to surprise us with something, what would you like to see?</p>

     <p>With each leak the excitement builds towards Google I/O. We are in for a jam packed keynote full of exciting information and new products. You only have to <a href="https://www.google.com/events/io/schedule">look at the I/O event schedule</a> to know that <a href="http://techdissected.com/google/lg-g-watch-and-android-wear-what-do-we-know/">Android Wear is coming</a>. Forbes has now revealed information about Google Fit, the fitness <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/06/12/exclusive-google-to-launch-health-service-google-fit-at-developers-conference/">service Google will be launching Google Fit to rival</a> Apple’s Health book.</p><p>In an attempt to avoid producing another dead resource like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Health">Google Health,</a> Google has chosen not to build jet another app or service to compete with already established brands. Google has instead created the Google Fit platform. Designed to collect and interpret data from other fitness trackers and health. And its ready to go live at Google I/O incorporated into no only <a href="http://techdissected.com/?s=android+wear">Android Wearables</a> but also smart phones.</p><h2 id="google-fit-for-all">Google Fit For All</h2><p>Google will release a Google Fit API at I/O. Any device manufacturer or application developer will then be able to plug directly into Google’s services. However it’s unclear if the service will need to be built into the Android OS or simply a stand alone Google Fit app. If they take the latter approach, data could also be collected from iOS and Windows phone users by launching a Google Fit app.</p><p>This will aid people that may use more than one wearable. Android Wear will collect daily data such as counting steps, then users could strap on a heart rate monitor when they go for a run later. All the data would be collected by Google Fit, stored in the Google Fit cloud, and maintained by the same app. A mammoth task as even vast wearable producers such as Nike have struggled to amalgamate data from Fuel Band users and Nike+ users and make the data meaningful.</p><p>Not to mention, allowing people to plug into older or rival collected data. Data could be collected form the heart rate monitor from the s5, old Fitbit data or even heart rate and exercise graphs.</p><h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2><p>It seems becoming the hub for all the data to be collected is the current trend. Apple have released Health Book as a platform to collect data from its handsets, expected to be joined by a wearable  later in the year. Health Book would be able to store similar data, including steps, heart rate, and sleep patterns.</p><p>Samsung have made similar efforts in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-27612110">form of SAMI</a>. Critics have been quick to move against Google’s data harvesting. Similar noises have been made to Google Fit as after the Nest acquisition. The fear is that Google will target ads based on the health data collected by Google Fit. They could however do this with any Google Now or Android Wear related information. Imagine an advert for a performance boost just as you’re starting to slow down during a run or even worse, medication and procedure adverts for those suffering from the detected condition.</p><h2 id="google-fit-already-in-android-wear">Google Fit Already In Android Wear</h2><p>Android Police have once again done their homework and <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/06/12/forbes-google-prepping-google-fit-to-collect-and-manage-fitnesshealth-data/">delved deep into the leaked Android wear system dump</a> from the <a href="http://techdissected.com/google/lg-g-watch-and-android-wear-what-do-we-know/">LG G Watch,</a> and ripping apart the ClockworkHomeGoogle.apk has shown a “retail mode”. This mentions ‘reaching fitness goals through a built-in pedometer’. They also uncovered that the new play services is able to collect wearable data and plug it straight into Google Fit.</p><p>Google have done their homework, and have waited until the wearable they release is as packed full of features as possible. Google I/O is now only days away, and Google are bound to still have a few tricks to show us. What else can they possibly pack into the conference?</p>

     <p>Technology is getting to a stage where it will be a true aid for the disabled. Google have yet to realise the true potential of project Tango in aiding the disabled. However Microsoft are the latest company to try and improve quality of life as much as possible. Trailing a head band that will help the visually impaired navigate the world.</p><p>Microsoft’s break through ‘Alice Band’ will help the blind and visually impaired become much more independent. Using cutting edge technology to aid in navigating staircases, elevators and escalators. Currently being used by a group of eight blind people in Reading, UK</p><p>Microsoft have detailed the built-in Microsoft customised sensors. These all in one sensors that have been custom built to detect the proximity of surrounding objects. All of the information is processed by the band and then interpreted through audio signals to an earpiece worn by the user.</p><h2 id="microsoft-now"><strong>Microsoft Now</strong></h2><p>All of this information is dependent on specialised sensors installed all over the world around the user. Signals will need to ‘bounce off’ objects in order to map the surrounding world. Relying completely on installation of these sensors in every location. This may be plausible in the home, however systems such as Google project Tango does not require these installing. So is likely to stall adoption of Microsoft system.</p><p>The hope is that localised sensors will enable contextual information on the world around the user. Relaying information on journey time, any delays in transport expected and personalised instructions. Part of a much wider push by Microsoft into wearable technology. Including a much rumoured smart watch or even Google Glass rival.</p><h2 id="smart-city"><strong>Smart City</strong></h2><p>Microsoft new projects are made whilst working with Future Cities Catapult on a program <a href="https://futurecities.catapult.org.uk/project-full-view/-/asset_publisher/oDS9tiXrD0wi/content/project-cities-unlocked/">called Cities Unlocked</a>. The UK Government is putting in place incentives with several organisations to push into a new wave of ‘Smart Cities’.</p><p>The UK is also implementing internet of things (IoT) networks in major cities to welcome in the age of the wearable and smart objects. Granted this network is only rolling out in ten major cities in the UK to start, but will roll out nationwide. These will mirror such networks that have already been set up in other European countries such as France and Spain.</p><h2 id="internet-of-things"><strong>Internet Of Things</strong></h2><p>At the moment there are small numbers of connected devices. However forecasts from the likes of <a href="http://www.ericsson.com/news/110214_more_than_50_billion_244188811_c">Ericsson</a> have predicted there may be as many as 50billion ‘things’ connected to the internet by 2020. The network uses ‘ultra narrow’ band connectivity, due to the communications containing tiny amounts of data.</p><p>“It will essentially be a piece of work that’s similar to building a new mobile network, just using a slightly different technology” said Wendy McMillan, the head of the Arqiva’s frightening titled machine-to-machine services. They are hoping that building the network, and mirroring others globally, before things really take off will mean that that this protocol is the only one used.</p><p>The required infrastructure for all the smart things to communicate will be in place soon. Meaning the sky is the limit for integrating smart things into our lives. Making people with disabilities a priority is a great business model. As these are the people that really need the help to have a great quality of life.</p>

     <p>After leaks by Edward Snowden the level of data harvesting by GCHQ has been at the forefront of the news. Privacy and protection of personal data has become a major concern for individuals and large corporations alike. The UK government is moving quickly to quash the effects a European ruling will have on accessing and storing our data.</p><p>A European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling earlier this year looked to change the ability to hold and store that data. Ruling that communications service providers (CSP’s) were not at liberty to adhere to the 2006 Data Retention Directive, meaning that they didn’t have to store data of its customer’s activity for anywhere up to 24 months.</p><p>The emergency data law is mainly aimed at these communications companies to bring clarity to their position. The fear is that CSPs might start deleting communications data. Such data being of paramount importance in the security agencies fight against terrorism. Prime Minster David Cameron said if the information were to be deleted, or no longer collected, it would seriously impede the UK’s ability to fight crime and protect the country against terrorism.</p><h2 id="meta-data"><strong>Meta Data</strong></h2><p>Set to run until 2016, when the law will be reviewed. There will be outlines for the legal obligation of the collection of all communications data by CSP’s. Data collected will include when calls were made, what numbers were dialled, and other information that can be used. However it does not include the content of the communications. Security agencies will still need a warrant to access this data.</p><p>A warrant would need to be signed by the foreign secretary, the home secretary, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, the defence secretary or the cabinet secretary for justice for Scotland. So would not be easy to obtain for other than those of paramount importance.</p><p>This will all be overlooked by a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. To advise the government policy on counterterrorism. Producing a report aimed at bringing transparency to the government’s actions and access to communications. Following such a move by Facebook, Google and Apple. The report will detailing the number and type of requests made to communication firms.</p><h2 id="privacy-concerns"><strong>Privacy Concerns</strong></h2><p>This doesn’t mean that the government will be able to listen to your calls, and read your emails. Not more than they are already able to anyway.The data that will be stored is simply who you are contacting and when. There will be no content stored or intercepted without a warrant. And the amount of organisations that could have this type of access is being reduced.</p><p>However this does not cover any monitoring activities carried out by the UK’s intelligence agency, GCHQ. They are free to intercept and store huge amounts of information about citizens’ online activity. They are not governed by this shake up of data interception. This is to improve investigations in to smaller crimes and back up alibis given by suspects.</p><p>It’s clear there are privacy concerns with the interception and storing of vast amounts of personal data. However the latest move is to improve the image and transparency of such acts. Matching similar moves by big businesses to be open and honest about your data. As well as ensuring that the essential data is still captured to aid in anti-terrorism investigations.</p>

     <p>In the latest move in the saga that is the right to be forgotten law, the UK government has asked for it to be removed from the new European Union data protection laws. Opposing having another law dictated by the European Union, and bringing more controversy and debate into the almost farcical ‘Law’.</p><p>Under the new law individuals have the right to request Google search results be removed that are “inadequate or no longer relevant”. This has lead to around 70,000 people making the request to Google in just two months. They received around 30,000 request in the first two weeks to remove search results that infringe an individual’s privacy.</p><blockquote>The government is currently negotiating with our 27 partners to get a new law, which is the new directive and we, the UK, would not want what is currently in the draft, which is the Right to be forgotten, to remain. We want it to be removed, we think it is the wrong position – Justice Minister, Simon Hughes</blockquote><p>Since being put into place, both technology commentators and media outlets alike have been up in arms. Both the BBC and The Guardian have voiced concerns and argued that content which is outdated still has relevance and this ruling is one step towards media censorship. Being now joined by the UK  Minister for Justice Simon Hughes, who agrees that being deleted from search engines including Google at the request of individuals, should not be administered by the EU.</p><blockquote>I don’t think as an individual and as a minister that we want the law to develop in the way that is implied by this judgment that you close down access to information in the EU, which is open in the rest of the world – Justice Minister, Simon Hughes</blockquote><p>There are several issues with the right to be forgotten. Not to mention that there are other search engines that exist. Information will still be shown on Yahoo and Bing search. Without taking into account searches on individual sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google plus. There are so many ways that this action just will not work.</p><h2 id="we-know-what%E2%80%99s-been-removed"><strong>We Know What’s Been Removed</strong></h2><p>As soon as a Google search is made, it is obvious results have been removed. Google search shows a warning at the bottom of the page stating some results ‘may’ be missing. Whats more if the listing is from a news publication they are made aware of this. Google sends a letter stating “We regret to inform you that we are no longer able to show the following pages from your website in response to certain searches on European versions of Google search.”</p><blockquote>These examples show what a nonsense the right to be forgotten is. It is the equivalent of going into libraries and burning books you don’t like. There is no suggestion any of these articles are inaccurate – Martin Clarke, MailOnline</blockquote><p>The MailOnline will now publish a list of all articles that are deleted from Google’s search results. One high profile case is that of former banker Mr. O’Neal from the BBC blog. An article written back in 2007 by Robert Preston was highly critical of the then Merrill Lynch banker. Resigning after bad investments and making huge losses. This blog post is now removed from Google search results in Europe. But it’s unsure of who by.</p><blockquote>Is the data in it ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant’? Hmmm. Most people would argue that it is highly relevant for the track record, good or bad, of a business leader to remain on the public record. Especially someone widely seen as having played an important role in the worst financial crisis in living memory  – Robert Preston</blockquote><h2 id="specific-google-search"><strong>Specific Google Search</strong></h2><p>Google is only at liberty to filter specific Google search results. Meaning that there is a very easy route around this. Less specific searches. Making a less specific request to Google search would list result that may have been removed in a more specific request. Techaeris have to be very careful what we show in Google search results for so we can only present a general example.</p><p>Google search for a specific celebrity, and search results could very well be filtered. Having such things as drug problems, arrests or promiscuity deleted from Google search. However search for celebrities with drug problems, would bring up all related results. Including those the celebrity requested to be deleted. This is because the online information doesn’t disappear, just the way it is displayed in search.</p><h2 id="deleted-in-europe-only"><strong>Deleted In Europe Only</strong></h2><p>The thing to remember is this ruling only happened in Europe. So although anyone can request information to be removed, it will only be left out of European based Google search. So consider everything inside Europe to be not the full story when you Google search. As with everything there are always way around the internet.</p><p>Searching through a disguised proxy will bring up an unfiltered search result. But simply switching to use Google search outside of Europe will do this. Switch to using Google.com will lose some local searching, but will give true results.</p><p>So it would seem that all the effort and costs that individuals such as Mr O’Neil have gone to fight for this right to be forgotten has been pointless. Google search has done as asked despite its protests. Filter Google search results that have a valid reason to be forgotten. Yet still the information is readily available on the internet. The only way for it truly disappear is to remove it from the source.</p><h2 id="google-is-not-the-internet"><strong>Google Is Not The Internet</strong></h2><p>The internet can both empower and harm an individual in equal amounts. In a generation that the internet is in such a prevalent place there is a need to be aware of its power. The printing press had been invented 150 years before its true worth and usefulness was realised. It will take much longer for the internet. Society is still working out where and how the internet fits in with our lives, leading to wildly differing opinions of its purpose and the level of control we have over it.</p><p>Although many users are completely tied into the Google ecosystem, governments and courts seem to think Google <strong><strong>is</strong></strong> the internet. Perhaps Google has become too all-encompassing of the internet for its own good. Everything that involves internet use seems to be levied against Google specifically even though it is not the gatekeeper to the World Wide Web.</p><h2 id="learn-to-accept"><strong>Learn To Accept</strong></h2><p>The old expression in the UK is that today’s news is tomorrow’s chip paper. Meaning that news soon fades into nothing and people soon forget. Allowing lives to move forward. In the world of the internet this couldn’t be further from the truth. A quick Google search will reveal anything published about anyone. Especially for those that have less general names, a search may only yield negative information.</p><p>The issues surrounding Google search are extremely difficult. Things that are no longer relevant, such as the test case involving a bankruptcy 10 years ago, should be allowed to fade into the forgotten. But should embarrassing or negative results be allowed to be deleted from the internet. Just because you don’t agree with them doesn’t make them less true.</p><p>I am not sure this issue will ever be resolved by filtering online. Maybe society needs to become more understanding about negative press. There are undoubtedly things that people need to know about their fellow man. But learn to take into account the fact that people make mistakes, it doesn’t make them a worse human being for it. In fact it may very well have improved them.</p>

     <p>In the 16 years <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> has been active the world, along with its business model, has dramatically changed. The small start up aimed to streamline internet users experience, is now one of the worlds largest corporations. At its heart it still wants to be a start up. Google is still a search company, but its reach has grown so far there is barely an industry without its involvement.</p><p>But where can Google possibly go to now. With advertising revenues projected to decline as users become more aware of them. The vast majority of Google’s income may dry up. It must grow and evolve to maintain its dominance. Or suffer the same fate that have happened to huge companies before. So OK Google, where to next?</p><h2 id="search-and-adverts">Search And Adverts</h2><p>It was the idea that started it all. Sure search existed before but other systems used simple ranking by how many times the search term appeared on the page. Ranking pages by a simple count. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, whilst studying at Stanford, researched a better system taking in account the relationships between websites. And PageRank was born, making decisions on the page relevance and importance of pages.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/2eb39a9239.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="702" height="57" /></figure><p>Google is still very much rooted in search, most of its services make Google search and services prevalent. Gmail for example, is one big contextual search of your inbox. Leading to the appeal of a service that is faster and easier to use than competing services. No user of Android can avoid the search bar on the launcher, and Google search capabilities are the root of the new Android Wear and Android TV.</p><p>It’s maintained its core business, now leading the competitors by more than <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Market-Rankings/comScore-Releases-May-2014-US-Search-Engine-Rankings">triple the number of search users</a>. This means only one thing for Google, Adverts. Ad revenue accounts for the vast majority of Google’s income. Still managing to <a href="http://investor.google.com/earnings/2013/Q4_google_earnings.html">increase ad clicks and cost per click</a> year on year. With Google search able to display ads to you that are relevant to not just your search. But you as an individual. Make a search for a product and you mite be chased around the internet by an ad for it for weeks.</p><p><em>We show that brand-keyword ads have no measurable short-term benefits. For non-brand keywords we find that new and infrequent users are positively influenced by ads. But that more frequent users whose purchasing behaviour is not influenced by ads account for most of the advertising expenses. Resulting in average returns that are negative.Consumer Heterogeneity and Paid Search Effectiveness: A Large Scale Field Experiment</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/0a3cb43535.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="702" height="336" /></figure><p>But research by <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w20171.pdf">eBay may just be able to quantify</a> the falling advert success. The opinion that users don’t click on search and Adsense adverts any longer seems to be true. Advertisement techniques grow and change over time. From radio and TV adverts, to online banners ads to now targeted adverts. Users eventually become ‘immune’ to the effects. Where will Google be without ads?</p><p>Lets not forget it doesn’t just make money from its own ads. It makes them from ads all over the internet and mobile. Ever accidentally clicked an advert whilst playing Angry birds or similar. Thats making money not just for the developer, but for Google too. After taking 30% off the cost of paid apps, it also takes a slice of anything made from placed ads or in app purchases later on too.</p><h2 id="android">Android</h2><p>The operating system that almost didn’t see the light day day is now more than 80% of the total market. As of March 2013 there were 1 billion Android devices in use. And another 1.5 million devices activated every single day. Each device primed to sell not only applications, music and films. But also Google services such as Gmail, Google plus and Google search. Storing masses of user data including location, usage and interests. All ripe for serving directed mobile advertising.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/e2e4623c3a.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="702" height="142" /></figure><p>Android OS cost millions to develop and bring to life. And further millions each year to keep constantly updating and pushing the OS to keep pace with competition. Google then gives this all away for free through open source. Now this isn’t a debate on how open Android really is, but the fact is millions each year developing is given away for free. All in the hope of making it back through other avenues.</p><p>The use of Android also ties users into using other Google services. It provides them with a Gmail address and a Google plus account. Not to mention services such as Google Drive and  Calendar. All in the hope of gaining data to display ads. This must be working for Google as its pushing for the next billion from emerging markets <a href="http://techdissected.com/google/android/android-one-pushing-for-the-next-billion/">with Android One</a>. As well as exploring where else it can put adverts. Creating unique hardware to gain more and more users for Android.</p><h2 id="google-content-everywhere">Google Content Everywhere</h2><p>The best way from Google to do this is to put Android on every screen you own. Launching Android Wear, Android TV and even Android Auto at <a href="http://techdissected.com/news/google-io-2014-day-one-recap-android-all-the-things/">Google I/O 2014</a>. Google will be on more screens and own more services than ever before.</p><p>There is no adverts placed on Android Wear at the moment, although that may change in the future. Its aim is to gain more user data and lock users into Android further. Where as <a href="http://techdissected.com/google/android-tv-more-than-just-a-smart-tv/">Android TV is aimed to gain a</a> reliable and consistent income from media. Providing Google Movies and TV along with Google Music.</p><p>In a similar move to its Play Music All Access service. It is only a matter of time before Google goes after subscription services such as Netflix. However even competitors such as Spotify have struggled to make profit at all. <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-growth-not-making-big-183316270.html">It now has over 10 million subscribers</a>. Yet still falls in the red.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/e6bae15266.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="702" height="331" /></figure><p>So moves into content and media may just be to pull an Apple. Tie users into as much content as possible so its harder to switch platforms. Gathering as much data as possible in the mean time. Google is very willing to develop technology to serve its ends. That being displaying adverts. Spending billions in research to provide something new. Putting ads on your thermostat, watch and even right to your eye with Google Glass. Is all a possibility given opportunity.</p><h2 id="google-likes-its-labs">Google Likes Its Labs</h2><p>Also not shy of spending some of its cash reserves. Google has been purchasing companies in varying fields for some time. It acquired Nest Labs for $3.2 billion to strengthen its push into bringing Android into home automation. Initially keeping all data separate it will go live in october with rolling all the data into Google Now. Should the owner give permission for this. Its yet to be seen if this data will be used to display ads to users.</p><p>However this and the resulting purchase of Dropcam for $555million adds other revenue streams to Google. Making the thermostat and smoke alarms available in Google Play store. Dropcam’s monthly and yearly subscriptions mean a different revenue stream than just adverts. Enabling the push for current users to move to Android from other platforms.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/0c817e76f1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="702" height="336" /></figure><p>Amongst the acquisitions Google made a huge move for a confusing area in artificial intelligence and automatons. At the end of 2013 it had purchased 8 companies that either made or had direct links with robots. The jewel being huge military backed robot maker Boston Dynamics, alone having a $10.8 million contract with the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).</p><p>Several wild and wonderful market moves have been suggested for Google’s move into robotics. From walking talking adverts to the next level in automated personal assistants. But the move remains a head scratcher. Andy Rubin’s fascination in robots can’t be the only motivator to spend millions upon millions of dollars.</p><p>Despite Google protests it would be impossible to move into this field without government defence contracts. At least in the short term. As none of the Boston Dynamics products are aimed anywhere near retail applications. Although aiming towards manufacturing and processing will allow revenue beyond specific military areas.</p><h2 id="xlabs-and-moon-shots">XLabs And Moon Shots</h2><p>The pinnacle of Google’s outlandish spending is Google legendary XLabs. The top secret area where engineers develop cutting edge technology. Also receiving funding for huge gambles and so called ‘Moon shots’. These advances are to see what engineers really can achieve given the chance. It is impossible to know how many projects fail. But several projects have appeared from the X Labs and do generate an income to Google.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/878ad295eb.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="702" height="313" /></figure><p>Such as Google’s self driving cars, the technology is set to be put into cars in the next 12-18 months. <a href="http://www.google.com/loon/">Project Loon to bring internet access to less developed areas</a>. This has received funding from carriers and is set to go into more extensive testing. Also Google Glass, the social dividing face computer that <a href="https://www.google.com/glass/start/">Google claim is the future</a>. This may not pay back the millions put into development, but it clearly is an area Google is willing to fund. If only to gain information to use in Google Now development.</p><h2 id="this-isn%E2%80%99t-the-end">This Isn’t The End</h2><p>Google is clearly moving into other areas of income to prop up a predicted decline in advertising revenue. However it clear this is not happening just yet. Around 95% of Google’s revenue is still linked to advertising. There are many areas that Google could choose to put its ads on. Much like the apps in the app store. The vast majority of service are free, providing you can put up with a few ads.</p><p>With even a few inservice purchases thrown in for good measure. If the adverts are apparently not working, and not intrusive. Users are obviously willing to put up with them in exchange for great services. Would users pay for a version of service without the ads? Or is Google set to become a freemium service?</p>

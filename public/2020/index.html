<p>Just in time for the holidays Apple released <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/go/apple_fitness_plus/">Fitness +</a> to the masses and it’s actually pretty good. The barrier to entry unfortunately is pretty high, needing an Apple Watch and a subscription, but I’ve tried it out a little due to having the Premier Apple One Bundle.</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to get into yoga, but after attending a few ‘beginners classes’ that were definitely not for beginners, Fitness + has allowed me to get going at my pace. There are a huge range of workouts (not an ad) and I’ve enjoyed some HIIT training, with the only downside not being able to change the music and most of it is rubbish!</p>
<p>The biggest thing I have discovered though is the huge amount of these types of videos available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=workout">for free on YouTube</a>. Sure you don’t get the integration and display of your move-rings on screen, but some of them are brilliantly done. Just another thing that could help if your New Year’s resolution is to work out more, and it might just cut down your spending to — no one needs an expensive gym subscription.</p>

<p>At the moment I am fascinated by the beliefs of others. Not religious or cultural thinking, but the rise of anti-vaccination belief and the other crazy conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>I think this has been exaggerated by COVID-19, but I have always had an interest in the weird things that go on inside other peoples head. Lord knows I have plenty of weird things going on in mine. I am still not sure if there is a stark rise in the existence of people that believe in crazy conspiracy theories, or that they just have the ability to shout louder now.</p>
<p>The psychology of this type of thinking is not linked to intelligence as most people believe, but in fact the higher IQ the person has they can stick much firmer to their beliefs and come up with a greater argument for them. It has more to do with tribalism and the beliefs you have being an indicator of the group you belong to.</p>
<blockquote><p>Motivated reasoning is how people convince themselves or remain convinced of what they want to believe—they seek out agreeable information and learn it more easily; and they avoid, ignore, devalue, forget, or argue against information that contradicts their beliefs. — <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/this-article-wont-change-your-mind/519093/">Julie Beck</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The stories we tell others are a test to see who we believe we can trust. The way people react tells us if they are a person we wish to have around and there would be many anthropological benefits to this. But when you don’t have 150 people around you, you have millions online the weirder the behaviour is.</p>
<p>Think about this when interacting with others over the holiday period. I know we may not be sharing a dinner table with as many people as usual, but you’re still going to come across people that do not believe the same things as you. This doesn’t make them an idiot, it makes them human, try as hard as you can to learn something from the conversations you have — because getting mad gets you nowhere.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Since the launch of iOS14 we’ve seen an influx of widgets for your Home Screen. Apple having finally launched a viable way for you to not only customise the look of your phone, but also gain access to information you need at a glance. So being the health conscious individual I am, I wanted something to help me display the data I need at a glance right on my home-screen and here it is – <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1493350670">Fitness Totals</a>.</p>
<p>Managing your long terms fitness goals can be extremely difficult and many options out there seemed to be aimed at athletes rather than those that want to just get active, or shed a bit of the Christmas plump put on over the festive period. Instead of making you feel out of place, Fitness Totals places the emphasis on your weekly and monthly activity totals. Giving you the option to display walking/running, but also cycling, swimming, and wheelchair pushes/distance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b3e0dc623a.jpg" alt="Image 1" title="Image-1.png" border="0" width="1000" height="368" /><br />
You can choose from a whole range of different widget options in both light and dark mode, as well as 14 different app icons. Meaning that you can tailor the experience to your taste and view the data you value, whenever you need it.</p>
<p>I have been testing the app through its beta period and finding it extremely useful for comparing those stats that really matter to me. Having taken up cycling this year, and particularly enjoying walks with my dog, it’s great to get all the data I value but not have to worry about starting workouts or feeding my information into another service. Fitness Totals plugs straight into Apple Health and uses on device processing, so your data <a href="https://fitnesstotals.com/#container02">never leaves your phone</a>. You <em>can</em> send your fitness totals to others if you choose to. The sharing features are particularly useful for a bit of friendly competition and give you a bit of a push!</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re active like me or just thinking about a New Year’s resolution. You can download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1493350670">Fitness Totals</a> from the App Store for just £2.99 and keep focused on your health.</p>

<p>After reading <a href="https://tablethabit.substack.com/p/newsletters-vs-blogging?r=7zbud&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=copy">Jeff Perry recent change of heart</a> regarding running a newsletter it really got me thinking about publishing. Whilst I agree wholeheartedly that publishing your work should be as easily available as possible there is just something about writing a newsletter that isn’t the same as a blog post.</p>
<p>Could it be the way I write my blog posts? Perhaps it’s the more personal touch of popping my thoughts into something that appears in your inbox — I’m not really to sure — but I could never stop writing this. I am pleased with the mix I have between reviewing phones and posting tech things, and then sharing short, completely ad-hoc thoughts in a more personal way. I never thought I would get as many readers as I do (I only check subscribers before I send the latest edition, there’s no tracking in my emails) and I am still surprised when people sign up!</p>
<p>Although there are many paid for newsletters that make a huge splash in niche industries or offer a unique personality, you have to earn the right to ask for money first in most instances. Sub-stack is not the best place for sharing your thoughts and ideas, it is a weird hybrid of newsletter and blog that putts too many hurdles in the way of reading in my honest opinion — perhaps Jeff would have been better doing it on Ghost? Who knows, but Jeff is awesome guy and is posting on <a href="https://tablethabit.com/">Tablethabbit.com</a>again.</p>

<p>One of the great things about writing about how you feel is having to first understand what you <em>do</em> actually feel. Understanding what is going on inside your own mind and who you actually are is one of the hardest things because so often all of these feelings and motivations are on a non verbal level. Very often it isn’t until I see the self expression of someone else I realise I feel like that too, but never knew how to communicate it.</p>
<p>This is one of the huge problems with living in a world of algorithms and curated feeds of information. The AI used to find tune each and everything we see now understands us — the real us, the internal us — far better than we can ever hope to. It understand us and what we need to see to get the best possible result. Surrounding us in a bubble of our own feelings reflected back at us by others.</p>
<p>So when we step out of this haze and interact with people that don’t think and react like we do, it’s a shock to the system. Our self centred nature allows us to completely ignore the feelings of people around us because we are so internally focused on ourselves that we don’t understand any other way. It takes effort to understand the way others think and the reasons behind the way they react.</p>
<p>Too much effort for us to bother with. So we close ourself off in our own curated world, attempt to cancel anything we don’t like and carry on. Why resist. Being surrounded by an environment that understand us, breeds our thoughts and shapes our desires in their own image makes us content. Why bother to understand anyone else not like us. We are happy in this state, but we are not living.</p>

     <p>Before starting anything I do, no matter how small I find it important to think about what success in this task looks like. Some things are very simple, you don’t need to comprehend the end result of taking your rubbish out, but the benefit of thinking about the desired outcome for all of your tasks proves very beneficial.</p><p>Success is completely different for different people, and dependant on what the task at hand is. For many of the things I do on a daily basis it is producing something physical. Something I can hold in my hand or look at on a screen and be happy with. So success for me in these task is producing something that fulfils, or exceeds, the vision I had for it when I started. Taking an idea and forming a blog post about it is pretty easy, my success is producing something I can hit publish on.</p><p>I do not measure my success on the amount of views, likes or whatever metrics surround it. However it <em>is</em> important to consider this in other situations. So what does success look like to you? When do you consider this before starting a task? Try thinking about it before diving in, not afterwards, and you will see just how successful you <em>really</em> are.</p>

<p>Above is a screenshot of my second brain. Taken from the compact graph view of <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> showing all of the things I have typed into it in the last few months and their connections to each other. I have fallen off a little recently and being lax in typing out my morning pages and keeping track of everything (see point above about habits) but this is truly one of the best platforms I have ever become invested in.</p>
<p>It contains all of my meeting notes, all of my to-do lists, all of my morning pages as well as everything else you would use a note app for. Combine this with <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise</a>, and it is starting to truly be my second brain and helping me retain more important stuff than ever. I have around 200 book and article notes stored in Roam, and the platform forms relationships between them without me doing anything, surfacing information to me at various points in the day to aid my life.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if I am writing meeting notes, or a blog post, I can easily research any topics and Roam will give me prompts when I have covered the same things before even if I have not linked them together before. Leading to me to retain much less things in my brain and allowing me to concentrate on what is really important. So referring to Roam as a note taking app, and sneering at the price is redundant to me and many others that find the value that it provides priceless.</p>

<p>Listen. My iPhone 12 Pro review is about 3 weeks late at this point and may never see the light of day unless I pull my finger out. The words I have been trying to write abut this phone have been some of the hardest I have ever produced. Not because the iPhone 12 Pro isn’t good, it’s great, but because it doesn’t spark anything in me.</p>
<p>If you’ve used an iPhone in the last, well ever, you know what you’re getting and this new model is no different. In years gone by this would just be the new iPhone. Everyone would buy it and then be on their merry way to another year of iPhone use. But now, Apple produced a full-line up of iPhones and this year the iPhone 12 Pro sits <em>in the middle</em> and confuses pretty much everything.</p>
<p>So, when I set my hands on the iPhone 12 Mini it sparked something in me that I have not felt for a while. It was the same old iOS device I love, but it was different for a change. A truly modern smartphone in a small package (something like the iPhone 5s style) with pretty much nothing taken away.</p>
<p>This phone wins for me. I bought all three sizes this year and this by far is my favourite to use. I have returned all the others but kept this little bundle of joy. Half the time I don’t know where I have put my phone now, and that is the reason I love it so much.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>One question has been stuck in my brain for the last week or so. One that was not flippantly asked, but asked with conviction and pursuing a real answer. <a href="https://twitter.com/zcichy">Zac Cichy</a> pressed his <a href="https://www.projecthuman.fm/show/2-rene-ritchie">guest Rene Richie</a> to see if people at Apple actually think about the changes that their products and services <em>actually</em> make to not only their users, but also society at large.</p>
<p>This sounds like an obvious question, and one that was answered quite honestly by Rene, being that Steve Jobs and to a certain point many people at Apple, have a more positive view point when talking about their products or advancements in technology. With a natural blind spot to all the bad things that these can also cause. For every boost in communication and productivity gain you get a Facebook and Google (his choice of companies not mine, although I would agree with them).</p>
<blockquote><p>This invention has the power to drastically alter the nature of human existence. I think it could help humanity. But it could also make things even worse. — Ready Player Two</p></blockquote>
<p>We trust the brands we invest in, with both our money and our attention, to have the best interests of their users in mind when producing their products. Which in the vast majority of cases is well-founded. However, there are companies where it is more obvious their intentions are more nefarious.</p>
<p>In Steven Levy book “<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B081R296DR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o04">Facebook: The Inside Story</a>” he goes into great detail, whilst being led by several people that are familiar with the matter, on Facebooks problems and therefore its users problems. Brought about by its relentless pursuit of growth at all costs. “Chasing growth that hadn’t happened naturally, attempting to crush competitors” and a leader hell-bent on becoming everything that Facebook wasn’t.</p>
<p>One “unintended consequence” after another proves that not all people think about this stuff, or instead are so shortsighted that it doesn’t even register. Undoubtedly, this happens in every single company on the face of the planet at some stage or another. With every great stride forward comes another towards a future of more technology ingress into our lives, something that can be amazingly positive but also end life as we know it!</p>
<p>I hope to god people think about this stuff, but I have my doubts, and if they do I don’t think they do it hard enough.</p>

<p>As much as I would love to peach about minimalism some more, the best thing to others that don’t subscribe to to the same view point is to try and remind others about the manipulation involved.</p>
<p>Shopping is such a minefield I only managed to make sense of it once I took a step back and saw it for what it was. Companies trying to make more money in the endless pursuit of growth. Something that is understandable, manipulative but also something you don’t have to subscribe to.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I am a few days away from deciding on which iPhone 12 size to go for and it’s making me think deeper about myself than I am comfortable with. It’s a ridiculous issue to have, but it’s one that I have, so here we are.</p>
<p>For the last few years I have bought the new iPhone released no questions asked. iPhone 5s, 6, 6s plus, 7, X, XS Max and 11 pro. I chose each phone with little hesitation and carried on my merry way without a second thought. Something changed halfway through my time with the 11pro and I realised just how little I was using my £1000 smartphone, so I sold it and used an iPhone SE until the iPhone 12 launch.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Well, this just gives you backstory because this year the line up brings me so much indecision that I ordered three phones! Which is great and all but I now can’t decide which one to use.</p>
<p>There is enough between them to make the choice important, but this issue speaks about my current situation more than it does about the phones themselves. In a pandemic and working from home perhaps dictates a different choice in technology, and whilst I felt the Pixel 5 was made in a pandemic I think the iPhone 12 range is made for a very different work to the one we have now.</p>
<h2>Which User Am I?</h2>
<p>The iPhone 12 mini is the phone I want to be a user of. It’s small, light and fills me with minimalistic dreams that I can’t ignore. It’s everything I want from a smartphone, and most of all it leaves much less a mark on my life than the others do.</p>
<p>The iPhone 12 Pro is my default. It’s boring, unassuming but very able to do pretty much everything. It’s the compromise phone and consumes enough of the others in the line ability to potentially be <a href="https://twitter.com/gr36/status/1329829511341469700?s=21">my Goldilocks phone</a>.</p>
<p>The iPhone 12 Pro Max is me giving into my desires and getting what I really want. It caters to my narcissistic urges, is the most powerful and unapologetically massive. You can’t use it one handed very well but it does what it does best and gives you arguably the best media experience. It’s fulfilling my fear of missing out and does more than everything else.</p>
<p>There’s a huge difference between getting what I want and what I need. The iPhone 12 Pro Max is great in some situations but due to its size feels a little like wearing skis all year because you go in the winter. Whereas I know which phone I should use, to remove it as much from my life as possible.</p>
<p>These issues are all internal, and I am aware of this entirely. It’s a stupid issue to have, but I think about it nonetheless. Which one I choose my speak more about myself than actually about the phone.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>After touching on the subject in <a href="https://gr36.com/gtt/gtt-18/">last weeks newsletter</a>, I am inspired by Matt Birchler (once again) to push into <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/my-productivity-goals-for-the-week/">finding free apps to replace subscriptions</a>. His new productivity goals have this pegged as number one and I think it’s really important to think about doing the same.</p>
<p>Monthly or yearly subscriptions are great, they support development of apps a services and make sure they receive the money that they deserve. There are more than few I could not live without, <a href="https://gr36.com/one-year-of-the-ipad-pro-as-my-computer/">Ulysses</a> and <a href="https://gr36.com/favourite-hey-features/">Hey</a> to name two of my favourite. However it is really easy to get carried away and just pony up for an app that offers little value or simply because everyone else uses it.</p>
<p>I am a huge believer it not relying on <a href="https://gr36.com/a-new-productivity-app-wont-make-you-more-productive/">yet another app to make you more productive</a>, you will simply spend more time moving and learning the app than getting things done, and use it as an excuse to procrastinate more. As Matt says in his post “Saving money and reminding myself another tool will not solve my problems” is the right approach to take.</p>
<p>I have recently moved back to using many stock apps instead of renewing subscriptions and in times like these it has saved me quite a bit of money. It also improves internal motivation to get things done, it is <em>me</em> that can get things done not the app. Use whatever it is you have to hand, a pen and paper are often the best tools to use and it might even help you detach from your smartphone or computer for a little while.</p>
<p>I’d love to know more free alternatives <em>you</em> have been using to help you get things done. It doesn’t have to be a task manager or email app. What is a job you used to get done by paying money and have now found a system that is free (or next to free)? <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=hey%20%40gr36%20check%20this%20out%20">Get in touch</a>, because I would love to share tips and tricks to others that could benefit from new ideas.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve been delving into origin stories of some of my sons favourite superhero’s and it got me thinking about mine. You might think I have been around here for ages. Bleating on about Apple news like some kind of village idiot and generally writing things no one reads. However, my Apple usage has been a relatively short one, and started at random points during the last 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone</strong></p>
<p>I came to the iPhone really early in its life but was gone quickly. I managed to convince my mum to get me an iPhone 3G on a ridiculously expensive monthly contract about 2 weeks after it came out. At the time I had a Nokia N73 and touchscreen phones were the way to go, but nothing came close to the iPhone.</p>
<p>After this brief time with a 3G I left and never looked back. Then began a long stream of Android phones that when I look at now, although fun to use, never lived up to an iPhone. The problem was, iPhones were much more expensive and exclusive to one network, which meant they were impossible to consider for quite a while.</p>
<p>I resisted is as long as I could but came back again to the iPhone 5s. It was the first iPhone for a while reviewers were raving about and I was looking for something to work with my iPad. Couple this and my blossoming love for the iMac meant that an iPhone just made sense.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/69456a8f5b.jpg" alt="MagSafe Wallet iPhoen 12 Pro Max 1 1" title="MagSafe-Wallet-iPhoen-12-Pro-Max-1-1.jpg" border="0" width="1000" height="563" /><strong>iPad</strong></p>
<p>When the iPad first came out I wanted one, but couldn’t get hold of one anywhere. It was months later before I got my hands on one as a Christmas present. I liked the idea of being able to play games with my kids on it and Lucie loved swiping around on the screen. This felt like the future to me, but it stayed very much a consumption device and the initial excitement faded into the background.</p>
<p>At the time I was hardcore into Android and had a long stream of new tablets to try out through my day job. I then didn’t pick up an iPad again until I moved into a new career and was handed an iPad Air as my main device. I didn’t really know what to do with it, but had to complete site visit reports on it so it also became my Laptop.</p>
<p>I poured over <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-2-review-why-the-ipad-became-my-main-computer/">guides from MacStories</a>, downloaded editorial guides and a year or so later began to lose hours of my life to the new hot thing that was Workflow. I bought a Logitech keyboard cases to go with it and never used anything else other than my iPad when I wasn’t sat at a desk. It became my computer a long time before Apple started marketing it as one, and before it came the new hotness to brag about on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>
<p>I began using a MacBook alongside an Android phone simply because Windows PCs became unappealing to me. When looking for a new laptop in a local electronics store I was encouraged to have a look at a MacBook. I am sure this was to try and upsell me something, but I was unimpressed with Windows 8 and really didn’t want to mess around with it any longer.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks I did some research and settled on a used MacBook Pro. I bought this through Facebook, and picked it up the next day. I have no idea what model it was but it was in incredible shape and did me proud. A few months later I picked up a new MacBook Air for a steal as it was being replaced by a new version. This was the old non-retina version and although great it didn’t quite live up to my old MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>About six months later I picked up a New MacBook Pro Retina on Boxing Day sales and my life with a Mac continued ever since. When I began podcasting a lot I picked up a second hand iMac from the head of our IT department and only upgraded this last year to an iMac Pro.</p>
<p>My journey into the Apple ecosystem has been a long one but an interesting one. The reverse of many other stories I have heard, as most then to start with an iPhone and go from there. I have considered trying to <a href="https://gr36.com/considering-jumping-the-walls/">jumping the walls</a> a few times in the past, but never manage it. The Apple Echo system just suits me, and its simply where I feel most at home.</p>

<p>Yeah, I’m <em>that</em> guy this year. I couldn’t decide which iPhone size I wanted, so I <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1327606056562925569?s=20">got them all</a>. It’s a weird position to be in but also provides me with some deeper insights into the real differences. I am not talking about specs and all those kinds of figures that people get too caught up in, the real things that make a difference to actually using the device. One of the strangest ones I have had to think about this year is the MagSafe wallet — so here is how it fits with each size iPhone.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="MagSafe-Wallet-iPhone-12-Mini-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dab53b524a.jpg" alt="MagSafe Wallet iPhone 12 Mini 1" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<h2>iPhone 12 Mini</h2>
<p>The smallest of the bunch is, somewhat understandably, the worst one regarding the MagSafe wallet. The iPhone 12 Mini is the same width as the wallet and the magnet position mean it goes all the way to the bottom of the phone also.</p>
<p>Meaning no margin for error, but a nice neat look and a perfect fit — in theory. In reality this means it’s the hardest to get on fully, and it’s also the easiest to move off the edge of the phone. The small size of the iPhone 12 Mini also means that it is the hardest to get off when you need to get a card out. Mainly because the only option you have is pushing it down from the top not side to side.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Magsafe-Wallet-iPhone-12-Pro-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/06439a696b.jpg" alt="Magsafe Wallet iPhone 12 Pro 1" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<h2>iPhone 12 Pro</h2>
<p>The best compromise in the sizes of iPhones is arguably the best size to use the MagSafe wallet with. When fitting the wallet you have some room around the phone to position the wallet securely if you don’t get it right straight away. Also some space on the back of the phone to remove the wallet easier when you need to get a card out.</p>
<p>It lacks the neatness of the iPhone 12 Mini, but doesn’t look too bad at all. I have also found that when using the MagSafe wallet on the back of your iPhone 12 Pro or iPhone 12, the phone is easier to hold. I feel much more comfortable using my phone out the house without a case when the wallet is attached enabling a bit more grip.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="MagSafe-Wallet-iPhoen-12-Pro-Max-2.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4adbbe06b7.jpg" alt="MagSafe Wallet iPhoen 12 Pro Max 2" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<h2>iPhone 12 Pro Max</h2>
<p>If you’ve read this far, you’re interested in what the MagSafe wallet is like with the biggest iPhone ever! The iPhone 12 Pro Max is humongous so there is no getting around that the wallet looks, well a bit weird!</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of room around the wallet, given the expansive slab of glass. It also moves around quite a bit when you are trying to use the phone, due to needing significant hand gymnastics. Quite often the MagSafe Wallet will move from side to side, and occasionally making me a little nervous!</p>
<p>The positive is that there is plenty of room for you to move the wallet to the correct position if you get it wrong. However, I would love to see a bigger version for the Pro Max simply so it doesn’t look so lost on the back of the phone.</p>
<p>MagSafe, especially the wallet, feels a little like version one so I am sure we will see revisions on future phones. Stronger magnets and better connections are a must as well as different sized accessories. However, the MagSafe wallet is a great addition to my fairly minimal lifestyle, so I’m pretty happy so far.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Three years ago I was <a href="https://gr36.com/the-amount-of-times-ive-missed-the-dual-camera/">dismissive of the zoom lens</a> that featured on the bigger versions of the iPhone. In part because I didn’t want a bigger phone, in part because the lens didn’t offer me much at that time, and there maybe me talking myself out of spending more money in there too.</p>
<p>Whilst many others, and Apple, have never been dismissive of the ability to get that little closer to your subject, they haven’t given it the attention it really needs. It terms of ability it often comes behind the main (or wide) lens, loosing quite a lot of detail. Although the telephoto lens is improved on the iPhone 12 Pro Max with a bigger sensor and wider ƒ/2.2 aperture, it still seems to lag behind the main sensor.</p>
<p>Yet in stark contrast to my thoughts a few years ago, I think the telephoto lens is used the vast majority of the time. Taping the 2x on the screen gets you a more representative image of what your eye is seeing (at 52 mm equivalent) and gets you closer to what you’re trying to shoot. In many situations it becomes the default.</p>
<p>Portraits, photos with a subject, information shots — in fact pretty much anything other than a landscape or group photo become the telephotos stomping ground. Yet the quality of the shots just don’t stand up to images on the wide lens. I am hoping Apple addresses this going forward, as they clearly see photography as being a huge selling point of the iPhone.</p>
<p>Perhaps next year we will see the larger sensor triple down to the smaller iPhone pro, and the pro max can push on even further by introducing lager sensors and better lenses. Using the iPhone 12 Pro Max for just short time has already proven handy to get a further 0.5x towards a subject I am trying to shoot.</p>

<p>I am currently trying, and failing quite a lot, to write my iPhone 12 review. Not because it isn’t an excellent phone, but it’s hard to review something that is basically the same as the old one. Cramming in 5g and changing the design to flat sides (why?) aside there is not a lot fundamentally changed. However, this has me thinking about a wider question of separating the iPhone from the iPhone Pro. What exactly is a Pro iPhone?</p>
<p>You tell your mum to buy an iPhone because it’s easy to use, you push the square you get the app. Yet dig a little deeper and you can delve into power features and now with iOS 14 actually start to customise your phone to whole new levels. The iPhone 12 Pro doesn’t change any of these interaction elements, which is both a good and a bad thing. It means that an iPhone feels like an iPhone. You’re using the same iPhone that you see in the hands of powerful people, but you’re also using the same iPhone as everyone else.</p>
<p>The Pro moniker appears to separate these two types of people now, creating a separate brand for those that like shiny things that are the best you can get in an iPhone package. Give those wanting something above and beyond the standard iPhone range, and also something to play into those that yearn for a status symbol. In the same way you see coffee shops littered with £2,000 macBook Pros for writing emails. A Pro for a Pro’s sake.</p>

<p>Despite ordering weeks ago, out of the blue my MagSafe Wallet turned up yesterday. I happily posted a picture on Twitter and all of a sudden quite a few people wanted to ask questions about it. So, I thought I might as well answer them all at once.</p>
<h2>How Many Cards Can You Fit In It?</h2>
<p>There is space for three cards to fit, that’s it. No more. However, the case is quite a snag fit so you won’t have any issues using one or to cards in there without them falling out.</p>
<p>There is also obviously no space for money, it’s very minimalist.</p>
<h2>What Colour Did You Get</h2>
<p>I opted for Baltic Blue, which pairs really well with the Pacific Blue iPhone 12 Pro I have, and also the Blue silicone case I occasionally use.</p>
<h2>How Strong Are The Magnets</h2>
<p>The real question we all wanted to know. The short answer is they will be fine. However, the longer one is, probably not as strong as they should be.</p>
<p>When in use I don’t think the wallet will slide off without you knowing about it, but it doesn’t sit nearly as solidly as the iPad Magic Keyboard. Particularly at the bottom it doesn’t take much force to move it around, and when using the phone you can feel it move around some times.</p>
<p>The reality is if you are not paying attention and wearing slim fitting trousers it may come off when you put your phone in your pocket. Using the wallet with a case adds a bit more friction, but I would like to see the address in a future update — I don’t think it is as secure as it should be.</p>

<h2>Can You Charge With It On?</h2>
<p>Nope, not at all, no wireless chargers work with the wallet attached. Not only it is probably too thick, but the wallet is shielded so you don’t ruin your cards, so nothing will get through anyway.</p>

<p>As soon as Apple showed off the iPhone 12 new design I was already dubious about how it would feel in the hand. Flat edges are great to look at, but there is a reason that no one uses them for modern smartphones. Put simply your hands are curved.</p>
<p>Sure the design of the iPhone 4/5 is lauded above all others, and the flat sides are part of that excellent design package, but this was at a time when screens and screen-time counts were much smaller. It still is a truly iconic design, but when your screen is 6.1inches and the phone weighs in at 183g it just doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, some people love the new design. Looking at it from afar it’s easy to see the huge change in design, and how great it looks. However, design has as much to do with function as it does form, and this just doesn’t work in your hand. The edges are uncomfortable, the weight is needlessly excessive, and it hurts my hands to use it.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am spoilt. After using the Pixel 5 and Note 20 ultra, they both feature a great feel it the hand. With the Pixel 5 sporting a similar 6inch screen in a much smaller, more ergonomic package that truly is a wonder to use. Sure it doesn’t feature the same types of materials, but high quality doesn’t mean great design. New users must take this into account when thinking about buying an iPhone 12 Pro especially.</p>
<p>I can understand why the change has been made. The iPad Pro, and new iPad Air, share a similar aesthetic and it’s important to reflect this in your line up. Without changing the design of the iPhone 12, what actually would have been updated from the iPhone 11? Growth at all costs leads to changes for changes sake, and you can claim that the flat design is <a href="https://om.co/2020/10/23/iphone-12-and-why-great-design-is-timeless/">”timeless iPhone design”</a> all you like. The fact remains that the iPhones design was curved for much longer than to was ever flat. For good reason.</p>
<p>The once notorious equal chin and forehead bezels with a round home button could be picked out in a crowed market. This iconic design has been replaced with the notched all screen display. Apple did not need to flatten the edges to make the iPhone stand out, it needed to work harder to build value to the design they have.</p>
<p>Perhaps the iPhone 12 mini will feel much better, perhaps it’s a non issue that people will get used to, and no doubt we will see loads of copycat designs now. However, right here, right now there is a reason other phones are not flat because they are designed to use not to look at. When all is said and done, a £1000 should feel better than this.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>A few times a year these kinds of posts start to appear. Around the time of installing new iOS updates, or getting a new phone, users start to think about what’s on their phone, and new people start to look for apps to use. Here are some of my favourite apps that are my first installs on any new phone.</p>
<h2>Pocketcasts</h2>
<p>I go backwards and forwards on podcast apps, but one that remains my favourite is <a href="https://www.pocketcasts.com/">Pocketcasts</a>. It works brilliantly across platforms, so I can still use it when testing <a href="https://gr36.com/pixel-5-review/">Android devices</a>, but also has a great macOS app and web player.</p>
<p>You’ll have to upgrade to get all the features, but that’s only £9.99 a year and includes a brilliant watchOS app that streams podcasts even better than the stock app. Oh, and it looks awesome too!</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2020/10/Image-1.png" alt="" /></figure>
<h2>Todoist</h2>
<p>Another staple of my daily usage is my task manager of choice, sure I have used others briefly, but it’s been on my device <a href="https://gr36.com/todoist-my-new-app-to-get-things-done/">for years now</a>. There are other apps that look prettier and perhaps have more in-depth customisation but to put it simply I can’t find any other app that can get your tasks from your brain into a plan quicker and easier. <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">Todoist</a> is also cross-platform and works petty much anywhere which is a huge bonus.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2020/10/Image-3-1.png" alt="" /></figure>
<h2>Dark Noise</h2>
<p>Now for something completely different, an app that provides most of my background sound. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">Dark Noise</a> is the app I turn to when working, it not only provides the best ambient sounds around but is also the best designed app I think I have ever seen! The developer <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc">Charlie</a> is all kinds of awesome too.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2020/10/Image-4-1.png" alt="" /></figure>
<h2>Headspace</h2>
<p>When I am not listening to podcasts, or ambient noise I spend at least 20 minutes every day meditating. Headspace is a popular choice for those wanting to work on their mindfulness, and for good reason as its packed full of features. You can get <a href="https://www.headspace.com/register">10 days free to try it out</a> too!</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2020/10/Image-5-1.png" alt="" /></figure>
<h2>Pocket</h2>
<p>Every year, when my subscription comes to an end, I try and find something better to use as a read it later service. Each year I fail. There are cheaper options, there are newer services but I simply can’t find anything better that captures all the text from articles and also surfaces posts about interesting topics. At £35 per year it’s not cheap, but you can use it completely free with a few customisations removed and also a few ads in your article feed.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2020/10/Image-6-1.png" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Honourable mention to <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, <a href="https://hey.com/">Hey email</a>, <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder 5</a> and <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a>. If I have missed something, don’t be shy let me know and <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36">recommend me your</a> favourite apps.</p>

<p>Every iPhone release time everyone starts focusing on the cameras in them. Loads of people go for photo walks and get great shots “with just a smartphone” and even more people start to question the role of a dedicated camera.</p>
<p>That’s because for more than 10 years the smartphone has cannibalised the point and shoot camera market. The reason Apple worked so hard on the original iPhone was because they knew people didn’t want to carry around a phone, iPod and camera, and even perhaps a PDA — and that is still true today.</p>
<p>The best camera is always the one you have with you, and its ability is very tailored to the type of images you are going to take, but also give you the flexibility to use it more in-depth. While phone cameras are great, I take the vast majority of my pictures on them, nothing beats a dedicated camera in my mind. Anything from a simple point and shoot to a DSLR camera will give you much better shots and enable you to do much more.</p>
<p>But the question really is, what do you want out of a camera, and most people just want a nice image they can lay a filter over and post to Instagram. Increasingly users are asking more and more from their cameras though, and the manufactures are needing to lean more and more on algorithms and computational processing to achieve things you can do easily with a dedicated camera.</p>
<p>There is more than a little bias here because I love my A7iii so much, but I don’t think an iPhone will ever get anywhere near even an entry-level Alpha shooter. Couple this with the ability to wonder around somewhere completely disconnected from the world and look for shots means a camera always wins for me.</p>

<p>My shiny thing arrived on Friday. The new iPhone 12 Pro was delivered really early in the morning, and within minutes started to fill me with the feelings that I knew it would. It feels pretty much the same as the last one, and also the one before that, bringing such tiny updates that if they hadn’t changed the edges to flat ones you’d be hard pushed to tell the difference. <em><a href="https://gr36.com/iphone-12-pro-thoughts/">Read more thoughts here</a></em></p>
<p>It doesn’t do anything new for me, apart from hurt my hands. Quite why Apple chose to move the design back to such an unergonomic one I will never know. Apple sold me a dream of owning a new thing that I really needed, but the effect too mere minutes to wear off. I have bought the new iPhone every year since the iPhone 6 and used them all the way through. Not because better phones don’t exist, but because iPhone suits me much better than anything else.</p>
<p>Undoubtably the iPhone 12 Pro is much better than anything else available, but I just don’t enjoy using it. I am not a ‘power user’ — which is a euphemism for use your phone far too much — so I do not need top of the line everything. For the last few months I have been using an iPhone SE as my ‘home’ phone and it is one of the best phones I have ever bought.</p>

<p>I write to you at the end of a horrible two weeks. Even in this position of privilege I have, my eyes have been opened simply by the fact I am not allowed to leave my house. In fact, if you read this on the day it is published, it is my last day inside, and I am just a few hours away from being able to leave the walls of my home — and what a privilege that will feel like.</p>
<p>Due to my father-in-law testing positive (and also being quite ill) we have had to self-isolate for 14 days due to close contact. They are part of our support bubble for Lucie and as such we could have contracted it too. I am glad to say we have been lucky to escape, my mother-in-law has not been so lucky, and everything is fine, but we went through our battle regardless.</p>
<p>Isolating is a weird thing to have to go through. On the surface if it, and indeed looking back at it, we will see that in the grand scheme of things it’s not hard. You have to stay in a place of infinite number of entertainment possibilities. It’s warm, safe and filled full of creature comforts. Simply because you can’t do that one thing, you realise how much you enjoy it.</p>
<p>The first few days are OK, you start to wonder why you wasted so much time with the big wide world when you can get so much done when staying in. DIY tasks are competed, jobs are done and things tidied up. Yet after a while it starts to drag, all I can think about is walking the dog with the wind in my face or the sun on my back. Enjoying the world, and doing nothing more than simply being outside. Tasks I need to complete cannot be done without a trip somewhere or another and the same walls become tiresome.</p>
<p>The garden just doesn’t cut it, I need space to walk and routes to take, I won’t do nearly as much as I could do but simply knowing I can, is comforting. I start to think about how much I go outside, and how much I value but take for granted about it. I think about the liberties that are taken away by those that can’t go out, either by punishment or circumstance and all the possibilities it brings. Many people go through much worse than I, and I am respectful of these situations, but it’s been hard and I don’t want to do it again!</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>It’s been three years since I used a Pixel device. Not since the first version was I even motivated to pick one up and try it out. They all excelled in specific areas, but always suffered from some frankly j<a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-2-xl-issues-so-far-813985/">aw-dropping issues</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/b7mp23/is_anyone_else_facing_major_ram_management_issues/">hardware omissions</a> — and when they somewhat sorted it all out with the Pixel 4 they wanted to charge premium prices and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-4-issues-1054820/">not deliver</a> on the premium part.</p>
<p>Something changed with the Pixel 5. Amid a pandemic Google began to focus on what they could do to bring a device together, and perhaps what their customers wanted. So instead of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-4-soli-motion-sense-1042448/">weird and wonderful</a> new developments they absolutely promise to develop, they took half a step back. Creating a device that leans on tried and tested hardware, not the bleeding edge. Just reliable specs, done well and priced at a point that Google felt it can complete.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://store.google.com/gb/product/pixel_5?gclid=CjwKCAjw0On8BRAgEiwAincsHNJ2zr7wBqvtHDfeD8bwGDEkvQWGWYE-tFkgIjoHNXlj6l2ERLyVKhoCKmoQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">£599 in the UK</a> (yay for no mmWave) it is a steal of a smartphone. Googles very own Android version, on hardware chosen to run it at peak optimisations — or at least thats what we are led to believe.</p>
<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br /><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8335452151565777" data-ad-slot="6575033860"></ins><br /><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>
<h2>Mid-tear Performance</h2>
<p>Despite there being loads of progress in this middle-top section (between £400-£800) the Pixel has an advantage that it is Googles flagship. So, it gets more development attention than many phones at this price point. While some companies cut things out to save costs and also not overshadow their top-tier handsets, Google can put in as much as they can for the price point they want to hit. While augments can be made that the Pixel 5 doesn’t have the bleeding edge of everything like other flagships, when you look at a phone such as the Note 20 Ultra, the Pixel 5 is half the price.</p>
<p>In actual use these supposed cuts are mostly nowhere to be found. The Snapdragon 765G provides more than enough power for every situation. Sure it isn’t as powerful as the 865, but who actually uses the power that these chips possess? I would challenge anyone that uses this phone to find any stutter or lag, or any situations where the thought of having a more powerful processor ever crops up. Even whilst gaming and editing images the phone never misses a beat — I am sure you could find lag somewhere that is caused directly by the processor but I have never seen it.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="hand-and-box-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/be3005a7e7.jpg" alt="Hand and box 1" width="1000" height="476" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>In fact, this ‘cut’ leads to battery life that is truly unbelievable. Let me say that again because it has never happened on a Google phone before — the battery life is insanely good. In fact, I can’t kill it! 8 hours screen on time is achievable, and some of my more leisurely days this week I got almost two days of use. Something helped by Googles option for a more reserved battery life processor, and no doubt software optimisations, squeezed every minute possible out of the 4080mAh battery.</p>
<p>Use it a lot I did because it is such a delight to use. The build quality feel, the ergonomic design and this hardware combination make a hard to resist package. Whilst the screen is a long way off the highest resolution on the market, its 6inch 1080 × 2340 (432 ppi) is one you won’t find major issues with, but it is very dim and the auto-brightness terribly slow.</p>
<p>Some slowdown or issues you may usually find in mid range hardware is smoothed out by the 90hz. Colours are natural and very pleasing to the eye, while text is sharp and the screen is all around absolutely fine to use. As we find with many of the choices made when building the Pixel 5, many words are written about the lack or this and that — but when you actually use it the phone, you realise what really matters.</p>
<p>There is no XL version this year, meaning that the Pixel 5 sits somewhere between the two, and with slim bezels and all metal build. In my opinion, this phone is the best feeling smartphone this year. The design may put some off as boring or utilitarian, but in a world on folding smartphones and weird innovations, Goole have carved out a simple but pleasing ‘candy bar’ smartphone that is both functional and still notably a Pixel.</p>
<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br /><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8335452151565777" data-ad-slot="6575033860"></ins><br /><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>
<p>The Sage colour I have is the only colour you should consider, the black version just doesn’t have the same appeal as the mottled green matte resin Google have covered the back in. This covering over the Aluminium body provides some rigidity to the design, meaning that wireless coils can be covered up, and the device always feel welcoming.</p>
<p>The design only broken by a slightly recessed fingerprint sensor, one that is fast and reliable and secure. It is a little strange to go back to rear mounted sensors after using more modern biometric options, but after a few moments it becomes smooth and natural, and you begin to wonder why things ever changed. Face unlock is fine, but this phone was designed in a pandemic, so you can understand the switch.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Camera-shot-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3efad4075a.jpg" alt="Camera shot 1" width="1000" height="504" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Since the very first version, Google put all its marketing and development into the Pixel Camera. It took top marks on DxOMarkMobile then, and has ranked very highly since then. The Pixel 5 continues this successful trend of doing more with less, and takes some truly amazing pictures. Its focus on black magic level image processing has led it to be lauded above many much more expensive phones and while it is still an extremely great camera, this year the sensor has really started to show its age.</p>
<p>Google definitely has its reasons, it couldn’t find another sensor to work very well with its processing algorithms, there is no avoiding the fact that newer more modern sensors are frankly much better. The 12MP IMX363 which first appeared on the Pixel 3, and is not far removed from the one on the Pixel 2, is now a long way behind larger higher quality sensors. While Google bridged the gaps with software in days past, the competition now takes as good, if not better shots.</p>
<p>With that said, the Camera is a delight to use — capturing images quickly and easily and achieving photos to be proud of in almost any situation. It punches well above it weight at only £599, and the edition of an ultra-wide lens makes it much more versatile.</p>
<p>The Pixel 5, as with those that have gone before it, excels in low light, and makes a mean portrait, but most of this is post-processing, so what you see in the preview window might not actually what the image turns out as. It also could be different again when you look at the photo on Google Photos later. Frankly that is usually a great thing, if a little baffling at first, and Google makes it easier to edit or revert changes made. Introducing a process of being able to change the angle of the light in portrait shots. Something that I feel only Google would do, and is amazing to play with, but ultimately, one of those features no-one uses.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Which brings us to a larger discussion about Google and Pixel version of Android. It’s a version that crops up nowhere else. A few that get close, but no-one does it as well. The Pixel always stays true to a Google vision of their OS, pushing features to it first, or sometimes exclusively to the Pixel Line.</p>
<p>This is one huge reason why the Pixel doesn’t need the top of the range processor because Android on the Pixel is nearly always fast and smooth. You get updates first, with Android 11 on board a long time before some are every shipping Android 10 to handsets. Google have also promised this for three years from release, so users will always be up to date — but what happens when Android isn’t optimised for this processor is anyone’s guess.</p>
<p>There are loads of software delights that you sometimes stubble on such as the power menu now highlighting compatible smart home gadgets and Google Pay cards. Unfortunately, my version does not feature the Google Assistant On Hold feature as it is US only, but does have <a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9158064?hl=en-GB">live transcribe</a> for any audio just a tap away at any point.</p>
<p>Google want Android to be as useful as possible while collecting data it can use to sell you things and companies adverts. We are all well are of that, and Android on the Pixel is the best possible version of that. You forgive the little quirks and the pestering for maps reviews because the OS is straightforward and a delight to use. Surfacing information, sending you notifications when you need them and being all around a great experience. There is nothing getting in the way on a Pixel, no third-party layers of options, not OEM themes. Just you and Google, and I like that.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="in-hand-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c372c782e2.jpg" alt="In hand 1" width="1000" height="450" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It’s easy to sum up a Pixel device. Good software, great camera and some compromises somewhere — but with the Pixel 5 they have found their hardware mojo. By actually stepping back and building a device for the current circumstances, they have made ultimately a better phone. No gimmicks, nothing new to learn, just tried and tested hardware all wrapped up in hardware that delivers.</p>
<p>I feel like my review is about a thousand words too short, but because we know what we are getting with Googles best the words have already been written. The Pixel 5 does open up a more interesting topic around the demand for keeping up to a specification race no-one needs, but when you pick up the device and use it all of that falls away.</p>
<p>You can point at this spec and that spec, but when you combine these things together in a Google package the Pixel 5 punches well above its weight. Although the camera shows its age, it’s still a delight to use and its software smarts sorts out shooting errors anyway. This is easily the best Pixel ever — and I wouldn’t recommend you buy anything else unless the few ‘cuts’ are things you simply can’t do without.</p>

<p>After using as many phones as I have over the last 12 months you begin to see things a little differently to just swopping your sim out once a year. While it’s easy to get complacent and just move to the next phone, I simply can’t do that and have to give each phone at least a couple of weeks try whatever my initial feelings are. Some I love and then fall away from quickly like the Galaxy Fold 2, some I love all the way through like the Note 20 Ultra, and some leave me perplexed from the very start.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my beloved iPhone does that to me this year, so I feel compelled to share some initial thoughts on the iPhone 12 Pro — but this is far from a review.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>There are no words I can say to sum up this design change that do anything other that tell you how much I hate it! I love the look of the square sides and am all for bringing the design in line with the iPad Pro because that also looks great. However, there is a reason every other thing you hold is as curved as possible, your hand doesn’t like it any other way.</p>
<p>I love the iPhone 5 design, its boxes neatness is one I still keep around in the form of an SE, and sometimes just look at it and appreciate it. Times have changed though, phones no longer feature 4-inch displays and weigh 113g. They contain 6.1” screens and are built of premium materials weighing 182g and frankly it hurts a little.</p>
<p>Granted it is early days, and things sometimes take a little getting used to but I really don’t like it at all. The boxy design looks great but functions terribly to a point where I don’t think I want to use it any longer. I can’t get behind a design that makes the phone feel much thinker than the iPhone 11 Pro, when in fact it isn’t!</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Rutland270920-5.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a460512c1f.jpg" alt="Rutland270920 5" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>Outside of this the iPhone 12 Pro retains everything else that is great about an iPhone. Featuring the same matt back that the iPhone 11 had, meaning that going caseless doesn’t mean you need a polishing rag with you at all times — at least not for the back. The Pacific Blue version I have has a polished band around the sides that is one of the hardest things to keep clean I have ever come across! The white iPhones have struggled with this issue much longer, but unfortunately, there is more surface area on the sides now, or they are easier to see, whatever the reason it’s a fingerprint magnet.</p>
<p>Battery life seems to be OK, sitting here on Wi-Fi 90% of the time, but is noticeably worse in current usage. It’s never going to run out on me given my more limited usage, but I am using it much more in this ‘getting to know you’ phase of my testing. Those venturing out and even more so when using 5G <em>may</em> have an issue on their hands, but we will see how this goes. I have noticed it getting hot a few times, so this may just be things settling down and syncing from the cloud still. I can’t see an issue with 6+hours of screen on time though.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Unfortunately due to being isolated, I haven’t had much chance to really try the camera out other than wandering around my house and snapping a few shots. In good light it is great, as was the iPhone 11 Pro, so this comes as little surprise. Images retain loads of detail, great dynamic range and the new HDR processing is a big leap forward.</p>
<p>In terms of the camera as a whole, this isn’t a huge improvement, but you are hardly going to get this given that last years iPhone 11 Pro is easily the best smartphone camera on the market. Others do well, with the Note 20 a delight to use, but the iPhone just gets it right so often with little work. The biggest improvement is in the fine detail captured, deep fusion works on all cameras this year and you can <em>really</em> see this at work.</p>
<p>The post-processing at work on the iPhone 12 Pro seems to take it easier than ever before. I don’t see nearly as much grain from iOS trying to lighten things up too much, and it keeps shadows much darker. I much prefer the look of the more natural colours in iOS photos, and I am glad to say nothing changes in this years phone — no weird skin smoothing either.</p>
<p>It is impossible for me to say for sure at this stage, but portrait shots seem much easier to shoot than ever before, no doubt helped by the LIDAR sensor. Night mode portraits are great unless there is too much backlight, but only work with the wide sense and not the usual 2x.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am conflicted. I have bought the new iPhone every year since the iPhone 6 and used them all the way through. Not because better phones don’t exist, but because iPhone suits me much better than anything else. I am not a ‘power user’ which is a euphemism for use your phone far too much, so I do not need top of the line everything. For the last few months I have been using an iPhone SE as my ‘home’ phone and it is one of the best phones I have ever bought.</p>
<p>Undoubtably the iPhone 12 Pro is much better than anything else available, but I just don’t enjoy using it. The camera is indeed great, but it was great last year too. I am so disappointed by the feel of the phone in my hand that I am considering returning it pretty much straight away. The only thing stopping me is my desire to give the phone real usage, and my thoughts may change…perhaps.</p>

     <p>One of the proximal causes of the COVID-19 issues here in the UK has been a dramatic reduction in my podcast listening.

<p>I whole heartedly agree with that statement.

It’s not faultless but it’s just so easy to use that you want to take photos with it.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>I have only written very briefly about my rapid adoption of Roam Research to dump all of my <em>stuff</em> into. In depth words are hard for me to sum up, I struggle to even bring together an outline of how I use it, simply because it is so flexible and powerful. I use it for everything from meeting notes to journalling, I put almost everything that I think about in here to form my second brain.</p>
<p>This is a widely used term to describe the process of loading everything to another place. Most people associate this with a note app, but it doesn’t have to be digital at all, it can simply be a notebook or task manager. I have tried this several times, and adopted Evernote and Apple Notes at different points in my life. Although they are both great apps, I could never access the information when I wanted to — or even better, when I wasn’t even aware I needed to.</p>
<p>By building out my second brain on Roam I can link together ideas that come from many places and piece them all together with ease. Of the notes apps I have tried, they make the process of storing and retrieving them liner by nature, whereas by using a bi-directional linking model, as Nat Eliason <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam">puts it</a>, Roam allows “notes live nowhere and everywhere”.</p>
<p>New notes are created with minimal interaction, and because of the powerful underlying technology, ideas start to come together without any interaction from me. It only gets more useful the more information you put into it, linking together words and phrases that surface when I need them to. It is a strange system to get use to, and an expensive one to buy into, but it has already proven its worth for all aspects of my life and I truly can never go back.</p>

<p>When I sit down and think about doing a review, I want to answer the questions I would have about using a device. I think about the unique things that make this phone worth while, and the things I need answering in order to buy one. When it comes to the Galaxy Note line of handsets it is becoming harder and harder to differentiate them past a stylus – but there’s actually a lot to look at in my Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra review.</p>
<p>I realise that I am doing these two phones in the wrong order. Before the <a href="https://gr36.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-5g-review/">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a> came the Note 20 Ultra. But given how different the Fold is to use, arguably the better device sat in the side lines and waited its turn. I always give these phone a good use, I’m not one of these people the spends a day with a second sim in a phone and moves on, I’ve been using the Note 20 Ultra as my only phone for a few weeks now and I have to say I’m impressed.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-note20/buy/?cid=UK_PPC_3998554642_FF~Eval:Brand%2BProd_Note20_KS~BAP_BS~IM_PR~SMART_SB~NOTE20_OB~TRAFFIC_PK~QualityVisits_FS~LHQ_MD~W_AI~N_MT~EXA_CA~KEW_paid-cdm&gclid=Cj0KCQjw5eX7BRDQARIsAMhYLP8VVxJm9UE_MLiih9quGSRkp59_M4HmG9tKBgtP-k9yUY3W-tz2Ra8aArldEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">Note 20 line up</a>, although confusing, is one of the most interesting advances in this line for quite a while. This line topping Ultra model packs all the top of the line specs you’d expect and also expands on new technology first seen in the Galaxy S20 Ultra. This phone has been taken to a point where it is almost perfect on paper in every way, and although paper doesn’t always tell the tale of a smartphone, the premium nature of the Note 20 Ultra is apparent straight away.</p>
<p>Topping the scales at a mere 208 grams, it is surprisingly light for a device sporting a 6.9inch screen. Although it doesn’t feel <em>light</em> in any way, it is only 50g heavier than an iPhone SE that is a small portion of the size. Every inch of the phone feels premium and well made, with the matte backed Mystic Bronze version I have only adding to the appeal of such a premium smartphone experience. Its boxy, thin, glass and metal design carries on the same signature features as the phones before it but takes a step up in quality and finish.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/959ac341d7.jpg" alt="Note 20 Ultra" title="Note-20-Ultra.jpg" border="0" width="1600" height="900" /></p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Unfortunately we can’t go much further into talking about handling the phone without talking about that huge camera bump. It is ridiculous whichever way you look at it, a design choice that should be inexcusable. Not being afraid of the camera bump is one thing, but not designing it into the back of your phone is another. It makes the device slightly top heavy when holding, wobble when on a table, and also affects some stand up wireless chargers – so be fair warned the design choice does affect more than it looking a bit ugly.</p>
<p>With all that said I would live with the monstrous bump to get the camera it has inside it. The three camera set up is a delight to use, and gets some amazing results. I have never been the biggest fan of Samsung cameras, but this time I am blown away by the improvements. It might be the new 108mp main camera, it could be the assisted laser focus that removes much of the focus hunting plaguing the S20 Ultra. Or it could be Samsung’s improved processing of images. All of these things combine to make a camera that for once is a genuine competitor to iPhone shooters.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3f266e2fbf.jpg" alt="Rutland270920 2 1" title="Rutland270920-2-1.jpg" border="0" width="2000" height="1333" /></p>
<p>Not because phones before it got bad results, but because you no longer have to work for it. I have very little need to go into pro mode unless I want a specific look from my images, I can confidently point and shoot and get great results almost all of the time. Unless you play about with the setting the main camera takes snaps with the 108mp camera and then uses “nona-binning, pixel binning by a factor of nine” meaning your images retain loads of detail but don’t take up a huge amount of room on you phone. Making them much easier to share with people and social media.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> opt to take images at the full resolution with a few taps, but there are very few reasons to do so. The main sensor is flanked by two 12mp sensors, one f2.2 ultra wide and one f3.0 telephoto. Each one giving the excellent results we expect from Samsung cameras, I particularly enjoy shooting with the ultra wide due to its 120 degree field of view.</p>
<p>Sure there are some instances in low light that grain creeps in, and sometimes it has a tendency to over expose, but 99/100 you are going to get a shot you are happy with. One word of warning though, the zoom can be a little fiddly and sometimes takes a few moments to realise which lens it should be using. In fact in anything other than good light, a zoomed photo will be using a cropped in version taken on the main camera lens and not the telephoto at all – but you will get great results regardless.</p>
<p>With regards the the 50x zoom, it’s usable but wont come in handy very often, whereas the 10x and even in some situations the 20x still gives out nice results and keeps plenty of detail in the shot.</p>

<h2>Screen</h2>
<p>As with every large screened phone, the in-camera experience allows for many more controls to be packed onto the screen, and still leave a large view finder. The 6.9″ edge Quad HD+ Dynamic screen is capable of 3088×1440 (496ppi) and 120hz refresh rate — but not at the same time.</p>
<p>This is frustrating to say the least, however I opted for the higher refresh rate of the two choices and suffer no ill effects. The screen is still pin sharp at FHD, vibrant and colour rich to make images and text really stand out.</p>
<p>Can we spare a moment to talk about these curved screens that Samsung keep insisting on producing. I am not sure they have ever been a good idea, and although the software does an ok job of rejecting unintended touches, it makes the phone much harder to grip onto. I simply <em>have</em> to use a case when using the Note 20 Ultra outside for fear of dropping it. Leading it to invariably shatter into a million pieces given its almost entirely glass construction.</p>
<p>The factory applied screen protector is frankly garbage. It has already started to gather dust around the top of my screen, and retains prints like it’s trying to collect them all. It should be one of the first things you replace if you don’t want to be polishing your phone all the time. Thankfully the Mystic Bronze version at least fends them off on the back, but if you opt for Mystic Black version it can get very annoying very quickly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1f87da38c4.jpg" alt="Rutland270920 4 1" title="Rutland270920-4-1.jpg" border="0" width="1000" height="563" /><br />
It is finished in Corning’s latest Gorilla Glass Victus, so should stand up to most things, but remove the screen protector at your own risk.</p>
<h2>Finger Print Sensor</h2>
<p>A criticism of the finger print sensors speed and accuracy posed by most reviews thankfully has been unproven in most cases. Although after a couple of weeks of use it is for some reason much slower, requiring me to record my prints again to improve results. The under screen sensor is a little strange to get used to, I am never quite sure where to place my finger on the screen, and I would much prefer one on the back with a tactile place to highlight where to put it. With that said it is light years easier than putting in on the side of the phone, and I combine this <em>with</em> face unlock to mean that the device is usually unlocked before I realise it.</p>
<p>Thankfully the Note 20 Ultra doesn’t blow past the lock screen once authenticated like phones of old, making interacting with the device much easier and very rarely needing to see the home screen if receiving a notification.</p>
<h2>Battery Life</h2>
<p>This is not something I usually have to call out specifically in a modern phone review. Usually a few passing remarks are enough to pitch this in the realms of all day battery life. However this version of the Note 20 I have, the UK Exynos version, is frankly rubbish.</p>
<p>In the first few days of usage I struggled to get 4 hours screen on time. Opting to leave everything as is out of the box and opting for 120hz refresh rate, and reaching for the charger a long time before I should be doing. When really digging into the setting and putting apps to sleep when you don’t need them etc 4 hours is achievable, but I frankly refuse to have to start turning off location, Bluetooth etc just to get good battery life.</p>
<p>Samsungs insistence to use their own processors in phones is inhibiting the experience for users, and when the Snapdragon version can see more than 90minute more SOT than this version it is frankly unacceptable. The experience of your device shouldn’t be limited by where you live, and I hope this is addressed very quickly. Galaxy Notes are usually known for their battery life, but this falls well short of the mark currently — bordering on completely unacceptable.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5c7c9485c0.jpg" alt="Note 20 Ultra 3 1" title="Note-20-Ultra-3-1.jpg" border="0" width="1000" height="563" /></p>
<p>I have watched countless hours of videos claiming to have a set up that will improve my battery life, I have contacted Samsung who refuse to admit there is an issue. The fact remains the battery life is shockingly bad given the 4500 mAh capacity. Supporting fast charging of 25w and wireless of 15w is no replacement for battery life optimisations done in production.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>I can almost copy and paste my experience with Samsung from any other phone I have used from them in the last couple of years. The Note 20 Ultra features Android 10 and has Samsungs One UI 2.5 on top of this to add in additional features. I might be looked at a bit funny for saying this, but I really like ONEUI now it has matured a little. Of all the skins Samsung have done the best job in redefining what Android feels like, but also retain its charm and underlying features.</p>
<p>The tie with Microsoft again runs very deep with OneUI, and features almost every Google service matched, by not only a Samsung version, but also now a Microsoft version. A promised update later in the year with further attempt to solidify that partnership with task and note syncing between the two companies. Something that those tied into Office 365 will look at very seriously.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for Samsung, some things still fall short and get frustrating in parts. The Software is still bloated with advert and notifications to use new features. You’re never quite sure if to update the app in Samsung Store or Google Play, and weirdness continues throughout the OS. The most frustrating of all is syncing a Microsoft 365 calendar to the stock Samsung app just gets you stuck in an endless loop. You must install the Samsung email to enable sync, yet are encouraged to use Outlook.</p>
<p><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8335452151565777" data-ad-slot="6575033860"></ins></p>
<p>I am almost at the stage where I wish Samsung would just ditch Android and produce their own OS. They are stuck in this three-way pull between themselves, Google and Microsoft, leaving the end user slightly confused at what to use. Yet outside of this almost expected weirdness the OS is light, fast, and a pleasure to use.</p>
<h3>Muti-tasking</h3>
<p>One of the biggest improvements made to the new devices is the ability to multitask more easily. Much like the Galaxy Fold 2, you can create app pairing stored in the side bar for easy opening of your most used pairings. Although only limited to top and bottom split, using the phone in landscape does allow for quite a lot of information to be displayed thanks to that big screen, so comes in more useful than you might think.</p>
<p>Of course option exist for floating windows, pinned notes on the screen and all manor of options to get things done. What this really shows is the sheer ability of both the OS and the underlying hardware to multitask with minimal effort. You can have 2 or 3 pretty intensive apps open at a time and never see the Note 20 Ultra miss a beat.</p>
<p>I would love to see drag and drop implemented into more apps, and Samsung work more closely with the Office team to allow for dragging over documents into email for example. I get the feeling this may be coming in future version, as Microsoft are already onboard with integrating services and also allowing for S Pen usage in more apps.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/68a03b18e6.jpg" alt="Rutland270920 1 1" title="Rutland270920-1-1.jpg" border="0" width="1000" height="563" /></p>
<h2>S Pen</h2>
<p>It could be said that this is one of the major selling points of owning a Note series phone. When in practice I am never sure how many people use it sparingly and only for very few functions. Most long term users talk about never taking it out after the first month, so usefulness is clearly subjective.</p>
<p>How many people are writing notes on their screen, colouring in or annotating Pdf document remains to be seen. I do do all of those things, but my most used interaction with the S Pen is to allow another interaction element to exist.</p>
<p>Not only does the S Pen allow for much more accurate interaction with apps — Samsung have reduced latency from 45ms down to 9ms — it also allows for different options when in use. I can scrub through video with my finger but trim the start and end points with the S Pen. I can draw on an image while selecting elements with my finger, and any number of app interactions. I am already well onboard with a <a href="https://gr36.com/spen-stylus-interaction/">stylus as a separate interaction element</a>, but the Note 20 proves to me that Samsung got this dead right by sticking with the included S Pen.</p>
<p>The real beauty is, if you don’t want to use it, you never have to pop it out of the bottom of the device ever again. I mean who actually uses it to take photos or wave it around like some kind of magic spell to go backwards on a web page.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I have used every version of the note line to date, bar the exploding one and the weird one that never launched in the UK. Some are great, some mediocre. The Note 20 Ultra hits every mark you want it to, bar battery life, it is a premium smartphone that feels like it’s worth very penny of the £1200 you pay for it. Those that use it will feel like they are using the best phone on the market, it seemingly does everything, has a huge gorgeous screen and packs a top of the line camera.</p>
<p>It’s hard to find downsides to the Galaxy Note Ultra — but then I shouldn’t be able to for this price. No words seem to quite get anywhere to summing it up other than, it’s great. When all phones are now the size of the Note line it’s hard to find a major differentiator other than an S Pen. If Samsung phones are your thing, you are getting a more refined version of the S20 in the Note 20 — one you wont be disappointed with.</p>

<p>Following on from a great post by Jeff Perry about the <a href="https://tablethabit.substack.com/p/look-at-the-engine-not-the-color?r=4l3mj&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=copy">unimportant things we worry abut when choosing a note taking app</a>. I wanted to expand on this slightly. The way you take notes and the access you have to them afterwards is infinitely more important than the app you use to collect them.</p>
<p>You can have the best, most expensive note taking app in the world, but if you don’t have a system for collecting your thoughts and being able to refer to them easily then it doesn’t make a bid bit of difference. Time and the again I fall for a new app that is going to improve my ability to do <em>X</em> better — and that is emails apps, note apps, task managers — when in reality all I need to do is keep doing the thing.</p>
<p>On the flip-side of this, I have been using Roam Research for quite a while now, and it allows me to dump ridiculous amount of information with almost zero separation and leave it to form its relationships. This can be done in other services, including a <a href="https://www.notion.so/notion/Link-to-pages-blocks-cb3c406403c940b68af52de121e05474?utm_campaign=2.9+Release+Email+-+Personal&amp;utm_content=2.9+Release+Email+-+Personal&amp;utm_medium=email_action&amp;utm_source=email">recent update to Notion</a>, but the system I have works tremendously well for me.</p>

<p>After frequenting the Galaxy Fold owners forums and subreddits, one of the biggest and most asked questions is in relation to Samsungs new colour ‘Mystic Bronze’. Whilst it sounds all mysterious with the marketing panache of Apple’s colours — what people really want to know is if it is pink, and if so how pink is it really.</p><p>This is a difficult question to answer. Not because there isn’t enough of them about, there are loads of hands on videos and review of both the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and also the <a href="https://youtu.be/RC1ICxIsr7Y">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a> — with Samsung providing Mystic Bronze to every reviewer. More so because there is a lot to take into account when deciding on a colour as complex as this one.</p><p>Much like the new Midnight Green colour that the<a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone-11-pro/"> iPhone 11 Pro</a> comes in, Mystic Bronze looks different in different lights. Its matte texture adds to the colour shift and in many instances it appears very bronze coloured. Looking straight on at the phone you would be hard pushed to call the colour anything other than a muted bronze. However when you look at the phone in your hand, the camera bump, rings around the camera sensors and also the top and bottom edges have a much more Pink hue to them.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/8ea258dd0d.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Note 20 Ultra 2 2" loading="lazy" title="Note-20-Ultra-2-2.jpg" /></figure><p>It is only when you place the phone next to contrasting colours such as dark jeans or a dark desk, that you really see the pink hue come to life. In comparison to something that is actually <em>is</em> bronze coloured there is really no comparison to the colour. While this defiantly isn’t rose gold, its not bronze either.</p><h2 id="adding-a-case">Adding A Case</h2><p>You’d think that this could be mediated by putting a case on your phone, and while that is a great idea in principle it actually adds to the Pink colour. By isolating the Camera unit the phone takes on more of a pink vibe and may make some people even more unhappy. So bare this in mind if you are thinking about getting this colour.<br /></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/b484fe2132.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Note 20 Ultra 1 1" loading="lazy" title="Note-20-Ultra-1-1.jpg" /></figure><p>Personally I think this colour is great and those that go for it will be very happy with its overall finish and it’s resistance to finger prints. However bear in mind that this phone defiantly is pinkish.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>About 10 months ago, I was invited down by Samsung KX to have a few hours hands on with their first folding phone. Mere months after it had been recalled due to major issues with the device, it was back with a bang, and already picking up quite a following. The appeal of having a tablet folded up in your pocket had a much larger pull than the £1500 price tag, as was <a href="https://gr36.com/advance-tech-exciting/">the exciting move forward in technology</a> that Samsung had been teasing for years.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1mVtJ4oVhQ&feature=emb_title">really liking the phone</a>, it wasn’t ready for me to splash my own cash on it, there were far too many compromises with handset for me to bear. Fast-forward to now as the second version goes on sale, with many of the first versions issues fixed — but with a hefty price increase. Has Samsung done enough to justify the £1800 ($2000) price tag?</p>
<h2>Premium Feel</h2>
<p>There are lots of people that get annoyed when you talk about the price of the Galaxy Z Fold 2 in reviews. They think that this shouldn’t be brought into it as there is nothing that lives up to the Folds usability. While this true, it is impossible to escape the £1800 price tag and the expectations it brings with it. You expect a premium smartphone with top of the line specs — and that is exactly what you get from the handset. In the hand it feels nothing short of magical, the weight (282g) is impossible to describe as anything else but heavy, but in the hand it is balanced perfectly.</p>
<p>Especially folded, the unit sinks into your hand with a reassuring heft. Samsung have done some great engineering to get all the technology in this size package, but you feel the weight every time you use it. There are no creaks or cracks from this Uber Smartphone, so the engineering needs some special appreciation when compared to others on the market.</p>
<p>Samsung have developed the hinge much further forward when compared to last years unit, and taken over much of the function from <a href="https://gr36.com/48-hours-galaxy-z-flip/">the Z Flip</a>. Four CAM hinges allow the phone to be oped to whichever angle you wish, and provides more resistance to opening to allow more usability. Combined with a sweeper system to remove dust from the hinge should mean that this unit resists the issues plaguing the first attempt, and certainly those still using the Z Flip support this claim.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/86727f19a4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></p>
<p>This re-engineered hinge further adds to the premium feel for the Galaxy Z Fold 2, where every part of the hardware feels thought through and designed to exude a certain type of extravagant image. As <a href="https://youtu.be/fQ3ReOb85ac?t=589">Flossy Carter says</a>, you are going to see lots of images of these on tables surrounded by glasses of Cristal. There is a certain exuberance to the Galaxy Fold 2, and lots of flexing going on simply because it delivers on it premium price tag.</p>
<h2>Screens</h2>
<p>Perhaps the number one complaint against the first version of the Galaxy Fold was the tiny cover screen. While perfectly useful for notification triaging, on a device so futuristic it felt out of place. So, understandably this is the first thing that is immediately obvious when using the Fold 2. The cover screen now fills almost the entirety of the front of the phone minus a small hole punch camera cut out.</p>
<p>At 6.2” (2260×816 – 386ppi – 60hz ) the cover screen is now more usable, and even if a bit narrow to type on, is perfect for quick tasks or responding to notifications. Enabling swiping on the keyboard makes interacting with the keyboard at bit easier, but this is not to say it is impossible. The tall, narrow screen is perfectly suited to scrolling through emails or social media. Using the cover screen grows on you more than the last version ever did, and I found myself interacting with it much more than I thought I would.</p>
<p><img title="Z-Fold-2-Review-06-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d7fab7f4ad.jpg" alt="Z Fold 2 Review 06 1" width="450" height="600" border="0" /></p>
<p>However, why have a huge screen and not use it, open up the fold and the beauty of the screen is a wonder to behold. Samsung have done away with the huge notch from the first version as well as boosting the size and refresh rate (2208×1768 – 373ppi – 120hz). Dubbed the ‘Infinity Flex’ display, it goes closer to the edge now, encompassing the whole of the device, bar Samsungs signature hold punch.</p>
<p>Apps in use on the cover screen carry over to the inside screen (bar a little bit of weirdness from some), to give you something truly immersive. When using the inner screen it feels like you are moving pixels around the screen. The adaptive display varies refresh rate from 11zh all the way up to 120hz, meaning that no matter that you are doing you will get great battery life and also a smooth scrolling experience. The Jelly scroll that the original fold suffered from is not completely removed but almost impossible to spot.</p>
<p>It’s hard to find a downside to this gorgeous display, games look great, reading is brilliant and videos immersive. When open the device feels balanced and perfectly poised in your hand for media consumption, and many users will see little reason to use anything else for all of their needs. The inner display is truly why you would buy the Galaxy fold, and this version truly delivers.</p>
<p>Of course there is one, the screen has a crease in the middle that is hard to avoid. Much like any other foldable, you can feel it in usage, you can see it in some instances but not every one. The great thing is that it does not take away anything when you are using the device, it doesn’t stick out and in fact soon fades into the background like a notched screen, or the camera hole punch.</p>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>So, you want to actually use the thing right? Well all of that reassuring weight we have spoken about, it’s also going to affect it in your pocket and in your hand. There is no getting away from this phone/tablet hybrid being heavy. I found myself struggling to hold it up when open, and resorted to using both hands most of the time — but that’s the point right.</p>
<p>In this heavy package you get two screens, and battery life that will get you loads of screen onetime if you use the larger screen most of the time — and considerably more if you use the outer screen more. Even in the first week of me using the Fold 2 and playing with it what felt like constantly, I would still be at more than 25% when going to bed. You should comfortably be able to get 6hours of screen on time and still have battery left over, which is amazing results considering battery life should also get better as the OS analyses my usage and improves things. If the next model slims things down, I would hope that battery life stays as good as it is because an increase in weight is worth it.</p>
<p>You can’t expect a Galaxy fold to be as light as a regular phone can you, this is simply the trade off with wanting and using one of these devices. While something like the Z flip balances the reassuring weight without feeling clumsy, the Z Fold feels a little unwieldy when out and about. Bending the phone slightly helps to fit it better in your hand, but obviously adds a little distortion to the screen.</p>
<p><img title="Z-Fold-2-Review-08-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ce633d6733.jpg" alt="Z Fold 2 Review 08 1" /></p>
<h3>Flex Mode</h3>
<p>Expanding on the special mode introduced with the Z Flip, the Z Fold 2 allows apps to take advantage of a partially folded state. As an example Youtube in Flex mode shows a video on the top half of the screen, allowing you to interact with the comments on the bottom half. Google Duo also supports this as does the native camera app.</p>
<p>The limited nature of this and the lack of visual clues means you may spend a bit of time experimenting to find out what does and doesn’t support it — and often this is more no than yes. I am yet to find any reason to use it outside of novelty, especially given the lack of people actually using Google Duo. I wouldn’t go out of my way to encourage others to use it, just so I can flex my phone.</p>
<p>More often that not, a partial flexed form is used simply to enable me to set my phone down and still watch a video, or prop it up to keep an eye on the time. As app developers update apps we <em>might</em> see some more innovative use of flex mode, but given the lack of support so far I wouldn’t hold my breath.</p>
<h3>Tablet Mode</h3>
<p>Which leads me into another issue with app support, and the lack of tablet layout from apps. It could be the weird aspect ratio, it could be Android apps as a whole, but many apps make little use of the bigger screen.</p>
<p>Apps like Outlook are a delight to use, and offer different layouts and view options, but most just put more content on the screen with no options to increase text size or improve readability. Samsung does offers options in settings to choose between blowing the app up or trying to force more content. Combined with further options in Samsungs own <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock-2020">Goodlock app</a>, you can tune most things to work, but it takes a considerable amount of work.</p>
<h3>Muti-Tasking Master</h3>
<p>All these words can be ignored if you want the biggest screen possible on a smartphone to do your ‘stuff’. If you need a device to work on the go, consume loads of media, or just want to blow everything up as large as possible you’ll put up with all the downsides.</p>
<p>Samsung have put in a great deal of work to make the Fold 2 take advantage of the large inner screen and make it as useful as possible. It is a delight to use two apps side by side when multi taking. Having email and calendar up on the screen while talking on the phone, or simply watching YouTube while texting is quite frankly a transformative experience. Sure you can do that on a tablet, but you can’t then fold it up and put it in your pocket. If being productive on the go is your bag, then this needs to be your phone.</p>
<p>I am on the fence about how usable Flex mode is, but the amazing app pairing done by OneUI is something that you may struggle to live without. Other phones such as the Note20 Ultra do this as well, but nowhere near on the same level.</p>
<p><img title="Z-Fold-2-Review-05-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5e6851d313.jpg" alt="Z Fold 2 Review 05 1" /></p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 2 runs on Android 10 and has Samsungs One UI 2.5 on top of this to add in additional features. It comes bundled with the expected Google services but also several Microsoft ones baked in, such as syncing your photos to OneDrive. There is very little to say about Android nowadays, as it functions exactly as expected and is intuitive to use. The tie with Microsoft is due to get stronger with improvements to note and reminders syncing with MS products as they take aim at productivity customers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for Samsung, they seem to never really get services 100% correct. Photo sync only works with a Microsoft account, not a Microsoft 365 account which is frankly bizarre. A Microsoft 365 calendar does not sync to the stock calendar unless you instal the Samsung email app, yet you are encouraged to use Outlook.</p>
<p>Samsung does provide, in my opinion, the best extension or ‘skin’ on Android around today. Samsung’s design and user experience are often a delight to use. They have really thought about a modern design that doesn’t deviate too far from stock Android design, but offers something uniquely Samsung. Of course that is a subject view point, but since OneUI was introduced the design and implementation of their software has improved dramatically.</p>
<p>I just wish Samsung didn’t feel the need to fill their apps full of adverts, or useless information at every turn. Even the default weather app has news articles and rubbish crammed in it for no good reason. I know it takes very little to change these apps to others, I just don’t expect to see these kinds of things in default apps on an £1800 phone. Some users have already reported adverts and the usual shady tactics by Samsung, something that needs to be fixed if they want to be taken seriously.</p>
<h3>Changes to your life</h3>
<p>When you adopt the Fold 2 it changes the way you use your phone. Both in a positive and a negative way. The large screen allows you to do things that you simply can’t any other phone, it provides something that only the Z Fold can provide. It is in essence a folding tablet, and there are adjustments you will have to make to the way you use it.</p>
<p>Taking out the Fold 2 and walking around gives you a level of anxiety that nothing else has given me. The slippery body and high price tag make me nervous every time my phone makes a noise. There are already reports of some dropages, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/iuwzkj/welp/">it seems to hold up pretty well</a>, but the lack of cases and expected large repair bills leave me worried, and I am not the only one. Due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/16/21139897/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-ultra-thin-glass-durability-scratch-test-jerryrigeverything">longevity worries on the UTG screen</a> and no IP rating, users are worried <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/iw71es/im_scared_to_clean_the_inner_screen_protector/">even about cleaning the device correctly</a>.</p>
<p>The inner screen still has a tendency to scratch easily, and you’ll need to take some extra care. You won’t be using this at the beach, or throwing it into the bottom of a bag, but if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-Gt4GpEgyU">long-time users of other foldable phones</a> are anything to go by it should hold up ok. It is just another thing you need to think about when choosing a device like this.</p>
<p>I have to treat this phone with an extra amount of care, and in some instances change the way I use it. Which is what a foldable device dictates, you are carrying around a huge screen in your pocket and as such you’ll be opening it as much as possible to really take advantage. The screen draws you in and makes many tasks much easier, such as typing out a long email on the split keyboard.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>If there is anything I can point the finger at that is simply not good enough it is the camera. There is nothing inherently wrong with the shooter, but at this super flagship price point it is simply not good enough.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> get some good shots from it, but be prepared to work for them and chuck 30–40% of them in the bin. In good light you are going to be happy with almost everything you take, despite not holding the most amount of detail they could, shots are bright and as with all Samsung images retain a vibrant saturation. In any other situation they are grainy, washed out and suffer from some kind of strange skin smoothing effort despite the option being switched off.</p>
<p>When trying to discus this with others that have the phone you are told to use Pro mode and do this and that, or simply blamed for the results. While it great that these options exist for you to have control over the image you take, I don’t feel you should <em>have</em> to do this is take a good shot. Undoubtedly the Galaxy Z Fold 2 gets the job done but when great cameras like the iPhone 11, Pixel 4 and OnePlus 8 take images with zero input, this camera falls well short of what I expect.</p>
<p><img title="Z-Fold-2-Review-09-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1a2f67389b.jpg" alt="Z Fold 2 Review 09 1" /></p>
<p>There are other things you get with this phones camera that no one else provides. The huge screen is the best view finder possible, even if it does feel like you’re one of those people that takes pictures with a tablet. As well as the software ‘flex mode’ allowing you to set the phone down half flexed to stabilise your image, or simply view images you have snapped in the bottom half. Bear in mind though you have to place the phone down on its screen to do this.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While I would stop short of recommending this phone to others because of cost and the ways in which you need to change the way you use your phone, for a certain type of user this is going to be invaluable. It provides something to no other device on the market can provide, not just in the way it works, but the way it makes you feel. You feel as though you are using a little slice of the future and getting something out of your phone that no-one else does.</p>
<p>I can somewhat forgive the camera because I am getting a folding device that immerses me into whatever I want to do. You can play games, multi-task and consume media on this like no other device can and that speaks volumes. I love the Galaxy Z Fold 2 because it has that little something about it, it’s not the best at everything but it provides something unique and does it brilliantly.</p>
<p>If you really want a folding tablet, then look no further than this model. It fixes all the issues from the first one and puts them in a premium package that feels worth very bit of the price you are paying. But let’s be clear, to buy the Galaxy Z Fold 2 you need to really <em>want</em> a folding tablet because you will pay for it. Both in the high price tag and also in the caveats of having such a large device.</p>
<p>It comes down to do the advantages of having such a large screen to use, out weigh the downsides of carrying it around on your pocket all the time. For me, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 feels like wearing your winter coat all year because it is cold half the time, but for others this is going to be a game changer.</p>

<p>After picking through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/16/21437942/social-dilemma-netflix-review-orlowski-sarah-zhang-memo-facebook-buzzfeed">Casey Newtons pick apart</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0">The Social Dilemma</a> I then fell on the linked post by Adi — and despite disagreeing on some major points throughout both posts — I found an interesting topic I had not considered. Where exactly does Whatsapp fall into these issues?</p>
<p>You can jump up and down about algorithms and Facebooks willingness to manipulate engagement. You can worry about Mr Zuckerbergs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/facebook-trump-free-speech.html">free spech bubble</a> all you like, but the simple fact is Whatsapp doesnt have any of these inputs, but is a top contender for spreading Fake News.</p>
<p>It is not as simple as simply blaming Social Media for eveything, undoubtedly it is a leading cause of social issues, but it is infinitely more complax than the surface level issues pointed at.</p>

<p>Currently, I am learning front end coding skills, as well as digesting all the information I can find relating to user experience, not just for the web but everywhere else. Part of this is learning the true meaning of design.</p>
<p>Not just making things look pretty, making them usable, easy to understand and creating better experiences for everyone. These skills have opened my eyes to the lack of design and thought that goes into many things in the world, and something that started out as a simple learning exercise has changed the way I look at the world completely.</p>
<p>My town recently has been turned upside down by closing a railway bridge and blocking off traffic from getting through one of the main routes in and out. The signs placed on the approaching road simply read “Road Closed Ahead” and many people <em>still</em> got stuck. People started blaming drivers for not paying attention, and all sorts of random reasons, but it became clear to me that the planners didn’t design their experience well enough.</p>
<p>Road closed signs mean nothing to people that don’t know which road is actually closed, nor that the bridge is closed. The lack of thought and planning the experience of people leads to chaos for a few days until someone realised their mistake. People using routes in and out of the town can’t rely on local knowledge like the planners can, they have inside knowledge that allows them to understand the underlying information, but not see the actually message they are giving.</p>
<p>In everything you create you must think, plan, design and get feedback from others. It is often hard to see thorough other people eyes, and failure to realise that others may not have the same level of insight as you can lead to failure. A few traffic jams are nothing to worry about in the grand scheme of things, but if a customer doesn’t understand where to check out they won’t buy from you. If a reader doesn’t understand what you are explaining they won’t be a reader much longer.</p>

     <p>I am currently walking a new path of self-discovery. I haven’t disappeared to India or been on any vision quests to find myself (yet), but as a whole, I was simply not happy the way I was going, so I changed direction. The choices I was making and things I was doing were affecting the way I felt and, like many people, I simply disliked the way I felt.</p><p>Working online all day, every day and then spending large portions of my free time online was becoming a drain on my mind. I was filling every little slice of boredom with Twitter, Reddit, or mindless scrolling the web that I was becoming frustrated with myself.</p><p>Like every bad tradesman the knee-jerk reaction was to blame the tools. Blame the internet, web designers, and all the things around me for being made to distract me. I sought out a smaller phone, one that I didn’t feel like using as much, I restricted my usage of the internet when not working, and time blocked my calendar to make me indistractable while working.</p><p>This worked, it made me realise that I was turning a ridiculous potion of my life into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_time">dead time</a>. Passively waiting or searching for something to distract me and give me something to do. I didn’t even know these things were distracting me, because I had no idea what I wanted to be gaining traction towards. By removing those things I filled my time with allowed me to read more, do more, and have more meaningful relationships. Exactly the types of things that life should be built around and that make me a much happier person.</p><p>I am not exaggerating when I say that removing many of the things that I used to find important in my life allowed me to see how utterly meaningless they were. It is true that you must let go of what you love the most, and see if it returns, and as I let go of a lot of social media usage, it never returned.</p><p>While in internet is full of ways to grab your attention from you, and getting worse the deeper we go into <a href="/2020/09/01/the-trickle-down.html">the attention economy</a>, it is not the reason I was so distracted. Manipulation by platform developers only goes so far toward hacking your brain. What I quickly realised was that I had a choice to do these things or not, it was internally that I was so susceptible to the triggers used.</p><p>I started paying attention to the triggers that whisked me away down an internet rabbit hole, and by and large, it wasn’t the internet's fault — it was mine. When I was honest with myself and realised that because of my internal triggers I was searching for things to fill my time, the external triggers worked like a charm. I didn’t need to resort to a worse phone, or disconnect myself — I just needed to be mindful of the distractions and make myself <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Indistractable-Control-Your-Attention-Choose-ebook/dp/B07QCC61Y3/">indistractable</a>.</p>

<p>I realised after sending last weeks newsletter that I never completed the story of my lust for a simpler time. It didn’t end as <a href="https://gr36.com/cant-go-back/">far back as I wanted to go</a>, because there is no denying in the modern world I pretty much <em>have</em> to have an smartphone, but it thankfully got pretty far.</p>
<p>I am now the proud owner of two iPhone SE’s (SEes? SI?). I bought a used OG iPhone SE first, and used this for a week of peace. The size shift was much easier than I expected and my non essential usage dropped to zero. During this period though the battery life was a huge issue, and I resorted to buying a 2020 iPhone SE instead.</p>
<p>I am not exaggerating when I say that this phone is the best one I have ever owned. For £429 I have a phone that is much lighter, easier to manage and has all the modern innards I love. I have made some bold statements on <a href="https://gr36.com/links/we-might-be-getting-that-120hz-iphone-12-after-all/">not being interested in anything new Apple has to offer</a>, but I honestly could not see myself using anything else without a <em>really</em> good reason. I may write a longer thought post on ‘downgrading’ at a later date, but it safe to say I am over the moon with a simpler tech life.</p>
<p>I have a new level of emotional ambivalence towards my smartphone and I wish others did. I love the connectivity options it gives me, but don’t like having to use it — weird I know.</p>

     <p>You will never in your life posses something that is as important as your attention. The notice you take of someone or something is so craved after that throughout history those that have sought it have performed some of the worst and best acts humankind has ever seen. Yet we give it away without a moment of thought towards where it is spent.</p><p>The Accident Greeks wrote the very tale many of the modern condition are named after, Narcissus could be a tale told today about Instagram influencers or Facebook moms groups. Its tale told us the dangers of too much attention, and hinted at how much it is worth, but in modern times the most valuable thing we have is being manipulated, sought by companies, and trickled down onto us like drug crazed zombies.</p><p>Alphabet and Facebook are two of the richest companies in the world. Both companies rely heavily if not solely on the user as their product. Sure Facebook may attempt to sell cameras now, and Google does give you a suite of apps and sell a few phones, but these are drops in the ocean compared to the advertising they sell.</p><p>You are the most important thing to them, you are the thing they lust after, your attention the fuel that grids the gears of their business and you are being manipulated for it. Having your <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00556G7LU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">attention span shortened and your ability to concentrate eroded</a> simply so companies can make money from you. Using <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2020/09/2018-06-27-deceived-by-design-final/">dark patterns and un-ethical web design</a> to manipulate our base instinct and change our brains and erode our society.</p><blockquote>Facebook – Takes your data in exchange for being able to brag about yourself and stalk your friends. – <a href="https://www.nathanlustig.com/siren-servers-why-are-we-ok-with-giving-away-our-data/">Nathan Lustig</a></blockquote><p>As Justin Lanier <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jaron-lanier-tech-oracle-profile">points out</a> Social media is in some ways “worse than cigarettes, in that cigarettes don’t degrade you. They kill you, but you’re still you.” Social media is changing us for the worst, creating attention seeking, narcissistic ego driven monsters that can’t even see what’s wrong. Like many addicts, heavy users react with aggression and dismissal at the very suggestion of being manipulated and cheated out of their attention.</p><h2 id="all-eyes-on-me">All Eyes On Me</h2><p>Unfortunately, it is no longer the companies themselves that crave the attention you so easily give away. So much effort is placed on gaining your attention that now, users crave it themselves too. On every platform that promotes the sharing of information attention is sought from others. Users are encouraged to share more and more personal details about their daily life for others to see, and companies to use to show you better adverts.</p><p>It is even evident in niche services such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/iiabox/strava_wankers_rant/g36ouxt/">Strava</a> and <a href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/zwift-cracking-cheats-hackers-organisation-polices-racing-434487">Zwift</a>, both platforms designed to benefit athletic training and improve fitness. There is no reason for cheating on platforms like this, other than internet points. Nothing is gained from being at the top, or using a car instead of a bike to map your ride, other than to receive the attention they crave.</p><p>Don’t think this is a young persons game either, in fact, some evidence suggests that this constant craving for attention exists worse in middle-aged individuals. Cases of people <a href="https://www.mentalhelp.net/advice/craving-attention/">seeking help for this kind</a> of conditions has skyrocketed in modern times. Not keeping feelings like this in check can evolve into Histrionic personality disorder (HPD) and affect the lives of individuals. Many doctors believe that HPD is shaped by the psychological factors of an individuals surroundings. Heavy users of social media with reduced personal interaction could be having <a href="https://psychcentral.com/disorders/histrionic-personality-disorder/">their personality shaped</a> by their online environment.</p><p>Although attention seeking is fairly common in childhood, the skills needed to cope with these stressors are formed in early life. As much as a child learns that by creating a scene they have all the eyes on them, an adult learns that attention can off set insecurities, help cope with jealousy focused on others, and any number of feelings they are unable to deal with.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="uploads/2024/fc39e84479.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="5184" height="3456" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@gaberce?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Gabe Pierce</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="it-s-all-harmless-fun">It’s All Harmless Fun</h2><p>Unfortunately, it is easy to see why. It’s hard to find a downside to all the attention people can gain, but a few posts online fishing for feedback is one thing, but if these feelings can quickly resolved into conditions such as <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/ConditionsAndTreatments/munchausen-syndrome">Munchausen syndrome</a>. A particularly nasty metal illness that leads to the faking of illness so more attention and focus is gained by the individual. Something that can also be suffered by proxy, and resulted in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley_Allitt">death of four children, and injury to many more</a> by one person in the 1990’s. So next time you think that attention seeking is harmless, makes sure you realise how important it is.</p><p>This was long before the likes of Facebook and Instagram came along, meaning mental illness could be exacerbated in modern times. As attention is so much easier to attain when you can speak to millions of people in seconds. Munchausen syndrome now features a <a href="https://insights.ovid.com/article/00007611-200093070-00006">‘by internet’</a> variation specifically for those that deceive people with fake illness for attention on the internet. Attention is so easy to gain online if you just know the right buttons to press and the right things to do. But you can’t blame this all on individuals, because of course all the attention sought by users means fantastic business for the companies selling adds.</p><p>More eyeballs on websites means more money in the bank account from people wishing to advertise to you. Platforms are built with these types of things in mind. Attention, chaos and emotions outpouring onto their website leads more eyeballs and more adverts seen. Remember the psychological stress we talked about earlier that can lead to all sorts of mental health issues. Well, Facebook were caught out <a href="//www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2014/06/28/facebook-manipulated-user-news-feeds-to-create-emotional-contagion/#7177023e39dc">manipulating emotional distress</a> in their news feed, just for users attention. Unfortunately for its users, if Zuckerberg needs attention, the users must provide it, and by the bucket load.</p><p>Social media usage doesn’t cause metal health issues, but the constant push for more and more attention can breed the conditions for it to flourish. Sure enough, only an individual can judge if social media is a distraction or not, and giving something your attention is one thing, but being manipulated intentionally to waste more and more time is another. Business models built around attention and time spent on site has shifted much of our society to a new way of life. One where our time and our ability to concentrate are not being stollen, they are being given away freely. Nothing good can come of this.</p>

<p>A year ago I would have been all over these types of things, giving my opinions and talking about it to anyone that would listen. I would have convinced myself that I NEED this new model because the screen will be so much better to use.</p>
<p>Now, every feature rumour I see does not make a difference to the way I use my phone any longer. Which is sparingly and for quick little tasks.</p>

What can I say I am a sucker for a freebie and even if I have no intention of paying out any money for an app or service I will sign up and try it for a bit. It’s a great way to be exposed to new things and test things out, as with something like <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/roam-research/">Roam Research</a>, I am sometimes surprised and sign up anyway.</p>
<p>This can be a nightmare on the web, after some nasty accidents I have to set reminders to cancel services with a link in plenty of time, so I don’t get charged. Yet on iOS all of that stress is taken away from me, and Apple will even warn me just before I am due to pay with a small heads up. Delete an app with an active subscription, Apple warns me with a pop up — and if I want to cancel anything they are all in one easy to manage page right on my phone.</p>
<p>Couple this with the fact I can pay Apple and not have to go through any websites and give my information to anyone else and I will gladly pay a little extra to keep my information safe and not get any unwanted expenditure.</p>
<p>I understand this is a fairly unique position to be in, but when the worst comes the worst and money leaves your bank, if Apple handles everything you know where to turn. Where would I go if an app or service I signed up for on my iPhone takes money from me but Apple didn’t handle the payments? Left to try and get in touch with a company I know very little about.</p>
<p>even when making payments for things online, I always opt for the Apple Pay or Paypal option because I simply don’t trust many other options. I don’t have to worry about the security and practices of the company I am buying from because they only get basic information about me. In some cases they won’t even receive my email!</p>
<p>What is there not to love about one company doing it all for you, that company could be Apple, Google, or whoever, the point is I have one company to worry about and I trust Apple more than any other company on the planet to do the job well and keep me secure.</p>
<p>I thought long and hard about this post, it has squandered in my drafts folder for a few days for risk of being drawn into an argument I don’t care about. This is no comment on the current issues surrounding how much Apple takes as its cut or blocks apps that try other options. It is simply my opinion that I am thrilled the Apple manages everything for me.</p>

     <p>eading comes easy to most of us, you pick up a book and read the words on the page. It’s so simple that almost anyone can do it in some way or another, however there are many factors that may dictate what you take away from the experience and how you consume the book. My reading pattern has changed a lot over the last few months and I have seen <a href="https://thedent.net/2020/08/10/dear-book-reading.html">a few posts</a> asking about other experiences when reading — so here is mine.</p><h2 id="books">Books</h2><p>This is kind of the most important part right, can’t read witout a book. I consume around a book a week, but sometimes much less depending on my free time. I read much more now that I have cut down my web use dramatically and consume much less TV (COVID–19 FTW).</p><p>Generally, I have two books on the go at once, sometimes more, but this will always be one fiction and one non-fiction. These are often read at different points, and used for difference things. My non-fiction books are read just before falling asleep or if I lack the ability to concentrate on much else and just want to chill out. These are usually very light reading such as the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Scott-Mariani/e/B0034O6648?ref_=dbs_p_ebk_r00_abau_000000">Ben Hope Books</a>, or something of a similar vein.</p><p>As well as this I will have a non-fiction book on the go for the times I am more alert or fancy learning something. Some of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products-ebook/dp/B00NW01MKM/ref=sr_1_11?dchild=1&amp;keywords=habbits&amp;qid=1597992860&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-11">these books</a> have kept me until ridiculous times in the morning because they are so interesting and thought-provoking — sense why I typically have two books.</p><h2 id="kindle">Kindle</h2><p>I read almost every book on my <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/amazon-kindle-oasis-8-gb-adjustable-warm-light-waterproof-graphite/dp/B07L5GDTYY">Kindle Oasis</a>. This was an expensive investment into a reader but it was worth it for me. Most people opt for the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/paperwhite?tag=googhydr-21&amp;ref=pd_sl_4s1f4ymfv4_e">Paperwhite</a>, which is exactly what I advise everyone that asks to get, and if you wait for the right time they are quite often on sale.</p><p>I would much prefer to read a paper book, they feel much better and give a tactile feedback that I really enjoy. But the books afterworlds took up too much space for me, so I wanted to be able to store loads of books in a small form that I can use where I want.</p><p>There are some books that I really want to enjoy, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bhagavad-Gita-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449183/ref=sr_1_2?crid=38X146RBBK1JA&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=bagavadgita&amp;qid=1597992296&amp;sprefix=bagava%2Caps%2C144&amp;sr=8-2">The Bhagavad Gita</a> that I purchased in paperback because I consume then very slow and numbing through a book just adds to the experience.</p><h2 id="highlighting">Highlighting</h2><p>Reading on a Kindle also offers me the ability to highlight things that I want to remember. These are usually small bits of information that display certain details of the book I am reading, things I want to look deeper into, or just great quotes. I <em>could</em> do this in a paperback, but it would be much more hassle.</p><p>Once I have finished the book, or sometimes part way through, I log into the <a href="https://read.amazon.com/notebook">Amazon notebook</a> and copy all the highlights into a book note. This is where I make my notes about the book I have read and digest the information from it. Currently, I am using <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/roam-research/">Roam Research</a> and this has made making and linking these notes together much easier than ever before. Find out more about this practice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzTOFgohiPw">here</a>.</p><p>I don’t do this for every book I read, but for most non-fiction books I usually end up highlighting some bits so this dictates if I take some notes or not. This helps me retain much more information from the book and look deeper into some topics I have discovered.</p><h2 id="pocket">Pocket</h2><p>I save all of the things on the web I want to read into Pocket. This is the best value for money app that I pay for. You can use it free, but I just want to support the apps development. In Pocket I can highlight just as I would on my Kindle and copy these into Roam if I want to store them for later.</p><p>Pocket also helps surface articles that it thinks I will like, and often does a really good job of showing me things that I enjoy. I share all of the interesting things I find on there, so you can <a href="https://getpocket.com/@f1ag8d23paKXzA52b2TRj2fT87Abp5906ePH51t767g18cg7fY10ZeePF32ZwO3b">follow me if you wish</a>.</p>

<p>I have a huge fear of missing out on productivity apps. It doesn’t matter if it is something new or a service I have tried before, if someone posts about how they use things, I have to try the thing to see if it’s better than what I currently have.</p>
<p>I try really hard to not get invested too quickly because most things revert to their previous states, but only after I have spent hours playing around with a new set up. With all that said, the excitement I felt when watching <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/a-practical-introduction-to-roam-research/">Matt Birchler’s overview of Roam Research</a> was something I have not felt in a long time.</p>
<p>After hearing a bit of hype around the launch, I initially dismissed Roam as being for academic research or more in-depth writing than I needed. But Matts video showed his use of Roam for work meetings and something clicked.</p>
<p>I won’t go into much of what it can do here, but I now finally have a note taking service that works the same way my brain does. I have often felt trapped in traditional notes apps concept of hierarchy. With notes only able to live based on their relationships to other notes or notebooks. This is true in Roam, but no note lives just because of its relationships to others, it is fluid and complex. Making it straightforward to move between notes laterally and find the information I need.</p>
<p>Be warned though — it’s ridiculously expensive.</p>

<p>On my return from holiday I bought something special, something that will allow me to work better, improve <a href="https://gr36.com/my-set-up-and-want-for-more/">my set up</a>and also enable me to work from home, but not always be at my desk.</p>
<p>Of course, I bought a MacBook Pro, and I am a little in love with the keyboard. Despite the butterfly version’s tendency <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design">to break all the time</a>, and being a little strange to get used to, I thought it was perfectly fine. I typed out hundreds of thousands of words on it with no issues (I was one of the lucky ones), but the new old version returns to proper key switches and it is brilliant to write on.</p>
<p>Couple this with the improvements in my motivation, implementing some more creative practices and writing more notes, people have already noticed more posts coming out. This new laptop hasn’t caused it, but it has certainly helped.</p>
<p>I’m not publicly <a href="https://gr36.com/today-is-the-day-i-quit-the-ipad/">quitting the iPad again</a>, more refraining from trying to fit a round peg in a square hole. The iPad is great for most things, but I use too many web tools not developed for anything other than a desktop browser, which is no fault of Apple. There are still a few quirks to iron out of iOS for me (Apple Notes still doesnt use CMD+K) but most of all, if I am being perfectly honest, I just feel more at home on macOS now.</p>
<p>My desk set up will become much slimmer, less intrusive when I am not actually working, and this thing is so powerful I can do all my design and creative work anywhere I like. We have discussed travelling a little in the next few weeks whilst still working so it is all exciting times ahead.</p>

<p>As with everything I get invested in I like to go in deep and see what it can really do. One of the easiest ways to start to mould <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/roam-research/">Roam Research</a> to your will and make it unique for your use case is to add in CSS or JS. These are two official supported ways that are easy to implement and can also be removes at your will.</p>
<h2>Roam/css</h2>
<p>You can easily change the look and feel of Roam by tweaking the CSS of the pages. This can go from a little light modding, to in-depth changes on how the layout looks.</p>
<p>To start create a page called <code>roam/css</code> and simply add in a code block that specifies css. There are a huge range of options available already created and shared on the <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/fJRcVITNY">help pages</a>. I am currently using ‘<a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/nkj1JWWS4">Better Roam Research</a>’ to add in dark mode.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to change the code block to specify css, it defaults to Clojure.</p>
<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>
<h2>Roam/js</h2>
<p>If you want to go further into Roam and really start building things that customise it to your usage then roam/js is the place to be. There are a huge number of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/hj08fl/any_good_roamjs_files/">scripts available</a> that do everything from add more buttons, to change the way Roam works in the browser.</p>
<p>To add in this capability create a page call <code>roam/js</code> or just a block with this as its only contents. Nested under this write the following. <code>{{[[roam/js]]}}</code>, this will give you the following warning.</p>
<p>It is worth paying attention to this, and only run scripts you are familiar with as there are security and safety issues to bear in mind with javascript. If you are completely sure, click “Yes, I know what I am doing” once you have nested the script you wish to use underneath. You can stop the js from running at any point by clicking “stop this”.<!--kg-card-end: html--></p>
<p>This particular script I am running allows me to clear out empty Daily Notes pages and can be found <a href="https://paste.ee/p/syUGk">here</a>.</p>

     <p>The only thing that changes more than my task manager is my writing app. Not because I feature crave or move my blog all over the place, but because I really struggle with the environment. I love one place to store everything from short ideas, to articles to link and of course type out long essays. I don’t move often, but I certainly look at other options quite often.</p><p>So, a ‘writing app’ for me needs to be multifaceted and easy to use. It has to support markdown (that’s just how my brain works) and if possible make it easy to connect to. My current set up is none of those things but here’s why it’s the best thing I have ever found (that sounds like clickbait to me).</p><h2 id="apple-notes">Apple Notes</h2><p>My trusty notes app for collecting simple ideas and quick notes has barely changed. I have tried using the default iOS app for <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/using-apple-notes/">writing full posts too</a> and although it does OK, it just doesn’t cut it for publishing or copying posts into other apps. I use this mostly using Siri or Shortcuts to grab quick bits of information to refer to later.</p><h1 id="roam-research">Roam Research</h1><p>There are many, many things that I blame Matt Birchler for, and the vastest one of these is introducing me to this ‘app’. His excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDoOBUtxn8Q">overview of Roam</a> immediately hit home because of its powerful linking and note taking options. It isn’t a writing app at all, but has allowed me to write more than I ever have done simply by working the same way my brain does.</p><p>All of my posts start with a spark of an idea, it might be someone else’s blog post, a news article or something I have consumed during the day. Ideas jump out at me at all sorts of times and I quite often tap out the basis of a post in short bullet points of things to cover. Traditional note taking apps allow you to move between notes in a very restricted way, whereas with Roam I can use bidirectional links to string things together and notice connections I wouldn’t usually find.</p><p>I also use <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a> for gathering meeting notes, collecting together information for my day job and also writing my morning pages, so to have something that can do everything for me is something truly rare for me.</p><p>The downside of Roam is that it is expensive, and isn’t really an app per se. It’s simply a progressive web app, and so some shortcoming on mobile exist — this isn’t an issue for me, but will be for some that prefer a more native app experience.</p><h2 id="ulysses">Ulysses</h2><p>There is still nothing quite like Ulysses for fleshing out and finishing a post and hitting publish. It’s minimalistic but powerful workspace suits my needs perfectly. If Roam was my outliner and research bucket, Ulysses is where I polish the post until I am happy with it. For most posts my bullets and outlines are copied into Ulysses for me to finish off, tidy up and hit publish once ready.</p><p>That is not to say I couldn’t copy straight from Roam in markdown and publish to my blog, but I like to take the long way around. For continuity’s sake I then copy the finished article back into Roam with a blog post link incase I need to refer to it later. This keeps everything really neat and tidy. I may in future look at publishing with another app, and cut down my subscriptions costs, but currently these things fit really well together.</p>

     <p>There are many things that the current COVID-19 pandemic has destroyed. Forcing us all to readdress what is important is often painful, but also can be fulfilling if you look upon it positively. We are distant from each other like never before, we work alone and are connected only by cyberspace. We wear masks publicly and we stay at least 2meters away from everyone else.</p><p>It is a certain fear that is starting to become engrained in us, the stress of ensuring others around us are far enough away and doing as they should. Agonis ing if someone dares to step inside your distancing bubble. We wave goodbye to our friends without ever touching — and this could be the worst part of all.</p><blockquote>When we hug, our hearts connect, and we know that we are not separate beings. Hugging with mindfulness and concentration can bring reconciliation, healing, understanding, and much happiness. The practice of mindful hugging has helped so many people to reconcile with each other — fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, friends and friends, and so many others. — Nhat Hanh</blockquote><p>No longer shaking hands is one thing, but the avoidance of clutching those in an embrace takes away a deeply important part of connection. Thich Nhat Hanh recognises this in his practice of <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/01/02/sherwin-nuland-what-everybody-needs/">hugging meditation</a>. The other person becomes very real when they are in contact with you, they feel what you are expressing and experience the sensory feedback of your pressure against their skin. A level of connection and mindfulness that nothing else comes close to experiencing.</p><p>Missing embracing those around you is a natural loss, and one that we all morn. Something that we should not forget as things progress, hope is that we can return to a certain level of normalcy and hug each other once again.</p>

<p>Since picking through a few ‘self-help books’ and business related topics I read through Ryan Holidays <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ego-Enemy-Master-Greatest-Opponent-ebook/dp/B01AWUTMB0/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">Ego is the Enemy</a>. As many people that talk about the book note, I too spent the entire time reading it nodding along. Noticing traits in me and others that highlight how dangerous the Ego can be.</p>
<p>So, I sat down whilst on holiday and typed out a follow-up post about my battles with <a href="https://gr36.com/battling-ego/">ego and my desire to keep moving forward</a>. Highlighting my trait of often writing instructional posts that I don’t follow myself. Perhaps being overly critical to myself, but signing off in much better place than when I started.</p>
<p>Even though I sometimes take this ‘do as I say not as I do’ approach it can be a <a href="https://micro.blog/ChrisJWilson/10084291">rallying call to myself</a>. As much as when I write things in my morning pages advising myself what to do, it gives me something to look back on and compare to, and also myself a bit of a talking to.</p>
<p>Writing can often be cathartic and work in strange ways to help clear out thoughts in my head. Allowing me to deal with things and offer out a finality once I hit publish. If post like this don’t help <em>you</em>, they give a rallying call to myself, and that helps.</p>

Release dates, months-long campaigns of hype, and a laser focus on the process are all bad for our culture.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had never really thought about this until Simons post. This is a huge drain on my motivation to check out a service now, as many seem to release half baked products and then build the hype around it first before actually solving a problem.</p>
<p>Quite often the hype before launch is the only time companies can sell a serious level of products and they soon disappear into nothingness. Marketing and bluster can only get you so far, but its annoying while it lasts.</p>

This has been so blatant and marketed so well that many people think it has to be done to get the most out of technology – and feel powerless to do anything else.</p>
<p>There is a level of acceptance for personal privacy that is written off as the price of entry to the internet. With a general consensus that you must give over your data to get the most out of tools, and reap the benefits of what the World Wide Web has to offer. Google joins the dots between your browsing, email and search history and ties this all back to your personal account. All in the name of serving you better ads.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We really want to combat people’s learned helplessness in privacy. Everyone’s concerned, but a large percentage of people just think there’s nothing you can really do about it. We want to prove that you can do something.” – <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/duckduckgo-android-choice-screen-search">Gabriel Weinberg, CEO DuckDuckGo</a></p></blockquote>
<p>It is completely up to you if you value the data you exchange for goods and services that internet companies provide you. Google and Facebook are two of the worst but certainly not the only ones. Google in exchange for your data gives you a suite of free tools and apps that many find impossible to live without. Google search for instance, is so dominant because it knows so much information about you and tailors results to those that you want to see, rolling this into Google assistant, maps and all of its other services just for good measure.</p>
<p>Sounds like a great trade to many, because it depends on how much value you put on companies knowing all about you. Pichai can side step all the questions in the world by insisting that “most of the data we collect is to help users and provide personalised experiences back” but the reality is that the more data they get about you, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/googles-sundar-pichai-grilled-over-destroying-anonymity-on-the-internet/">more money they make</a>.</p>
<p>A personal data exhange should not be viewed as the price to get better tools, there are many <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">other options out there for users</a>, but they just don’t know about them. In many cases Google controls the services you use, the websites you see and even the browser you use. You’re not using the open internet, you are using a limited Google web that pushes their services on you.</p>
<p>Giving away your data only helps one thing and that is the companies bottom line.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>After spending some time setting up <a href="https://gr36.com/post-films-watched-micropub/">posting films to micropub</a>, I really wanted to get my reading sorted. There are great options out there like <a href="https://indiebookclub.biz/">indiebookclub</a> – but I wanted to automate it and make it possible every time I finish a book on my kindle.</p>
<p>With nothing fitting the bill I delved into the API (which is pretty good by the way) and came up with a solution. It relies on a developer key from Goodreads so I don’t promise how long this will work, they could pull this or remove your access to it at any point.</p>
<h2>Developer Key</h2>
<p>Goodreads will let anyone <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys">set up a developer key</a> for access to their API, all you need to add are a few details about yourself and agree to the developer terms. If you break these terms, they are well within their right to stop you using the service – so please read them.</p>
<p>Once agreed, you will need the top part labeled ‘key’ – keep this safe and don’t share it with anyone as it gives access to all of your information and you can read/write to your Goodreads account with it. A full list of API abilities are available <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/api">here</a>.</p>
<p>From here I researched what is available through the API and discovered you can pull books you have read from the following feed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/[ID].xml?key=[key]&amp;shelf=read
</code></pre>
<p>I have focused on updating micro.pub whenever I finish a book, but you can find extra information about books in your shelf by chaining after the <code>&amp;</code> to be <code>currently-reading</code> or <code>to-read</code>.</p>
<h2>IFTTT</h2>
<p>Once you have this information it is pretty easy to set up a posting trigger in your service of choice. IFTTT is completely free so is a win straight off the bat, but as a caveat is a little more complex to set up and I found a little limited to work with. This is personal preference, of course, but IFTTT is still very straight forward to set up.</p>
<p>Click on Create and chose RSS as your IF (the trigger), choose new item in feed and paste in your RSS feed. The Then (action) part is a Webhook to allow you to post to micropub services. For this example, I am going to run through micro.blog, but they all will all be pretty much the same.</p>
<p>Make a web request, and then put in the URL of your service, in this case it is <code>https://micro.blog/micropub</code>. Method is POST and content type is usually application/x-form-url-encoded. In the body you need two bits of information, an access code and what you want the post to display. This will be dependent on your service but in my micro.blog case I use the following.</p>
<p><code>access_token=ABCDEF&amp;content={{EntryContent}}&amp;name={{ItemTitle}}</code></p>
<p>With the access token generated in the setting of my micro.blog.</p>
<p>You can customise the body content to whatever you want to display in the post. If you leave this as is, then it will display the raw content of the RSS feed.</p>
<h2>Zapier</h2>
<p>This is a much more rounded service that makes it much easier to customise the post content, but at a cost of £20 per month. For this cost, you get the ability to automate many more things, so it might be worth considering but please bear this in mind.</p>
<p>Start by creating a new Zap, the trigger is RSS and the event is a new item in the feed. Paste in the RSS feed you have saved and that is all you need to do on this step as you don’t need any information to access this feed. On the next step Zapier will find the data — so make sure you’ve at least read one book, and then pull everything into Zapier.</p>
<p>The action is Webhooks, and the action event needs to be POST to tell micropub to post information. By customising the request you can go as deep as you like, this is where Zapier makes it so easy to post images, ratings and everything the feed contains effortlessly and understandably. To do this put the Micropub url into the first box, in my case this is <code>https://micro.blog/micropub</code> and leave the Payload type as Form.</p>
<p>Click the plus sign under Data, and type <code>content</code> into the first box, and then you can customise the post until your heart is content. Click the plus button again and type <code>access_token</code> into the first box and in the second one copy in an access code from micro.blog. Your service may not require this, but will usually require some kind of authentication.</p>
<p>All the other topics can remain as they are by default, by clicking continue you are given the option to test the post. Do this and check that everything appears correctly — you can always go back and change things before re-testing. This is another option that makes Zapier a great service to work with. Once you’re happy, finish everything off and now every time you finish a book it will post to Micropub.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Vishal Kataria <a href="https://aryatra.com/anteambulo/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every artist whose work made an impact did more than just his work. He appreciated the opportunities he got to clear the path for patrons which in turn, helped him see how things worked on the inside and opened new doors for him. Rather than getting angry about having to “serve others,” artists saw this as ways to add value to their patrons. In the process, they added value to their own work and lives.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Being an <em><em>anteambulo</em></em> is not about making others <em><em>look good</em></em>. It’s about providing others with support so that they can be better. It’s about associating with people <a href="http://aryatra.com/secrets-successful-people/" rel="noopener">more successful than yourself</a> and clearing the path for them. It’s about helping declutter their lives so that they can focus on their strengths.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Being an <em><em>anteambulo</em></em> is not being a sycophant. It’s not trying to make things <em><em>look better</em></em>. It’s not about sucking up to your boss so that you get a promotion or a better salary hike.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like Vishal I came across this concept reading <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ego-Enemy-Master-Greatest-Opponent-ebook/dp/B01AWUTMB0/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_">Ego is the enemy</a> and found it really interesting. Making life easier for successful or people in a position of power seems counter intuitive, but has been the path to greatness for so many people. It is simply ego stopping everyone from doing similar things and exploring the opportunities that come your way.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Kim Lyons for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/15/21370020/mozilla-google-firefox-search-engine-browser">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Most of Mozilla’s revenue comes from search engine companies like Google— as well as Yandex in Russia and Baidu in China— that pay for their search engine to be the default option in Firefox.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I really like Mozilla, their approach to something has been a bit strange, and they have wasted loads of time messing around with an OS and VR, but at the end of it all they have the open web as a whole at their heart.</p>
<p>But with that said, I don’t agree these agreements that Google makes to be the default search engine. They don’t just do it with Mozilla, they also pay <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/24/why-google-is-willing-to-pay-apple-12-billion-per.aspx">Apple billions</a> to be default on iOS, and I am sure elsewhere that we don’t hear about. It’s not just google, I don’t agree that any company should be the default, I believe that customer should be given the choice with transparent information about the different approaches.</p>
<p>Thankfully, regulators are starting to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlypage/2020/07/02/uk-regulator-takes-aim-at-apple-and-googles-billion-pound-search-deal/">take aim at these deals</a>. After the EU ruling on <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/duckduckgo-is-now-a-default-search-engine-option-on-android-in-the-eu/343073/">default search on Android</a>, Google must now implement a choice screen reminiscent of the browser screen on Windows from back in the day, for all new devices. Meaning that the data mining company presents the customer with more choice, that is ultimately going to make little difference.</p>
<p>Killing these deal will no doubt kill Mozilla, which is a huge shame, but if your company depends on these deals and is yet to make any money elsewhere, perhaps these deals are just preventing the inevitable. I don’t like Google controlling search because they then control access to products such as maps, but more users flocking to Chrome could possibly be worse.</p>
<p>Any company controlling the web is bad news, but when it’s Google it should be avoided at all costs.</p>

     <p>That’s the easy bit right. Sitting in the chair, then you’ve got to sort all your desk out, check out Twitter for a bit, change writing apps 3 times and then what?</p><p>Talking about writing is easy, what’s hard is actually writing anything and hitting publish. Deciding to do things, saying you are going to do things, anyone can do those two parts. Don’t believe me there is a <a href="https://novel.coryarcangel.com/">whole book about it </a>— but are you actually going to do something about it?</p><blockquote>Writing, like so many creative acts, is hard. Sitting there, staring, mad at yourself, mad at the material because it doesn’t seem good enough and you don’t seem good enough. — from “Ego is the Enemy: The Fight to Master Our Greatest Opponent” by Ryan Holiday</blockquote><p>Writing is one of those weird acts that everyone thinks is straightforward, but actually very few people can do consistently. More people should do it and simply stop messing around pretending to write and put something down — on paper, on a web page wherever you want put it — just sit in the chair and then do it.</p><p>There are a million reasons not to do it, not to start, not to carry on, and even more not to hit publish when you are done. You are not good enough, your posts are not getting enough views or even worse your blog doesn’t look like others. Whatever the reason to stop is, you either listen or you get going and publish something. Don’t just talk about it, do it.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>A year or so I wrote about the <a href="https://gr36.com/letting-your-ego-in/">trouble with letting your ego in</a>, what I really should of titled it is when I let <em>my</em> ego in, but stopped short because of well….ego.</p>
<p>It’s easy to write a blog post giving imaginary readers advice like you are someone that should be looked up to. Someone worthy of giving advice that has been learnt from previous mistakes; but my ego is funny like that and makes me think that I am. These types of posts can be easily described in the words of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_as_I_Say_(Not_as_I_Do)">Peter Schweizer’s</a> “do as I say not as I do”. Not only because the advice is often obvious and straightforward, but because I often fall foul of my own words.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Do you know how you can tell when someone is truly humble? I believe there’s one simple test: because they consistently observe and listen, the humble improve. They don’t assume, ‘I know the way.’”</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s easy to claim that your ego is an enemy to be battled, and examples can be given in bucket loads, but until you realise this for yourself it is often impossible to comprehend. Anecdotes that fill self help books, or are spoken about by individuals with a higher purpose are easy to ignore because they simply don’t apply to people like you — until you realise within yourself that they do.</p>
<p>Ego is not simply something individuals should be aware of in triumph or every day life, ego has a huge effect in times of failure and magnifies every mistake. Instead of embracing failure and the lessons that can be learnt, excuses are made because of comparisons to others and nothing is gained. Energy is wasted on thoughts about others, when it should be focused on learning and growing as a person.</p>
<p>Humbleness is one of the most claimed traits in a person, but very small numbers actually show it. It’s easy to claim to be, but showing this in everything you do is much harder. I let my ego in sometimes, as does everyone, but learning from these mistakes makes me a much better person — because you can’t grow and learn if you think you already know.</p>

     <p>When thinking about my smartphone usage I always long for something simpler. A life not filled with beeps and bings, one without a phone at all — but there is always something in the way. A need to be contacted, a reason to have emails pushed to your phone at all hours of the day or a drive to be contactable. So when all reasons in the world seem to conspire against you, at some point something has to give and I wasn’t prepared to change <em>my</em> stance.</p><p>When the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/10/19/148493/smartphones-are-weapons-of-mass-manipulation-and-this-guy-is-declaring-war-on-them/">notion was first posed</a> that smartphone were perhaps too good, I was dismissive. Overly critical at the very idea that a company must make their product worse in order to stop people using it so much. In fact it’s absurd, to think that people don’t have enough self control to sort themselves out and require someone else to do it for them. That reasoning still somewhat exists, but I don’t blame Apple for manipulating me, but I know it is written into the DNA of attention merchant companies.</p><p>It is almost impossible to resist without a hyper conscious focus on resisting the urges they pull on. This isn’t so much about self control, we aren’t dealing with having one too many donuts, these are base urges that are being used against us all. Each and everyone of us.</p><p>So I can hardly be critical when I know it’s happening, I am aware of the tricks and the techniques used — and still fall for them. So those less aware and less conscious about these issues stand no chance whatsoever, but they are hardly going to live without a smartphone without a serious hinderance on their lives. They are so ingrained in us now that in may places I can’t park my car, book a taxi or open my hotel door without needing an app for that. There is no way to go back, not now, not ever.</p><p>So my dream of using something dramatically different is dead, only accelerated by COVID-19 into a world filled with contactless payments, app purchases and smartphone addiction. I might need a smartphone to live, but I don’t need to use it more than essentials, I can remove a lot of usage with some effort.</p><p>My dream of going back has changed, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-really-want.html">my smartphone has changed</a> but my dream is not quite dead — yet.</p>

<p>Last week Chris Wilson opened up his newsletter <a href="https://learncreateshare.substack.com/p/sharing-despite-self-doubt?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNzM5ODM4LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo3NzEwNDYsIl8iOiJUSGJ3YiIsImlhdCI6MTU5NTc1MjAyNiwiZXhwIjoxNTk1NzU1NjI2LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItNDU5NzEiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.gGEKcZ15hKCqzKJR3bfcvlwcTs3LFeGa5IKLdvhIK08">‘Learn, Create, Share’</a> with the following quote.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Your problem,” my brother explained “is the same as mine. We’re bad at self-promotion because we were taught not to be boastful.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Undoubtedly this isn’t <em>the</em> reason I never made it as a writer or content producer, but it is something that I really don’t want to ever do. Sell myself to an online following is great if you can make a living out of it. However building a brand and resorting to clickbait titles, or constant self-promotion online is just not anything I ever want to resort to.</p>
<p>My online persona is the same as my real one, and I don’t see any reason to change. Fair play if that’s your thing, but too often I see great people I follow online build a following and then become boring bots of shameless self-promotion and shape themselves into something different.</p>
<p>Can it be self-promotion if you’re not being yourself?</p>

<p>He shouldn’t have to worry about the things he does at his age, but he does so with a smile on his face and a skip in his step.

<p>Newsletters are the new hotness. I know, I write one and you might have heard of it. There are a huge number of fantastic ones out there, providing content direct to your inbox and making good money doing it. So as with everything that starts to take off, every one thinks they can write a paid for newsletter now and unfortunately that just isn’t the case.</p>
<p>So many people are starting one up and asking for money straight off the bat it’s become in a bit of a joke. There is absolutely nothing wrong with monetising your product, be it a blog or newsletter, but you have to put some free work in first. Publishing your work should be the first step, getting consistency and pushing out things that people want to read builds the foundations.</p>
<p>How on earth can I get invested in paying for something if I have no confidence in you consistently publishing things. Spending a small amount of money on something you enjoy reading is a great thing to do, but asking for money upfront without content is a pretty crappy thing to even suggest.</p>
<p>It took more than 10 years of writing to even pay for my blog hosting, although I’m a pretty shitty writer, so monetisation will come, but put out the content for the love of doing first. Don’t ask for money too early because it comes off as needy, and may not turn out the way you think.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>I am currently experimenting with moving all of my social things to micro.blog. I know I have tried <a href="https://gr36.com/youre-not-cool-enough-for-micro-blog/">this before</a> (twice) but this time I don’t want it to be my blog I just want a place to hang out and post everything to. This will mainly be an Instagram replacement, posting checkins as most importantly books and films I have watched.</p>
<p>I can’t quite work out Goodreads yet, but by using <a href="https://letterboxd.com/">Letterboxed</a> I can post watched film easily using <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2017/api-posting/">Micropub</a>. You can of course use this with micro.blog but also with any service that support Micropub, so also applies to WordPress and other more mainstream services.</p>
<h2>Choose your way</h2>
<p>There are two relatively easy ways to do this, one free and one paid, both with pros and cons. They both rely on singing up to Letterboxed, and using your profile RSS feed to post updates. So, whichever you choose, you will need to sign up and then copy your feed address from your profile page. Once logged in, on the menu bar furthest to the right you will notice an RSS icon. Right click and copy this first.</p>
<h2>IFTTT</h2>
<p>This method is completely free so is a win straight off the bat, but as a caveat is a little more complex to set up and I found a little limited to work with. This is personal preference, of course, but IFTTT is still very straight forward to set up.</p>
<p>Click on Create and chose RSS as your IF (the trigger), choose new item in feed and paste in your RSS feed from Letterboxed. The Then (action) part is a Webhook to allow you to post to micropub services. For this example, I am going to run through a micro.blog, but they will all be pretty much the same.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-07-24-at-09.27.01-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/23cd288f5c.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 07 24 at 09 27 01 1" width="599" height="551" border="0" />Make a web request, and then put in the URL of your service, in this case it is <code>https://micro.blog/micropub</code>. Method is POST and content type is usually application/x-form-url-encoded. In the body you need two bits of information, an access code and what you want the post to display. This will be dependent on your device but in my micro.blog case I use the following.</p>
<p><code>access_token=ABCDEF&amp;content={{EntryContent}}&amp;name={{ItemTitle}}</code></p>
<p>With the access token generated in my setting of my micro.blog.</p>
<p>You can customise the body content to whatever you want to display in the post. If you leave this as is, then it will display the raw content of the RSS feed.</p>
<h2>Zapier</h2>
<p>This is a much more rounded service that makes it much easier to customise the post content, but at a cost of £20 per month. For this cost, you get the ability to automate many more things, so it <em>might</em> be worth considering but please bear this in mind.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-07-24-at-09.11.31-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/249f233fa1.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 07 24 at 09 11 31 1" width="1000" height="962" border="0" />Start by creating a new Zap, the trigger is RSS and the event is a new item in the feed, Past in the Letterboxed RSS feed you have saved and that is all you need to do on this step as you don’t need any information to access this feed. On the next step Zapier will find the data — so make sure you’ve at least recorded one watched film, and then pull everything into Zapier.</p>
<p>The action is Webhooks, and the action event needs to be POST to tell micropub to post information. By customising the request you can go as deep as you like, this is where Zapier makes it so easy to post images, ratings and everything the feed contains effortlessly and understandably. To do this put the Micropub url into the first box, in my case this is <code>https://micro.blog/micropub</code> and leave the Payload type and Form.</p>
<p>Click the plus sign under Data, and type <code>content</code> into the first box, and then you can customise the post until your heart is content. Click the plus button again and type <code>access_token</code> into the first box and in the second one copy in an access code from micro.blog. Your service may not require this, but will usually require some kind of authentication.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-07-24-at-09.12.01-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7a61b825bb.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 07 24 at 09 12 01 1" width="1000" height="919" border="0" />All the other topics can remain as they are by default, by clicking continue you are given the option to test the post. Do this and check that everything appears correctly — you can always go back and change things before re-testing. This is another option that makes Zapier a great service to work with. Once you’re happy, finish everything off and now every time you review a film it will post to Micropub.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>These kinds of posts usually start out as a small note in my journal or Apple Notes. Sometimes they stay there for quite a while because I am at risk of sounding like a grump old man – and <a href="https://gr36.com/life-through-a-lens/">not for the first time</a>.</p>
<p>However in Lockdown there has been an increase in social media posting that has continued now that things are easing (sorry America). When biking around, or walking with the family there has been a stark increase in people looking at their phones or constantly taking pictures. Posing with things, or shameless self promotion, you know the types of posts I mean.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking photos, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gr36m/">I love it</a>, I take far too many of them – but I don’t miss the world for a shot. When everything on Instagram is fake, what exactly is the point of posting. It’s supposed to be about showing what you are doing, not doing things so you can show them.</p>
<p>Stop missing the world, or watching it through the screen of a phone – put it down and live it.</p>

<blockquote><p>No user in their right consciousness would look to opt-in for personalised ads considering its used for monetisation purposes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Quite often there is a push back, usually from people regarding Google, that they would rather see relevant ads than random ones. Whilst this could be true, the ad tracking and data storage doesn’t just stop with seeing more relevant ads, its tracks everything about you for no good purpose.</p>
<p>Personalised ads should be viewed as manipulation, and unfortunately most people just don’t join the dots. Whilst the statement above is a bit bold, as I think most people just taps yes because they don’t care – they really should start caring.</p>

<p>I will preface this by saying that some transgressions are simply unacceptable, and deserve no understanding. However currently, whenever I see people being shamed for holding an alternative view point and ‘pilled on’ by social media I think about the stories in Jon Ronson’s excellent book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/So-Youve-Been-Publicly-Shamed-ebook/dp/B0196HJ6OS/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=56190338627&amp;dchild=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwjLD4BRAiEiwAg5NBFsuOgr1VHgrOgwUp296WSDbNd6tzQCcjfpYeNPEsx8q3wzDmteFrxxoCSMgQAvD_BwE&amp;hvadid=259084702764&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1006745&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=1814641648316723248&amp;hvtargid=kwd-304224817332&amp;hydadcr=10833_1789925&amp;keywords=so+you%27ve+been+publicly+shamed&amp;qid=1594634320&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=googhydr-21">So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed</a>.</p>
<p>This is full of stories that were once the outrage of the internet, and are now looked back on with embarrassment. i think we will look back on people like David Shor and institutions like The Tattered Cover with the same remorse.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When I think about <a href="https://gr36.com/stop-wearing-my-watch/">ditching my Apple Watch</a> after five years of faithful usage, I can only ever get about 90% there. The easy part is working out how I am going to use my phone and finding ways to stay connected only when needed and remove it entirely when I wish to switch off. Unfortunately that last few tweaks to my usage never fall into place.</p>
<p>There is one pretty big issues that I am not sure I can find a way around yet, it’s caused all sorts of headaches and stress already. I cant for the life of me work out how any one manages notifications without an Apple Watch.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time I have thought about my notifications and <a href="https://gr36.com/notifications-haze/">managing them</a>. It’s been a struggle since climbing up the corporate ladder — emails pinging at all times of the day and night. Factor in loads of apps that want your attention, and it could soon become a nightmare.</p>
<p>I love the peace and quiet, I love not having a tan mark on my arm, and I love the fact that I have one less bit of tech to manage. I just don’t know how anyone puts up with dings and phone ringtones in their life.</p>
<p>From the first time I put on my Apple Watch I don’t think my phone has been switched off silent. The Apple Watch allows me to be notified about what I want to show up, but with a subtle tap on the wrist. No buzzing, no dings and much less stress. I can often action it right then and there, without even needing to pick up my phone — I am actually getting comfortable answering the odd phone call from the Apple Watch too.</p>
<p>How on earth people manage notifications I really don’t know. For the longest time I have turned everything off but messages, phone calls and emails from VIPs and it’s still too much without a watch to screen everything. So for now, the Apple Watch remains attached to me like a life jacket, there to stop me downing in noise.</p>

<p>Marketing companies have been offered use of Apple tools to make sure ad targeting is working and numbers are reported well. This uses anonymous aggregated data – but this still isn’t enough. The tool is “engineered to not track users, there’s no need to request permission to track,” Brandon Van Ryswyk, an Apple privacy engineer,</p>
<p>These companies want access to user specific data and clear tracking of clearly defined individuals. These are not marketing businesses, they are spying on you and have made it looks like advertising.</p>

<p>I would hope that no body starts morning that I am not writing about enough technology lately, but I’m finding it hard to write about anything at all. Never mind getting motivated to write about the very little news going around. I have been spending my time <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/cycling/">riding my bike when</a> weather allows, but when the bad weather comes I have to take it inside to the virtual playground of <a href="https://zwift.com/athlete/7b4045fa-cc88-4e49-92b4-f871e8811ef4">Zwift</a>.</p>
<p>Writing recently in <a href="https://gr36.com/gtt-9/">my newsletter</a> I covered my love of the cycling (and running) platform and trying to gamify my cycling as much as possible. I’m still in the very early stages but having just crossed into level 11, my aim is to complete as many of the available routes as possible. Unfortunately Zwift is not great at this, and although the information is obtainable, it’s not easy to work with. So I spent some time building a way to track it.</p>
<p><br /><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8335452151565777" data-ad-slot="5524743860"></ins></p>
<p>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</p>
<p>There are loads of posts discussing several online and offline manual methods plotting out distances, XP points and the dreaded hilly bits. Thankfully a huge amount of data exists about each route, because so many people have ridden them. While looking for ways to automate this I stumbled on some spreadsheet methods on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zwift/comments/eqles5/i_made_a_complete_list_of_the_zwift_route_badges/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">Reddit</a>, and put together my own version combining several of them.</p>
<p>It’s dead easy to use, most routes link to information about the route you will take and the world used. The spreadsheet itself outlines distance covered (KM) and distance claimed (M) during the route, as well as the XP you will be rewarded for completing it. After a few weeks I am only at 12 % due to better weather currently, but I have done some of the worst – <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/route/road-to-sky/">Road to Sky</a> up Alpe Du Zwift, and <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/route/mountain-8/">Mountain 8</a> up the Epic KOM I particularly hated.</p>
<p><br /><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8335452151565777" data-ad-slot="5524743860"></ins></p>
<p>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</p>
<p>Don’t forget some worlds are only <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/schedule/">open on certain days</a> so plan accordingly. Grab the spreadsheet from <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2021/01/Zwift-Routes-Download.xlsx">here</a> and start Zwifting!</p>

     <p>Something that I am constantly thinking about is broadening my horizons and appreciating other peoples interests and points of view. Something that is actually quite difficult to do, as it seems we are preprogrammed to believe our own points of view above all else and defend our positions. So, some of this is understandable, but we owe it to ourselves and others around us to be better people.</p></p>
<p>I don’t believe that anything in life is binary, it can be not completely good or bad. You can find positives in everything, and if 2020 has taught me anything, it is that there a whole load of people I once respected that live in a bubble of their choice. Many fail to see that their experiences are not what others have felt and share some disgusting opinions online.</p>
<p>I am talking disputing systematic racism levels of idiocy. View points that will affect others should be questioned as much as possible and living in a bubble of your mind won’t help you do this. I urge everyone reading my newsletter to breakout of your normal and experience other peoples view points and beliefs. Certainly challenge them, but spend time learning why and how they have come to this view point — you just might learn a thing or two.</p>
<p>On the plus side, I follow a few less people on Twitter now.</p>

<p>For the past year, I have been running my blog on the <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost platform</a>. It gave me the ability to have a site as fast as the static one I used to have, but with a much more powerful CMS behind it. When first testing it out and setting up memberships I knew this platform would be for me.</p>
<p>It allows me to keep control of everything from payments to blog posts, and send emails to you all at the push of a button.</p>
<p>Lately though it has been suffering from poor updates that have affected the site structure and inner workings. Updates have been released and then having to be patched a few hours latter due to some bug or another. Unfortunately the 3.22 update removed all the sites menus and emails settings, with a fix not easy to achieve.</p>
<p>This time I had made a snapshot of my server before updating, but this was just dumb luck not great planning. Having had to resort to the support forums for a few days running I have run out of patience with the lacklustre testing going on. I don’t want to bad mouth developers doing their best, but updates to the blog will be few and far between for the time being, until I can be confident these kinds of issues are sorted.</p>
<p>I don’t see myself switching anywhere else, but its times like these when a Mailchimp email and a WordPress blog seem like some welcome, if a little boring, tech resilience.</p>

<p>Seth Godin on <a href="https://seths.blog/2020/08/posing-for-selfies/">posing for selfies</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The irony is that the people we’re most likely to want to trust and engage with are the ones who don’t pose. They’re consistent, committed and clear, but they’re not faking it. – <a href="https://seths.blog/2020/08/posing-for-selfies/">Seth Godin</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I seriously doubt Seth reads my newsletter but this post seems to tug on the things that I was approaching last edition. The apparent rise and rise of taking pictures just to show off what you are doing, or rather doing things just so you can pose for photos.</p>
<p>This isn’t new information but those people online you flex your ego to are not your real friends, those likes you get doesn’t mean they like you — the people around you are your friends. They know the real you, who you actually are and they see the difference in who you are on social media. Put the phone down and enjoy those people instead of showing off to people online.</p>

<blockquote><p>Google, on the other hand, takes a different approach. Google literally stores exactly where you are, where you have been, and even the route you took. And, it saves that data. Sure, you could go in and delete the information Google has stored, if you happened to know how or where it was located. In reality, very few people did that.</p></blockquote>
<p>The minimal approach has its benifits, but also its downsides. When better results come from Google having more data – most people opt for that.</p>
<p>You be forgiven for thinking that people outside of the tech bubble care about their personal data to a level that these types of posts do. The worry fact is they don’t. Bilions of people still use Facebook.</p>
<p>Google has its place, and it is at the heart of most peoples internet – and that’s not going to change.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Nothing can ever be perfect, and Hey is no different. It takes some thought to get used to all the features, but there are some things that I would really like to see implemented in the near future. I have every confidence the service will be imported following feedback, so investment in this is well worth it in my opinion. Heres some things that I would like and ideas about how they could work.</p>
<h2>Import of Mbox</h2>
<p>This is a biggie, and almost the one that put me off switching over. I really would like to see the ability to import all my old email, so I can be done with gmail forever. There are emails, files and all sorts fo information I am almost constantly referring back to, so I really need to only rely on once service.</p>
<p>Hey allows you to export your email in the mbox format, so I would really love to see them allow it the other way. This would allow me to set up my filters better than ever. This would put strain on their storage and servers though, and I do understand that they want you to have a fresh new start.</p>
<h2>Smarter Notifications</h2>
<p>As it stands currently there is no way for me to know that there are emails in My Feed or Paper Trail. I am currently checking periodically and it’s a bit of a pain. I completely understand that these types of emails are supposed to be out of sight, but some notification would be great.</p>
<p>Currently, I can turn notifications on for some emails that go into the feed, such as my <a href="https://gr36.com/signup/">wonderful newsletter</a> but I think it is too much work to filter these. Being able to set notification or notification levels would be the perfect balance. Perhaps I don’t want a push notification, but a discrete banner to let me know my bill has arrived such as below.</p>
<h2>Navigation Improvements</h2>
<p>The team need to improve the way to get from Imbox to Paper Trail and The Feed particularly on mobile. Currently, you must tap on the Hey button, tap the area you wish to go to. This isn’t too much hassle, but when you wish to go to the next area, swiping back and the repeating the process becomes tiresome.</p>
<p>A tabbed menu at the bottom would be too much and defeat the whole purpose of putting marketing emails and receipts out the way, so some thought around this is needed.</p>
<h2>The Feed</h2>
<p>Newsletters are my thing. Reading them in Hey is great as they are all filtered out, bar a few marketing emails mixed in that I still want to see. However, What about them disappearing from the feed completely when I have read them?</p>
<p>Currently, the feed displays everything that has arrived with nothing to say you’ve seen it before. A small notification for some that I like reading straight away would also be a helpful addition.</p>
<p>There you have it. Not many things that I haven’t got my head around and made Hey my email service of choice. I would really like to see the mbox import if all else fails. Just so I can finally move over completely. 🙏</p>

<p>This is the first time in a long time I have had something effortless to talk about. Two things that have been large in my life and felt like they matter to me again. Things are starting to come back, but I have a feeling they will never be back to normal. Unfortunately I spend no time traveling and no time in my office, so I am listening almost no podcasts.</p>
<p>I am not alone either, it’s great to not have to travel all the time and commute to meetings all the time, but I feel I am missing a certain amount of information by not listening to my beloved podcasts. The only time I can grab an episode or two is while running, and that doesn’t happen very often since becoming much more <a href="https://gr36.com/injured-best-thing-health/">inclined to take my bike out</a>.</p>
<p>Listening seems to have shifted to an <a href="https://medium.com/acast/how-covid-19-is-changing-the-podcast-landscape-now-and-what-the-data-tells-us-about-the-future-81210e504aff">at home experience for some</a>, but I just can’t make it stick. If I try to do things whilst listening then I don’t pay nearly as much attention and often missing large sections. Ultimately, I just don’t feel as engrossed as I am if I listen while driving. No great loss, but I do feel less informed than normal — perhaps that’s a good thing.</p>

<p>Now is not the time to start talking about features, there is enough coverage out there for you to find out all the details. What is relevant is the experience and the way in which Apple competed their keynote and it was interesting to say the least.</p>
<p>Thankfully for my inner nerd instead of cancelling the event, Apple took the whole event online. WWDC is usually packed full of developers and press, and tickets to be able to attend the headline keynote are well thought after. People packed into a theatre obviously isn’t possible at the moment, so attending as out, but the video portion took on a completely new feel.</p>
<p>The whole keynote was prerecorded, with special effects, cleaver editing and a really nice feel. It managed to keep Apples usual flair and in jokes but got straight to the point. I enjoyed it much more and it was easier for my wife to suffer through it due to not feeling pushed out. Ultimately the event felt more approachable for almost everyone, it was much easier to understand and didn’t get dragged off talking about retail or revue income.</p>
<p>If I could choose, id like Apple to keep the more streamlined appeal, but also with some in person feel. What that looks like I am not sure, but it helped not to have to pause after every announcement for whooping in the audience. Developers have also <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1275849771190759427">felt more able to code alongside</a> an event you can pause and rewind, so I think everyone will benefit from the lessons learnt this year.</p>
<p>This should be a lesson to all companies needing to switch their business model, it is Vitaly important you keep your business moving but maintain your personality. Moving things online doesn’t mean you need to miss out on the personal touch.</p>

     <p>What is there to say that already hasn’t been covered about the new email service from Basecamp. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now, having made sure I got hold of invites for me and <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/hey-feature-requests-and-improvements-id-love-to-see/">a couple of people</a> I wanted to take a look at it. After initially rejecting it, I have grown to like it and feel like it will make a difference to my email interactions. So if you want to reach out to me, you can always email me <a>greg.morris@hey.com</a>, especially if you’re using the service too, as I would love to know your thoughts.</p><p>This is without discussing the Apple App Store issue that are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch">combined with the launch story</a>, which I don’t really want to comment on because this has been said a hundred times and will continue to be head about every so often for ever more. Some fo this is a valid concern, some of this is marketing and it’s nearly impossible to find the divide, but there has been a resolution for the time being, so we will wait to see what happens.</p><p>There are two things that have really changed the way I use my email and made finding thins so much easier. Hey allows you to rename the subject of emails, not something you would think revolutionary but it makes a bit of difference. I get loads of emails with no subject to being able to rename them makes it look and feel much better — this is completely on your side and doesn’t mess up anything for the other person that emailed you.</p><p>The second is being able to combine threads. I have never found an email client that gets this right and often end up with disjointed emails on the same subject. Or just followups that the other person didn’t reply to and instead sent a new email. In Hey, you can select any emails chains you wish and combine them all together. Agin this is completely on your side, so you can combine those from different people but about the same thing and nothing messes up the other end.</p><p>This is without considering all the features like reply later, tracking blocks and notification customisations. For a great overview check out Matt Birchler’s video below.</p><p>There is so much wrong with email, but there is nothing better. Every time someone tries to come up with something better it become tied down to payments, or locked to services. Hey is both of those things, but still open for people to contact you the same as normal. To me, this service is not perfect, but shows all the signs of making email better. It might not be forever, but at the minute, it’s great.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I have made it my mission to not talk about all the App Store issues surrounding the launch of this app. I might mention it, but it’s a conversation for those that are more educated than I. I have been using the service, however, and after two weeks of use I have some features that I want to share with you that might just make your life easier.</p>
<h2>Imbox</h2>
<p>This is the most obvious feature that is talked about. This is an inbox for you most important things — hence Imbox. Horrible name, great idea. When you get an email from someone for the first time, this is flagged for you to approve, or deny the request to get through.</p>
<p>So only the most important things alert you to their presence. If this is a receipt you can select to deliver this straight to Paper Trail, which stores them all silently, or if this is a marketing email or newsletter this can go to The Feed.</p>
<p>Watch an overview of this <a href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI?t=22">here</a></p>
<h2>Renaming Subjects</h2>
<p>You know those emails you get with no subject, or the email body is in the subject. Well, turns out they annoy all of us, so Hey made is possible to rename the subject of an email, without any input from the persona emailing you.</p>
<p>With a couple of taps you can rename the email, making it easier to find it later, and it doesn’t affect the other side of the conversation.</p>
<p>Watch an overview of this <a href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI?t=1090">here</a></p>
<h2>Merge Threads</h2>
<p>It drives me insane when you get an email about the same thing, but it’s not a reply, or your email app decides it needs its thread (looking at you Apple mail). Will this is fixed too. You can merge threads back together, and even emails chains form different people about the same thing. Again without affecting the other side of the chain.</p>
<p>Watch an overview of this <a href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI?t=1180">here</a></p>
<h2>Clips</h2>
<p>Ever want to remember something like an account number of insertion but don’t want to go searching through all your emails to find it. You can clip text from an email and make it easier to find when you need it.</p>
<p>Watch and overview of this <a href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI?t=1600">here</a></p>
<h2>Notes To Self</h2>
<p>Ever wanted to keep all your information in one place about a subject, but didn’t know how to do it. In Hey, you can make notes in an email chain that only appear to you. So for example you can make notes of telephone conversations with the person or simply notes to cover when replying later.</p>
<p>Watch an overview of this <a href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI?t=2030">here</a></p>
<p>There are loads more features than these but I wanted to give an overview to show this is not just another email service. Many things you can do with Gmail filters, but these above have already come in really useful for me — I even signed up and paid the yearly fee yesterday!</p>

<p>Much like the COVID-19 outbreak, all things seem unimportant any longer. Over the past fortnight since the last edition, at some points it felt like the whole fabric of the world was going to fall apart, but we are getting through things and trying to return to some normal. Of course some things need changing for the world to continue, and although some of us don’t speak up and walk with you, we are behind you every step of the way.</p>
<p>With that said, it doesn’t change the fact that things do continue, and can continue alongside more important issues. It may mean that things become less important but struggles like this should allow us to reframe our existence and find out what really matters to us.</p>
<p>What we once considered smaller things in life have suddenly become critical to people. Walking with my family has become significant to me, as has exercise and cycling specifically that I have spoken about before.</p>
<p>The real dichotomy of the situation is that cycling really shouldn’t matter to me, as with all sport in the current climate, it appears on the surface a pointless endeavour. Nothing is achieved by it, I am not serving a purpose and you could argue it is not essential. But the real beauty of sport and exercise is that taking part is so important to us.</p>
<p>I have seen some usually upbeat and active people going through a painful process of looking at their activities with critical eyes. Whatever your interest they have taken on some weird oxymoronic place in many peoples lives that it is both essential and non-essential simultaneously. Whatever it is that you take part in shouldn’t make you feel bad for carrying on.</p>
<p>This may be the place technology takes for you. You understand that having the latest phone or computer doesn’t matter in the slightest, but also matters a great deal to you.</p>

     <p>When first starting out publishing to the internet I had no idea what I wanted it to be. I had no idea how WordPress, or much of the web, worked and would update my HTML site by building a new page and linking to it from an index.</p><p>It seems strange now looking back at the few months I spent doing that before getting to grips with a CMS. But all I was worried about was writing a post and getting it online. That fact I didn’t even know how to publish to the internet properly but spent so much time making sure I did leave me with nostalgia for simpler times. Times when I thought of myself as a writer, so I did what I though writer did and that was publishing often.</p><p>I wasn’t worried about stats, or SEO, or optimisation of any kind — I just wanted my word on the internet. I wanted for a very long time to join the ranks of a large publication and write away all day until I ran out of ideas — but now I couldn’t think of anything worse.</p><p>Compared that to todays world and you would think things would have improved. Yet whenever I think about writing anything now I am filled with dread unless it heads to my blog. I don’t have to worry about anything that content writers need to worry about, I can write exactly what I want and hit publish.</p><p>As <a href="https://pjrvs.com/about">Paul Jarvis</a> wrote about in his excellent <a href="https://pjrvs.com/blogger">I’d rather be a blogger</a> post, the hassles and strains of content producers should not be any of our concern.

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>At some point each year I fall out of love with my Apple Watch and leave it on its charger. This isn’t a new thing, but I always return after <a href="https://gr36.com/hey-apple-we-need-a-rest/">a week or so rest</a> and kick myself for not keeping up with my activity rings. This time feels different though, and I am starting to wonder if I am about to follow <a href="https://gr36.com/ive-taken-my-watch-off-chis-hannah/">fellow enthusiasts</a> down the route of removing it for good?</p>
<p>The weird thing is, the Apple Watch has been my favourite device for the <a href="https://gr36.com/i-like-this-apple-watch-more-than-i-thought/">past five years</a>. I have written <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/apple-watch/">so many posts about it</a>, and my love of wearing it, above and beyond anything else. Despite a few <a href="https://gr36.com/i-cant-settle-on-an-apple-watch-face/">recent grumbles</a>, I have owned all five iterations of it and gone out of my way to keep one on my wrist at all times. So, it seems even more strange that my love has faded quite dramatically.</p>
<p>I am not sure if it is because of the warmer weather or worrying about tan marks. Working from home could be removing some fo the need for it. To be honest it could be a range of things, but for some reason this keeps happening and this year it has been a few weeks since i continuously put it on each morning. I have been sometimes intentionally putting it on if I want to be contactable but with out my phone, but more often than not it has been left on my bedside table.</p>
<p>The health benefits that filling my rings have been huge. When <a href="https://gr36.com/my-life-beholden-to-three-coloured-circles/">first realising</a> this would make a difference, too now, the three rings have pushed me that bit further to improve my health. Yet I don’t feel the need fill these <a href="https://gr36.com/filling-all-those-rings/">tricolour pests</a> any longer and just cycle when I want (all the time). I am not at the stage where I would get rid of my watch, it gives me the opportunity to not take my phone out and the £5pm is negligible for this convenience.</p>
<p>Currently, it makes an expensive bedside clock and that’s about it.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about this since <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/my-place-in-tech/">Matt Birchler wrote about it</a> a few days ago. Matt has managed to carve out a huge market for what he has to say and often attracts a large audience and invitations to many podcasts. In many ways he does what we lowly blogger dream of, and all whilst not really trying — and being amazingly talented.</p>
<blockquote><p>I hope that I am a sobering voice in the world of tech bloggers. I don’t try to write things that are scandalous or are just written to stir the pot of controversy, and I am not on any company’s list for getting pre-release hardware for reviews, so I don’t tend to go viral.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is it right to think, or worry, about such things instead of just writing? I think it is nice to know where your angle is and stick to your guiding motivation. Otherwise, you can end up being one of those people that moves themselves into camps easily and publish content just to point towards one of them. Things that get picked up and get you loads of views are great, but often only fall into the extremes of arguments. No one is paying attention to the write-ups of their Magic Keyboard in which they are measured, objective and make sound judgements — which is where the issues can start to arise if you’re not careful.</p>
<p>Everyone wants views, clicks, watches, whatever the metric is that defines you, but we must stick to our principles and make sure we find our place in the market whatever we are doing. It’s easy to present them as facts, but presenting our ideas and making them rational and easy to understand is key to staying true to yourself and others. I hope I do a good enough job at this because it is one of my main focuses when hitting publish.</p>

<p>I am at the stage of my life when I really don’t care who did what, and why things happen. I am perfectly ok with companies copying features that make life easier, but are we all ok with blatant design rips offs now?</p>
<p>Admittedly <a href="https://gr36.com/copying-the-notch-is-only-part-of-the-problem/">this</a> isn’t a new thing, and not exclusive to technology products either but such blatantly rip-offs have become so common it is hard to tell the difference. Walking around the streets I see imitation AirPods (the stems are usually longer and thicker) which is part and parcel of the status symbol they have been come attached with. They are sold in shops of a dubious nature for a fraction of the price and of course much of their features missing.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>However, that is nothing when comparing big brands like Oppo and Xiaomi ripping off designs and selling them like everything is ok. Imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery, but copying such horrible designs as the notch in the iPhone X(S) is downright stupid. Yet here we are, with the tech press perfectly ok with it, and nothing done by regulators.</p>
<p>Above is the new Oppo Watch, a product that is undeniably a rip off of the Apple Watch. This in itself doesn’t really matter, after all there isn’t match you can do with a smartwatch, but the watch faces and overall software design is so blatantly copied that it can’t be taken seriously. This should be sold on markets stalls and corner stores, not taken seriously. Yet all the big outlets are reviewing it so this must be an acceptable practice now.</p>

    <time datetime="2020-05-20 13:42:54 &#43;0000">20 May 2020</time>
  </div>
  </div>
<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Since sharing my <a href="https://gr36.com/todoist-organise-my-life/">Todoist set up</a> and how I get things done loads of people have given me some ideas and shared their experience. <a href="https://twitter.com/MrChrisJWilson/status/1262601218674786304?s=20">One of which</a> I wanted to try to help out with, and that is the natural language input. This feels amazingly natural to me, but for some feels like a bit of a code — so let’s crack it together.</p>
<p>On Mac, you can use <a href="https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/115001745265-Task-Quick-Add">Control+Command+A</a> to open quick add. Or to start your entry, regardless of platform, just tap or click on the Plus icon. Quick Add is the fastest way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a new task</li>
<li>Set a due date and time for a task</li>
<li>Attach a label to a task</li>
<li>Set the priority level for a task</li>
<li>Add a task to a project</li>
<li>Assign a task to a collaborator</li>
</ul>
<h2>Date And Time</h2>
<p>If you can’t crack this bit then there might not be much help for you, as it’s that easy. Simply write out when you want to complete the task exactly how you would say it. For example, “tomorrow at 4pm” or “every other Tuesday starting March 3rd”.</p>
<p><code>Call mum next wednesday at 2pm</code></p>
<p>This can be as simple or as powerful as you need it to be. Most tasks you add will have a context date e.g. next Friday, or an actual date 2nd March, but some don’t fit into this pattern. Luckily, Todoist understands even complicated expressions and will interrupt what you need pretty much all the time.</p>
<h2>Repeating Tasks</h2>
<p>For things that crop up regularly, or just every so often, you will soon get to grips with typing ‘every’ to get these set up. Every is the start of all things repeating and is really helpful for even the most complex things.</p>
<p><code>Call mum every wednesday</code></p>
<p>But it doesn’t have to stop there, you can arrange tasks for whenever suits you.</p>
<p><code>Call mum every other week day</code></p>
<p><code>Call mum every wedneday june 2nd to july 1st</code></p>
<p>For those tasks that you want to happen a specific period after you complete it put in an !.</p>
<p><code>Call mum every! week</code></p>
<p>This will set up a task to call mum exactly a week after you complete the last item. You can of course use every! Day, month, year — depends on how often you want to do it.</p>
<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>
<h2>Labels</h2>
<p>Labels help me highlight something that I want to know at specific times. For example, I have a morning tag, and a someday tag, so I don’t need to give these due dates or times, but I can find these tasks easily when required.</p>
<p>To add a tag just put a @ before the name.</p>
<p><code>Call mum next wednesday @morning</code></p>
<p>You can make these as complex or as easy as you like. Some people like to have tags for tasks they need to do while driving, or when they have a spare 5 minutes.</p>
<p><code>Call mum next wednesday @driving</code></p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-05-20-at-14.12.45-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9f38a405b9.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 05 20 at 14 12 45 1" width="595" height="91" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Priority</h2>
<p>I have never adopted priorities in either email flags or my tasks, but it helps hugely if you want to sift through all your tasks and really get down to how important things are. To assign a priority (flag) just type p1, p2 or p3.</p>
<p><code>Call mum next wednesday p1</code></p>
<p>So, when your tasks are listed in Today view or Upcoming view they will be sorted by priority so you can get the most important things done first.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>Projects are the main sorting point for most users set up in Todoist. They can be used in a variety of ways to highlight long-term project or simply having an area to assign task to — such as home and work.</p>
<p>To move a task to a project you simply put a # before it. You can type all of it out or just the first few letters and then tap on the suggestion.</p>
<p><code>Call Mum next wednesday #home</code></p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Todoist-Quick-Add-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8313fcffd9.jpg" alt="Todoist Quick Add 1" width="2000" height="955" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Collaborator</h2>
<p>If you need some help, or just want to allocate your task to someone else that you work with, you can do this by typing a + and then their name. Again type it all out, or just the first few letters and then tap their name in the popup suggestion.</p>
<p><code>Call Mum next wednesday +Jon</code></p>
<p>This is only possible in shared projects so make sure you have assigned the correct project first. The above example would not work, but the following <em>will</em> if you share a home project with Jon.</p>
<p><code>Call mum next wednesday #home +Jon</code></p>
<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br /><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8335452151565777" data-ad-slot="6575033860"></ins><br /><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>
<h2>Linking it all</h2>
<p>The real power of all these ‘codes’ is that you can link them all together and make powerful but quick entires into your task list. This rapidly becomes second nature and allows you to brain dump effortlessly with minimal sorting afterwards.</p>
<p>So setting a reminder to call mum at 7pm every 7 days for 8 weeks, adding it to your routines task and attaching a personal tag becomes</p>
<p><code>call mum every! week until 8th july #routines @personal</code></p>
<p>You’ll be using <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">Todoist</a> as power user in no time and setting it up to remind you of everything you need. Why not <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">sign up</a> and give it a shot as I’d love to see your setups or how you use Todoist to help you get things done.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>If you are a <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/cycling/">regular reader</a>, or subscribed <a href="https://gr36.com/greg-thinks-things-5/">the newsletter</a>, you will have noticed a change in me. It has been COVID–19 that has compelled people that start exercising or change the way they do it, but mine was a pretty annoying and painful injury. At the time it didn’t feel like it, but I am glad to say it is the best thing that has happened to me for a long time.</p>
<p>For more than 18 months I have been struggling with my health and fitness. I have always been pretty active, but unfortunately picking up injuries easily and suffering because I couldn’t exercise as much. Around 6 miles (ca. 10 km) into an otherwise average run my calf twinged horribly. I stopped to try to stretch it out, but to no relief and from lack of other options I had to walk/run/hobble the rest of the way home agonising.</p>
<p>This resulted in my calf being torn badly and I never really recovered fully until recently. As much as my wife tried to convince me this was because I am getting old, I found myself getting pretty upset about it. I couldn’t do much exercise for weeks, the only thing I could stand was indoor cycling and found that tedious, so didn’t do it very often. When I did get back to running I was very limited to around 5k before it started to hurting again.</p>
<p>I tried to push myself too much every so often which resulted in not being able to walk well or having to stay off it completely. Couple this with the associated issues with trying to recover, my gait was really affected and I started to get knee and lower back pain due to what I think was subconsciously compensating. This all came to a head just after Christmas with a nasty hip injury that made it difficult to walk sometimes.</p>
<p>So at the start of March, with no other choice I reluctantly pulled my road bike out the garage, dusted it off and started riding.</p>
<p>I absolutely hated every second of it. It was windy, cold, and I was desperately out of shape due to not all the injuries. I eventually managed to puff and blow myself around 16 km. I was annoyed at myself for being so unfit again, but buoyed at the realisation that I had no hip pain for the first time in weeks.</p>
<p>So, I got on again the next day, and the next day, and the day after that. Actually, I think I had some rest days in there at first — but you get the idea. Pushing myself a little further and working on my technique. Beginning to watch videos on beginners tips, and reading advice on bike servicing, cycling crept into my life.</p>
<p>I didn’t know then I was hooked, but when out for a ride a few days later I stumbled on hill that took everything out of me to get to the top. Upon and conquering it I knew this was it, something clicked and I fell in love.</p>
<p>Cycling has allowed me to do more than I ever imagined. It gives me not only a ridiculous workout with a lot less stress on my body, but it gives me time away. I ride for around 90mins each day and that’s my alone time with the world. Its made me happier, fitter, and a better runner than I ever could have been without getting on my bike. Getting injured was annoying, painful and slightly depressing, but I am better for it.<!--kg-card-end: html--></p>

Given the reality that most of our homes are filled with more possessions than at any point in human history (even after 2 months of stores being closed), buying stuff from the store is no longer about survival for most of us.</p></blockquote>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>So. No apologies here, but I ripped off this idea directly from Matt Birchler’s write-up <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/how-i-use-things-3-to-organize-my-life/">on his Things set up</a>. Even though he is a strong believer in the ability of Things, and also everyone <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1261314996048363521">in the replies</a>seems to think the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/todoist-my-new-app-to-get-things-done/">Todoist</a> design is trash, I think very much that we have the same outlook on GTD. The basis of this revolves around “offloading your brain” so you can focus on other things.</p>
<p>I never set levels of tasks that I <em>HAVE</em> to get done each day, but I <em>DO</em> aim to get 3 main things ticked off each working day. This set up has been how I get everything done daily and also why I forget loads of meaningless stuff. I would love you all to give <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">Todoist a try here</a>. This isn’t a GTD set up, but it’s my set up and it all starts with the Inbox.</p>
<h2 id="inbox">Inbox</h2>
<p>More or less everything starts life in here. All my tasks from heavy-duty projects to simple reminders start life as a string of text in my inbox. Having tried almost all the major task managers, I am sure most people would agree that Todoist does it best for just dumping everything in and this is the reason why I struggle to take to any other app.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" title="Todoist-Setup-Screenshots-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8a6533ba1a.jpg" alt="Todoist Setup Screenshots 1" /></figure>
<p>Whenever any tasks arise I use the Mac shortcut or the widget on iOS to quickly add it to my inbox. If the task can be done straight away and within 5 minutes this is the only time it doesn’t get added because I will complete that task straight away. If I know when it needs to be done I can allocate the due date then in natural language and forget about it.</p>
<p>The power of being able to just type out something like “follow up with Geoff in 2 months #work” and never have to think about it again is the biggest thing that improves my productivity and also my mental health.</p>
<h2 id="moving-and-tagging">Moving And Tagging</h2>
<p>I have a recurring task to sort my Inbox at 7:30 every morning which is usually the time I am sitting down at my desk. I tried doing this as my last thing each day but it didn’t stick. My habits dictate I never leave work without having completed everything or moved things to the following day so this became the best way for me to pick anything up that has been missed or cropped up later.</p>
<p>The next stage of my to-dos life begins when this notification goes off. I then go through all of my tasks, allocating them due dates and times and moving them to projects. As with the Inbox, if I can do this straight away and within 5–10 minutes I will do this task and cross it off. So, not every task lives a long life or makes it any further than my inbox.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>I don’t use Projects as Todoist intend, or indeed how any task manager apps think you will use it. This is simply because I never really have many large scale projects to complete. I have just a few that I use more like areas that my task relates to. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-Off tasks – anything that I need to get done and that’s the end of it. Most home things end up here.</li>
<li>Work – most of my stuff ends up here, small or large tasks to get done. Going forward my team will move to a shared Task managing platform, so we can allocate things, but at the moment this is just me.</li>
<li>Routines – Anything that is reoccurring such as put the bin out, read my meters, set my Strava goals for the week.</li>
<li>Creative – any writing tasks or newsletter projects I want to complete. These usually contain a link to the relevant Ulysses Sheet.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" title="Todoist-Upcoming-Mac-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d86b4e6789.jpg" alt="Todoist Upcoming Mac 1" /></figure>
<h2 id="the-upcoming-screen">The Upcoming Screen</h2>
<p>This is where I spend most of my time, with the upcoming screen (previously next 7 days) of the Mac app open. This gives me an overview of the next few days, and allows me to put in times if I need to and arrange my day fully. There is never a time that a task doesn’t have a due date, so this screen gives me everything.</p>
<p>I am not afraid to push something if other things crop up so from this screen I can just drag a task to another day, but also add tasks for other days effortlessly. Before the upcoming screen I found myself switching between areas depending on what I was doing, so now things are much more streamlined. I have a calendar subscription <a href="https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/208789889-Use-Todoist-with-your-calendar">set up for an overview</a> if I am not sat at my desk, this works really well with the Stock iOS app.</p>
<h2 id="little-tricks">Little Tricks</h2>
<p>I have picked up some little things over the few years I have been using Todoist that really help me. These don’t fit into any area but are worth sharing anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li>Event Tickets – if I am going anywhere I save a PDF of the tickets (either the email or the web conformation) attach this to a reminder that pops up and the event start time. That way I am not searching my emails when I get there.</li>
<li>Morning Tag – This is a new one stolen from Matt, but is working very well. Instead of trying to guess times, anything that I want to do first thing I allocate a Morning tag to.</li>
<li>Drag in Emails – If you use Apple Mail on Mac or iPadOS you can <a href="https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/206522639-How-can-I-use-Todoist-with-Apple-Mail-">drag in an email as a Todoist item</a>and it will link straight to it. Mind Blown.</li>
<li>Browser extension – <a href="https://doist.com/blog/hidden-features-todoist/#add_article">Get this</a> to save any Safari links you need to refer to.</li>
<li>Due dates based on last completed date – If you want to set a reoccurring reminder for a length of time after that last one use a ! After the every. For example, “task every! week” will create a task one week after you complete the last one.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>
<p>There are a few things that I do desire from Things. None of these are critical, I wouldn’t say I miss them, but would help for my specific use case.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create Project – There are times when I create items that then turn into a much larger project. I currently have to copy these into a new project, but in Things the option exists to create one from an item.</li>
<li>Someday – I long for this to be an option in Todoist. I just like to dump longer term things into here and leave them to plan later. I have tried to do something similar with tags but it just never really stuck.</li>
<li>Start Dates – oh boy this is a big one. I want to be able to set a start date for some tasks that take a while or are easier done slowly over time such as writing my newsletter. Currently, I have to set a “start newsletter” task and then another “finish newsletter” task. I would love to set it as a current task or ongoing task in Upcoming.</li>
<li>Calendar Items – Another big one I would love is to see upcoming calendar events in the Upcoming screen, so I can work my tasks around meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The End</p>
<p>There are a ridiculous number of apps and services I have tried, and I still get suckered into new ones all the time. However, Todoist works well for me, and has <a href="https://gr36.com/todoist-my-new-app-to-get-things-done/">done for years</a>. My set up has gone through so many changes that it doesn’t resemble anything like what I started with and will probably change in the future. The great thing is that <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">Todoist is available everywhere</a>, and is improving all the time.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">Todoist</a> and share your set up <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@gr36%20here's%20my%20Todoist%20set%20up">with me</a>.</p>

<p>I think I hate the internet. I mean it’s great as an idea, and all the things we can do with it are fantastic. As with everything it is the humans that access it that spoil everything. With great communication tools, comes a great influx of idiots, many that think their opinion, however toxic, should be shoved in peoples faces if they like it or not.</p>
<p>Matt Birchler published a few graphs (<a href="https://gr36.com/charty-app-overview/">not sure if made with Charty</a>) around COVID cases in the US a few days ago. It was a great post, very insightful and well thought out, yet the first thought I had when reading it was “I bet he’ll regret writing that”. I expected the reply guys to pile in on mass and argue about it.</p>
<p>There are numerous times I have had an idea for a post and not written it because I simply can’t be doing with people tweeting back at me. I am all up for debate, but Twitter especially seems to stimulate a certain type of ‘person’. I say person but I think some are bots, or fake accounts, and have some kind of usage beyond just annoying people. However some of this is people, people that I used to respect.</p>
<p>The replies to this post were not too bad, but Matt wrote the next day <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/a-perpetual-hate-machine/">about his struggles</a> with fools online. Receiving death threats because of comparisons between Pixel and iPhone cameras is wildly insane, but shouldn’t stop me from writing anything. I <em>might</em> regret writing a post, but I <em>do</em> experience regret at not writing things often.</p>

<p>I know exactly what you’re thinking. What exactly is this thing and how can I use this with my iPad? Well, this is something completely different, something I use for my new love cycling, but it’s still a gadget and well worth a review. So here are my thoughts on the Wahoo Element Bolt from my relatively new to cycling point of view.</p>
<p>There are loads of opinions out there already about what bit of kit to get to display your cycling info. Wahoo Element Bolt reviews are mainly written by almost professional cyclists, so I hoping my opinions and thoughts fit in somewhere for those of us not putting out unbelievable times. Indeed technology like this isn’t new, but its leaps and bounds above what was capable only a few years ago. From my novice experience of riding, this is my first computer since those cheap little boxes that you had to attach a magnet to your spokes, but when considering upping your game and spending a bit more time in the saddle there are only two things to consider.</p>
<h2>Tracking All The Things</h2>
<p>Do you want to track everything with your phone, and if not, do you buy a Garmin or a Wahoo? The more established Garmin has plenty of fans, but the real attraction for me was the huge battery life leap from the Wahoo, and the relatively cheep price. Yes this thing is going to set you back around £190, but it gives you an all singing all dancing cycle computer that should last you years.</p>
<p>The normal metrics are on board. Screens can be customised to show you speed, time, distance, power, heart rate, elevation and many more. So purists can see this live, review it later and export all the information their heart desires. That wasn’t why I bought this though. I am pretty sure that’s not why anyone would spend this kind of money on a training aid, because it can be done cheaper. Really the beauty of the Wahoo Element Bolt is its integrations with tools that make your cycling better.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Wahoo-Element-Bolt-Screens-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0ca2636195.jpg" alt="Wahoo Element Bolt Screens 1" width="1157" height="372" border="0" /></p>
<p>It offers turn by turn navigation, live tracking links to share with friends, route planning and wireless connection to a whole range of other products. This little black box has very quickly become one of my favourite things. Not because it gives me power output and speed information, because it lets me plan my route ahead of time and tells me where to go.</p>
<p>It has taken me from doing the same old routes to exploring more and finding my way around with confidence. I knew my local back roads very little considering I have lived here for more than 10 years, but using the companion app or online services live Strava, I can plot out a ride and complete it with much less stress. I am sure all the analytics displayed are important to those more deeply into cycling, but that’s just not me at the moment.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Image-15-05-2020-08-39-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5d6cfa2a36.jpg" alt="Image 15 05 2020 08 39 1" width="2000" height="955" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Smart Connection</h2>
<p>Initial setup of the Wahoo Element Bolt requires very little user input, but it does require a smartphone to set it up on first boot. After using it for signing in and setting up, you will also need the companion app connected if you want to customise anything. This wont be an issue for almost anyone but unfortunately as with all companion apps, it is terribly designed. Thankfully the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elemnt-companion-app-for-wahoo/id1049469683?mt=8">Element app</a> is very easy to use and understand. Here you can also connect your Wahoo Element Bolt to other services such as Strava, Komoot and even Apple Health on iOS.</p>
<p>You can also connect the Wahoo Element to other Bluetooth and WiFi extras such as heart rate monitors, power sensors and loads of other options. If like me you have the Shimano DI2 with wireless you can even set up the two buttons on the shifters to change pages on the Wahoo. You can connect it to just about anything and any service imaginable.</p>
<p>Using Apple Health to triage all of your rides is a great tool, and counts towards your daily move goal as long as you sync through Strava. For some reason I couldn’t get the Wahoo Element app to give Apple Health any calorie information, yet Strava does <a href="https://gr36.com/strava-record-calories-apple-health/">after a bit of setup</a>. Unless you need to change the screens of the unit or check for an update reliance on the smartphone app is minimal if you use other services such as Strava. Allowing customisation through the app is a clever decision and removes the need for a touchscreen on the unit meaning interaction is done by good old trusty buttons.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Wahoo-Element-Bolt-Review-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8351033557.jpg" alt="Wahoo Element Bolt Review 1" width="2000" height="1125" border="0" /></p>
<p>This is great if you live somewhere like the UK and need to wear gloves often. The three buttons on the front and two on the side allow for changing pages of information or zooming in and out of the displayed navigation map. The screen is bright and easy to read whatever the weather. Despite being criticised as only being black and white I think this is the right decision for ease of use.</p>
<p>If you are the type of rider that takes your phone out with you so you stay connected, the Wahoo Element Bolt will also flash up messages and phone calls if you wish. Meaning you will still be contactable when out and about. The screen will show a preview of any messages, with customisable sound and LED alerts to something that needs your attention.</p>
<p>The strip of LEDs across the top can also be customised to alert you to different kinds of things. From Strava sections, to navigation alerts or your training metrics you want to highlight. This unit really does have it all for beginners to elite athletes.</p>
<h2>Better By Design</h2>
<p>Wahoo have made several design choices when producing the Element Bolt that all play together to build a complete package. Decisions such as the black and white screen don’t detract from the unit in anyway, save battery life and increase the visibility when out cycling. Something that may seem like a ‘con’ when compared to much of the Garmin range is actually the right decision.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="bolt_aero-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a3d3bd4696.jpg" alt="Bolt aero 1" width="600" height="294" border="0" /></p>
<p>This rings even more true when you consider that battery life is absolutely insane. I have never used an alternative, however Wahoo claim it is up to 300% better than the Garmin 520 and even a 3 hour ride while navigating clips the battery by only 40%. Given the size of the Wahoo Element Bolt, that is pretty amazing battery life.</p>
<p>Wahoo have also thought about the Aerodynamics of the unit when designing. Claiming 50% less drag than competitors, with a sleek and all in one deign that clips safe and secure to its holder with zero fuss. I’m not looking to shave seconds off my ride here, but I appreciate something well designed and doesn’t look like you’ve attached a huge tablet to your handlebars. The Wahoo Element Bolt will pretty much go unnoticed when you don’t need it, but provide everything when you do.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With all of this packed into hardware that Wahoo claims has 50 percent less drag than a Garmin Edge 520, and triple the battery life there isn’t a lot not to love. If your buying this to shave off a few seconds in a time trial, its got you covered. If indeed your training had reached it peak and you need another push forward, this will help. However if you need something to help you get out and about a bit more and help you along the way as an enthusiast then the Wahoo Element Bolt is pretty perfect too.</p>

    <h1 class="p-name">How To Set Up Strava To Record Calories In Apple Health</h1>
</a>
 
<div class="datetime" style="font-size: 70%">

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>After switching from recording my cycling on the Apple Watch to a <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/wahoo-element-bolt/">Wahoo Element</a> Bolt my activity levels seemed to suck. After previously smashing my move goals I was left short on some days even after a reasonable ride. Simply because Strava wasn’t calculating my calories and it took me ages to find out why.</p>
<p>After a few days of Googling around and finding all sorts of weird information I <a href="https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360039627911-Apple-Watch-App-not-counting-calories">eventually discovered a fix</a>. I tracked the issue down to a really simple one, but something that isn’t immediately obvious — you need to make sure that Strava has your weight and your bikes weight recorded.</p>
<p>You can only do all of this on the website and not the mobile app, so make sure you can log in on the web. Your weight is changeable in the app to your profile, but you can’t add or customise your gear for some reason. You will need to log in online, create your bike, and make sure you also give it a weight. A rough guess is fine but you can usually track down the correct weight with a quick search of the manufactures website.</p>
<p>Once this is competed your new runs and bike rides will contain calorie information that will be passed to Apple Health. If you want to get this for older rides, just tap edit activity and then save it again. This will pass the last few days worth of activity back to Apple Health but not all of it, and it’s temperamental at best with syncing.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" title="Image-15-05-2020-08-52-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/871c0624ed.jpg" alt="Image 15 05 2020 08 52 1" /></figure>
<p><br />This should mean you are getting all of the credit for your rides going forward. It’s surprising how addictive filling your rings on your Apple Watch is, and Apple Health makes it easy to share your activity data if a medical issue requires it. Strava is great for keeping all your rides logged, but keep it in other places too just in case you want to switch at a later date.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s been more than 14 days since I received my Magic Keyboard. The time has flown by and I hadn’t even realised it had been this long until I checked back on my post history. Two weeks that seems like the blink of an eye, and the biggest compliment I can give this keyboard is I have not regretted it once.</p>
<p>I sat down to write a full review about a week ago after seeing a few start to pop up such as <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/magic-keyboard-review/">Matt Birchler’s post</a> and really struggled to write it. You see, the best thing about a bit of technology that is exactly what you want, is that nothing stands out. There are no downsides, there are no emotions and very little to say bar “its great”.</p>
<p>My second problem with writing a full review is that I wrote so many words (1143) in <a href="https://gr36.com/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-forst-impressions/">my hands on</a> and very few have changed. I’ve never written so many after so little time before, simply because all of the feels I had about the device came at once. After all, this is only a keyboard, what is there to write about?</p>
<p>In fact there are loads of things I can talk about, which I already have, but things boil down to only a few points you need to consider if deciding to buy this thing.</p>
<h2>The Weight</h2>
<p>It is surprisingly heavy. Using it does bump the weight of the overall device to around the same as a MacBook. In exchange it is perfectly balanced and feels like a proper keyboard (more on this in a moment). It sits on my lap on the couch or in bed and gives me a laptop when I need it.</p>
<h2>Ease Of Use</h2>
<p>The keyboard is ridiculously easy to remove when needed. Mine has spent its time unfolded on my desk when I am using my iPad as a tablet. The magnets are safe and secure, but easy to snap off when you need to, giving a much better experience than keyboard cases that clip all the way around the body. You wont want to keep it attached all the time, and you wont have to.</p>
<p>I moaned a little about a function row of keys, but haven’t needed them at all. There may not be a key to adjust the key brightness but I am happy to report there doesn’t need to be. I have never ventured into settings once in any light condition and trust the software to do its thing.</p>
<h2>Typing</h2>
<p>The most important thing is what it feels like. I have never not liked the Smart Folio or Smart Keyboard before it, but the Magic Keyboard is a different beast entirely. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/the_ipad_magic_keyboard">Gruber summed it up best</a> when he described previous attempts iPad keyboards as covers you can type on. There was nothing wrong with these versions, I used them very happily for a long time. Whereas this is a proper, full sized keyboard with backlight and decent key travel. It is a delight to type on. I would be hard pushed to find fault with the typing experience, it even rivals the Mac Magic Keyboards which are my favourite for writing.</p>
<h2>Wants For The Future</h2>
<p>There are very few complaints from me, this simply doesn’t feel like a first generation device like it should. Many of my immediate concerns have gone, and even those pointed towards the <a href="https://thedent.net/grimegate/">outer material and GrimeGate</a> are short lived and the pretty much the same as previous versions.</p>
<p>If i could be really picky, I’d love for the charging port to also be able to transfer data, but that’s a small want. All these words are to say that i am very happy with my purchase, the Magic Keyboard has meant I have ditched my MacBook and made me fall in love with the iPad again — well done Apple.</p>

     <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>If you’ve followed me for a while, you will already know my love of <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/automation/">iOS automation</a>. I am not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8raOG7HXJoCUygx219fU4A">Chris Lawley</a> level of obsessed, but anything to make my daily life easier and I am all in! Shortcuts (and before that Workflow) is by far my favourite app for doing this, but the real beauty of Shortcuts is all the apps it plugs into. Almost everything on your home-screen can be automated, and a whole lot more. New app Charty is aiming to remove the hassle of creating graphs and charts, and launches today.</p>
<p>This is one of those apps that at first you dismiss, but when actually looking around the app you realise just how helpful it can be. That’s because developer Rodrigo Araújo has thought about almost every aspect of the app. Building on the success of his first app <a href="https://chatstats.app/">ChartStat</a> he aims to make it easy for everyone to visualise any kind of data.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Image-06-05-2020-07-57-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/31f2dfd6b3.jpg" alt="Image 06 05 2020 07 57 1" width="599" height="286" border="0" />There are 27 examples already included in the app ready to be imported into Shortcuts. These powerful Shortcuts can plot data you probably already have on your phone but don’t really look at that often. Displaying them in any of the available 5 different types – bar, line, scatter, pie and donut.</p>
<p>From there it is amazingly easy to create powerful algorithms that process and create your visualisations from inside Shortcuts. The really great things is that now you can begin to not only collect and store data using Shortcuts, but also combine it with utilities such as <a href="https://datajar.app/">DataJar</a> to build really powerful tools.</p>
<p>I have been using this quite a bit to plot out my heart rate changes over time, and my distance cycled due to my attempt to get fitter. The graphs in Apple Health are very restrictive so I am over the moon this app makes it easy for me to compare and highlight fitness issues. The graphs are amazingly customisable so I see exactly what I am exporting. I can then send these wherever I like to save and refer back to later.</p>
<p>In my limited use the app has already proved really helpful. Everyone should give it a go just for the amazing alternative icons. With that said I expect to see <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/update-on-the-ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-charging-speed-45w-charger-tested/">Matt Birchler</a> really putting this to work over the next few weeks — he loves a graph!</p>
<p>Charty is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/charty-for-shortcuts/id1494386093">available now</a> for free with 4 Shortcut actions available — New Chart, Add Series To Chart, Delete Chart and Get Information From All Chart. You can upgrade the app for a one off payment of $4.99 to get extra shortcuts actions as well as a whole load of extras, but if you purchase this within the first month of release it will only be $2.99.</p>

  </div>
<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I know Apple marketing is great but we need to have a little chat about the Magic Keyboard because I think they may have sold you a lie. You see, despite it being pretty great the keyboard Apple sold you isn’t really magic.</p>
<p>I am not sure what you expected to happen when you attached a keyboard complete with backlight keys and a trackpad to an iPad but it was never going to turn it into a Mac. The way that some people have spoken about the keyboard seems that they expected some kind of OTA update once you connected it, and that the iPad all of sudden wasn’t an iPad anymore.</p>
<p>Yet here we are debating everything negative about a device that isn’t supposed to do what you want it to. While the comparisons to the surface are somewhat valid, to say that Windows tablets do it better is simply not true. Windows tablets are laptops stuffed into a tablet form fact and made to work — whereas the iPad is the reverse. It’s pretending to be a Laptop, but its not pretending to be a Mac.</p>
<p>I can’t help but think that if the iPad was made by someone else we wouldn’t even be making these comparisons to a Mac, and indeed that some of the evangelical aspects of iOS would be removed. As this <a href="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1255718156238118913?s=21">eloquent tweet storm</a> points out there are some points that feel like you have to agree to an iPad philosophy. That in order to really ‘get’ the iPad you have to devote your life to praising its positives and shift your whole workflow in order to use it Working on iOS feels like a badge of honour that people wear, and become strangely evangelical at every point.</p>
<p>The fact remains. Are you making the iPad a worse tablet because you attach a Magic Keyboard. Of course you are. You’re attaching a keyboard that effectively turns the iPad into a laptop and some how that is surprising? Yet you can remove the tablet easily and use it as a tablet once again. If your expecting a keyboard that is lighter and can remain on when you want to use it as a tablet — good news <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MXNK2B/A/smart-keyboard-folio-for-ipad-pro-11%E2%80%91inch-2nd-generation-british-english">Apple sell that kind of keyboard</a> too.</p>
<p>As the old saying goes a “Jack of all trades is a master of none”. Attaching a keyboard to the iPad does not make it a master Laptop, better options exist. Attaching a Pencil does not make it a master drawing tablet, better options exist. Plugging the iPad into an exerting display… you get the idea. The iPad cannot be all things to all people. But its doing a bloody good job of giving people a tablet when they want it. Turning into a sudo-laptop when they want it, and also being capable of ridiculously powerful tasks when you need them.</p>

<p>The problem is don’t think this makes any difference to users. They just ignore it and carry in regardless. Even If (and that’s a very big if) Google got fined for this, it’s such a small hit to take to their bottom line it’s almost unnoticeable when they look to gain millions of users a week.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong this is a. absolutely deplorable tactic by Google, but one I am not surprised in the slightest. Google’s business model is to sell you stuff, or sell you Google services, which it then uses to sell you stuff. So this shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p>

<p>Updated: Added in non-jQuery code snippet</p>
<p>This problem is a reasonably simple one if you know what you are doing with writing Javascript. Unfortunately, I am not, and this feels like an issue that shouldn’t need some script, but here we are.</p>
<p>After loads of Googling, looking at Github Gist, and trial and error, I finally found a solution to opening new links in a new tab thanks to <a href="https://www.insidersbyte.com/open-external-links-in-a-new-tab-by-default-ghost/">InsidersByte</a>.</p>
<p>As they point out you can do this with markdown or adding in <code>target=_blank</code> to the end of each Url, but who has time for that? So add this into the footer of your site.</p>
<p>With jQuery</p>
<pre><code class="language-jQuery">
var links = document.links;</code></pre>
<p>for (var i = 0, linksLength = links.length; i &lt; linksLength; i++) {
 if (links[i].hostname != window.location.hostname) {
 links[i].target = '_blank';
 }
}</p>
<p>non-jQuery</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
 var links = document.querySelectorAll(‘a’);
 links.forEach((link) =&gt; {
 var a = new RegExp(‘/’ + window.location.host + ‘/’);
 if(!a.test(link.href)) {
 link.addEventListener(‘click’, (event) =&gt; {
 event.preventDefault();
 event.stopPropagation();
 window.open(link.href, ‘_blank’);
 });
 }
 });
</code></pre>
<p>You could do this in your theme template if you like, but the easiest way is to head to your dashboard, and then Settings &gt; Code Injection. Copy and paste in the code and remember to save!</p>
<p>Reload your site, and you should be sorted.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I fancy myself as a bit of an enlightened person, and spend a lot of <a href="https://gr36.com/i-spend-too-much-time-alone/">time on my own</a> thinking. Running ideas through my head and working out conclusions, or simply letting my imagination run wild. This works pretty well for creativity, and is where most of my blog posts come from. I enjoy it so much that I’m convinced boredom should be a skill learnt in school.</p>
<p>Whilst walking the dog, running, or after everyone else has gone to sleep I often just sit alone with my thoughts and ideas. Sounds weird doesn’t it, but during one such period of silence I was thinking about my thoughts and decisions on the <a href="https://gr36.com/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-forst-impressions/">Magic Keyboard</a> and the criticism faced. It’s great to test technology and see where it fits into your life, I quite often make room in order to fit them in, but it’s just as valid to decide they are simply not for you.</p>
<p>So when I came across a post by <a href="https://nahumck.me/this-is-not-for-me/">Tim Nuhumk on the Magic Keyboard</a> I was surprised how many words went half way towards apologising for his thoughts, and I would presume there may have been a worry about some backlash against him. I love Tim, and all of his writing, but his thoughts expressed in his posts are not him as a person.</p>
<p>How many times do you hold ideas and beliefs so rigidly that they become part of your being. Defending them with the same visceral energy that could be called fight or flight. This is not the case with Tim’s post above, this was purely where the idea sprung from whilst thinking about Apple related topics. Infact I am certainly guilty of this more often than not. Just because someone is testing or even better breaking down your ideas, does not mean they are breaking down you. You are not your thoughts, beliefs or ideas.</p>
<p>An idea becomes stronger when you hold it up to be tested. When pressure is applied and the idea resists is when they grow, develop and improve. If they do indeed break, that’s perfectly ok. You do not need to hold your ideas so close and tenderly as if they are glass, because then they will surely break.</p>
<p>If others test your ideas and beliefs they are not testing you as a person. It’s perfectly ok to have apposing views and still like the other person — in fact some of my closest friends are so close because they give me different ideas and apposing view points. Make your circle as diverse and as interesting as possible and you will be a better person because of it. Separate yourself from your ideas and you will feel much better.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I guess my posts over the past few weeks may have <a href="https://twitter.com/crumpy/status/1252919281496530945?s=20">seemed like a reversal</a> after my rage <a href="https://gr36.com/today-is-the-day-i-quit-the-ipad/">quitting of the iPad</a> 6 months ago. Since announcing the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/03/apple-unveils-new-ipad-pro-with-lidar-scanner-and-trackpad-support-in-ipados/">new version</a> alongside the Magic Keyboard Apple got me interested again, and wondering if I could return. So I guess I should explain myself.</p>
<p>In actual fact I never stopped <a href="https://gr36.com/the-ipad-goes-full-circle/">owning an iPad</a>, I just didn’t want to work on one any longer. Indeed the upgrades to the iPad Pro are unimportant and haven’t changed the iPad much at all. I <em>was</em> interested in the <a href="https://gr36.com/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-forst-impressions/">Magic Keyboard</a> though and picked up a 2018 iPad Pro to go with it despite the Magic Keyboard shipping much later. For the majority of this time it has been a consumption device and living alongside my iMac as a sidecar screen or displaying extra info.</p>
<p>In order to see if anything has changed in my thoughts, I went back and pulled the most important statements out of the old post and compared them to my feelings now.</p>
<blockquote><p>During my time working on the iPad I always needed a Mac around to podcast and edit things properly – you know do real work.</p></blockquote>
<p>I no longer podcast at all and have sold all of my equipment. So I need a Mac around even less than before. Currently I am working from my home on my work iMac Pro – but going forward I don’t want a desktop around when I hopefully <a href="https://gr36.com/my-set-up-and-want-for-more/">change up my set up as planned</a>. So this point no longer applies to me, but still does to some. The iPad still needs to improve these ‘Pro’ apps to get everything done.</p>
<blockquote><p>Then iOS13 arrived. I cant point to one specific event or one particular bug, but iOS13 has been like death by a million paper cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Things have improved in this department. Sync of my Apple Notes and random app crashes have moved forward considerably. iOS13 is still not up to scratch in my opinion. Still retaining things like the annoying rotation bug for iPads — but it is not nearly as unreliable as it was. I still have some issues placing my trust in Apple to maintain this, simply because I rely so much on apps and Shortcuts. It takes a while to win this trust back and invest in iOS again, but things look positive.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is all after spending weeks getting my head around the new multitasking and app pairing because they changed the way the iPad worked AGAIN.</p></blockquote>
<p>Please don’t change things again Apple. Not having to reach up to the screen when using a keyboard helps dramatically though and this is one of the big improvement that I am really happy about. No more shoulder pain when trying to use it as a laptop.</p>
<blockquote><p>The iPad lost its way somewhere in the last year or so and become a device that isn’t fit for me any more.</p></blockquote>
<p>The iPad is still a bit confused to me. Apple are not really sure what they want it to be but I have a feeling things are going to become clearer over the next 6months to a year. As more apps become universal and some of the line moves to ARM things will become easier to work out. I didn’t immediately spring for a 2020 iPad and picked up a 2018 version for a fraction of the price because my confidence is still shaken.</p>
<p>So although I am using an iPad Pro again very little of my opinions has changed. I might be using an iPad again but I am not putting my faith in working on one, yet.</p>

<p>When is it too early to give your opinions on a product? This seems a pretty blurred line. Dependent a lot of the time on the type of review you want to give. It’s a debate for another time, because I have had my hands on the new Magic Keyboard for my 2018 iPad Pro for just a few hours and already have loads of thoughts to share — but a full review will follow later.</p>
<p>I have, for the most part, been avoiding the weirdly negative reviews and comparisons that focus on small issues blown out of proportion. As I covered in <a href="https://gr36.com/greg-thinks-things-3/">my newsletter</a>, I’ve been really excited to get this keyboard and it arrived a day later than it was supposed to. So I found myself consuming quite a few reviews to satiate my desire to use it. But that is not to say that if I had been forced to write this within the first hour or so of taking the Magic keyboard out the box my feelings would have been very different.</p>
<h2>It’s Heavy</h2>
<p>Let’s get this out the way straight away. Attaching the Magic Keyboard to your iPad Pro makes it heavier. Not just a bit heavier, there is a lot more weight and no avoiding this. This keyboard is not a Smart Keyboard by any stretch of the imagination. So if you’re looking for something similar you’re going to be very disappointed.</p>
<p>Many reviews have focused on this. While comparisons to the weight of laptops and other Windows variations are somewhat valid, they are a little logically flawed. Sure it’s about the same weight as a MacBook Pro, so is the argument that I should carry that instead? Whereas it’s down to the weight you want to carry. Without getting into the specs of the different machines and OS, there are some huge differences. I can’t take the screen off a MacBook, nor annotate a PDF by drawing on the screen, so we are not comparing Apples here. If I’m going to carry 3lb I will carry a 12.9” iPad and Magic Keyboard no question — whereas many others may not.</p>
<p>Now we have that out of the way, we can move on. There are numerous reasons for the weight of this accessory, which I wont go into here, but it ads a proper keyboard. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/the_ipad_magic_keyboard">Gruber summed it up best</a> when he described previous attempts iPad keyboards as covers you can type on. There was nothing wrong with these versions, I used them very happily for a long time. Whereas this is a proper, full sized keyboard with back light and decent key travel. With a trackpad thrown in for good measure. This is tiny when compared to any other Apple version but about the same size as everything else on the market. One thing to note is that it is <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1252541993063976962?s=20">ridiculously loud when clicking</a>.</p>
<p>The keyboard keys are’t quite as bad, but they are not far off. They give in my opinion a perfectly clicky feedback. With the right amount of movement in the keys to make typing a delight. Typing on them feels somewhere between the current Mac Magic Keyboard, with a little of the stiffness of the butterfly keyboard left in. But to be clear these are lovely scissor switches, so lets <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/557431/apple-finally-acknowledges-its-new-macbook-keyboards/">hope they last</a>.</p>
<p>I have no reason to think they wont, because everything about the unit feels premium and worth the money. Sure this <em>is</em> an expensive accessory, but in a world where the Smart Keyboard Folio is £199, for the extra £150 you get much more for your money. One of my initial trepidation’s was the rigidity of the keyboard when using it on my lap, but I am happy to report there is zero flex. Both of the hinges for positioning the iPad feel study and robust, clicking into place with reassuring tactile feedback.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="apple_ipad-pro-keyboard_now-available_04152020-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9a19a20761.jpg" alt="Apple ipad pro keyboard now available 04152020 1" width="600" height="520" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Screen Positioning</h2>
<p>The Magic Keyboard floating style is quintessentially Apple. Say what you want about a better design, but this screams designed in Cupertino. You’re going to see loads of these in coffee shops when we are allowed out again. That’s not to say the design is the right choice, thats a very personal opinion. It just looks like something Apple would do. The design also brings the iPad closer to your face which is a nice touch, saving some neck ache. The two hinges allow movement from 90 to 130 degrees.</p>
<p>This range of movement sounds like plenty depending on your usage. I am not getting into the whole drawing mode debate comparing to something that has never been advertised, but unfortunately it isn’t much movement at all. I feel as if the screen positions are almost as limiting as they were before. This isn’t going to bother <em>me</em> going forward and I completely understand why it is like this. However the furthest 130degree position is just about suitable for my needs and at this point  still feels a little top heavy when on my lap.</p>
<h2>Wants For The Future</h2>
<p>It is very early days in my usage, and despite my early disappointment I am happily typing away on it.</p>
<p>The Magic Keyboard feels very much like a first-gen product with some important lessons learnt from the covers that have gone before. There are design choices that have been made to get the best from the form factor. Ultimately boiling down to a few nitpicking details.</p>
<p>I’d love to see the power connector able to also transfer data so I don’t need any more dongles hanging out the side, but this would mean a redesign of the iPad technology rather than a better case.</p>
<p>I would also like to see the keyboard get a row of function keys or at the very least an FN key to perhaps use the numbered row. I don’t adjust the backlight to my keyboard very often, but when I do I expect it to be right in front of me along with volume control and screen brightness.</p>
<p>I will refrain from any major judgements just yet and save them for a full review, but there are surprisingly few things I would change, and none that put me off completely.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With all things said, this is the sort of keyboard I have always wanted for my iPad. The robustness of a proper keyboard was without doubt a limiting factor in previous years and one of the reasons I started using a Laptop again.</p>
<p>The iPad Pro Magic Keyboard is the best keyboard you can get for your iPad Pro but its far from perfect. This isn’t;t going to be for everyone. If you want a laptopesk experience on iOS then look no further. For anything else, move along.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I try and keep the <a href="https://gr36.com/gear">My Gear</a> page of the blog updated regularly, but I change my mind so many times and buy new things far too often. Indeed I am a bad minimalist, but I do try and make sure everything is sold before I buy something new. My current set up is a bit confused at the moment and it is stressing me out a little but at the same time I am amazingly grateful to be able to use such a range of stuff.</p>
<p>My main computer is an iMac Pro. I love working on it, it’s powerful, elegant and does everything I want it to. From my design work, to producing the occasional video and spending far too much time in the Adobe suite of apps it never misses a beat. At home I am currently using a 2017 5k iMac, which does most things but to be honest doesn’t get used much of the time. Mainly my wife is using it for her home working and my son does some school things on it.</p>
<p>I also carry around with me a 2019 MacBook Air for use in meetings and while travelling. I bought this when I rage quit using my <a href="https://gr36.com/today-is-the-day-i-quit-the-ipad/">iPad Pro 6 months ago</a>. I wont go into the reasons in here but the MacBook Air is great for note taking, meetings and other light tasks with fantastic battery life. The current situation doesn’t lend itself to me needing a laptop at the moment, so it is being used by a friend to work from home rather than sit in its box.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert, of course I bought an iPad again when the new ones came out, and I’m waiting with bated breath for the arrival of the Magic Keyboard. I wouldn’t say I went back to using an iPad solely because of the Magic keyboard but that and awesome set up <a href="https://thedent.net/my-ipad-pro-setup/">walkthroughs like Andy Nicolaides</a>, makes me want to do more with my set up. Things like the great AboveTEK Elegant Aluminium <a href="https://amzn.to/3eD9Wes">iPad Pro Stand</a> and also the addition of a proper laptop like keyboard allows my iPad to become more. As Federico Viticci points out, the iPad becomes a <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/">modular computer</a> when a supportive Eco-system exists around it.</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that I really <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1252228727418744835?s=20">enjoy writing on the iPad</a>, means that I don’t feel my MacBook Air will be around very long. However I want to do more with my set up to make this transition worth while. I don’t ever see myself working full time on an iPad but I may use it sometimes with an external monitor, which I can’t do with my current iMac. So where do I go from here?</p>
<p>My desire to make my set up <em>more</em> is also contrasted to my need to make my computer more discreet. A more minimal approach to my office would make me much more comfortable, as well as win me some Instagram points! I don’t like a great big iMac stuck on my desk, so I am leaning more towards something like the LG Ultra Fine or an ultra wide display which I could mount to a wall and also use with my Switch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the computing power and outlay of a Mac Mini isn’t pulling me in at the moment, but I guess never say never. It wouldn’t take much to out power my iMac but I’d love something that can do things more easily. Or maybe I just have massive FOMO — who knows.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The negativity is increasing by the day. If you can’t feel it growing when you talk to others, it’s pretty easy to see by the style of posts on the internet. They have slowly changed from helpful working at home tips to instructions or <a href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2020-04-17/working-from-home-regular-work-wardrobe-dress-up">ridicule of others</a> that are doing whatever they need to get by. There is absolute nothing wrong with what you are doing, there no precedent for this.</p>
<p>I’ve seen people seek more attention than normal. I’ve seen people disappear. I’ve seen people claim more appreciation they should do, and avoid all the validation they should get. I’m hopeful that most people don;t care and are doing their own thing — but you need to know you can do whatever you need to get you through.</p>
<p>Marketing emails and every advert on TV are telling us these are uncertain times. That’s because we have never faced anything like this before. In the UK we may well have faced two word wars and our country being in all sorts of weird situations. However we’ve never placed so much faith in healthcare, science and the people that work in those fields that ever before. It’s scary.</p>
<p>Listen to me when we say you can’t do exactly what you want. You can’t go against advice as show your entitlement by protesting closures. But you can do whatever you need to get you through these tough times.</p>
<p>Some will try and put you down and say you need to be productive, learn new skills, or downright dictate what you should wear. But you need to know it’s ok to show your opinions and it’s totally ok to do as you wish as long as you come out strong. If there are possible to take away I am confident that people will come out of this better, tougher and more focused than ever to do things that are good for you and the people around you.</p>
<p>Be kind to others. Be kind to yourself. Look after everyone you can. Listen to advice and take it on board. Most of all though wash you dam hands and stay home.</p>

<p>Josh Ginter <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/the-2020-ipad-pro/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 12.9-inch iPad Pro excels on a desk, but grinds to a halt everywhere else. I haven’t picked up or walked around with the big iPad Pro in about six months and haven’t read with it on the couch in even longer. I often use the big iPad Pro at the office to digitally sign PDFs, but even that feels like a rewrite of all those clipboard adventures from sixth grade science class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just can’t agree with this at all. I understand that a bigger iPad means you have to make allowances and it isn’t as portable as the 11” version. However that doesn’t mean it “grinds to a halt everywhere else”. I read on my iPad most days sat on the couch or in bed catching up on RSS feeds or reading lists.</p>
<p>I also know many others that do the same, so making this sweeping statement is a little strange. I agree with the point that most people should buy the smaller version, but when I <a href="https://gr36.com/moving-to-the-bigger-ipad/">switched the the larger one</a> I have never looked back.</p>
<p>I am currently using my 12.9” iPad for absolutely everything and cant wait to get my hands on the <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1250473014304612360?s=20">magic keyboard</a>.</p>

I eventually figured out that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/nintendo-switch-new-releases/">the new releases page on Nintendo’s eShop</a> was a site I went to somewhat regularly just to see if anything new was there. I was able to save that URL as a web feed and now I’m getting updates as soon as new games are added. It’s pretty nice!</p></blockquote>
<p>Inoreader seem to always be on the cutting edge of what they can do. and one of the services I love using. They allow you to add in email newsletters and now also track pages that don’t have an RSS feed.</p>
<p>Like Matt above I really struggled to find a page I’d want to track – I tried the apple site and it didn’t work either!</p>
<p>Also you can only do this in their own apps, which is understandable, but I use Reeder so it’s pretty much useless to me.</p>

<blockquote><p>Let’s say you get a QR Code with a link to a video from YouTube but you don’t have the official app installed on your iPhone.

<blockquote><p>Developers will need to specify which part of the app should be downloaded by iOS as an Over-The-Air package to read that content. The floating card will show options to download the full version of the app from the App Store or to open that content with the app if it’s already installed.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the article mentions this is very similar to <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/slices">Slices</a> that Google announced in 2018. Again proving that quite often Google have the right idea but seem to lack the control or the motivation to gain enough traction.</p>
<p>I am not sure how many apps adopt things from Android when announced, but the iOS eco-system seems to be ready to go as soon as the public update happens. iOS14 is shaping up to be a big update.</p>

<p>For years of my life, I have never strayed away from the mouse supplied with my computer. That usually meant horrible PC vendors attempts and more recently an Apple Magic mouse or trackpad. There isn’t much magic about these mice, and it’s only when you use one all day every day that you realise just how uncomfortable it is. Sure you can use gestures, but it’s just far too flat and unergonomic.</p>
<p>With this, my journey into finding a suitable mouse lead me down far too many YouTube rabbit holes – but I landed on the <a href="https://amzn.to/2QWvjgF">Logitech MX Master 3.</a>  As you may already be able to tell this is the third iteration of Logitechs well thought after MX Master range. This new version is an iteration on the first few but offers a few tweaks and changes that make it a worthy upgrade and the best version to date.</p>
<h2>Ergonomics</h2>
<p>I don’t think I am alone in thinking that the most important thing from a mouse is comfort. It can have as many buttons and gestures on it as you like, but if it’s shaped weird or just wrong for your working position, then you’re going to struggle. The high curves and comfortable rounded edges of this mouse make it one of the most comfortable I have had the pleasure of using – as long as you’re right-handed of course. The MX Master 3 fits perfectly into my hand, and also anyone else that has laid ether hands on it.</p>
<p>There is something weird about other people using this mouse because it feels so personal to you. The customisation options and buttons feel part of you and the way you work. It’s full click things, glowing things and more scrolling stuff than you can shake a stick at. When you think you’ve found them all, Logitech throws a few more in there hidden under the thumb rest or underneath your palm.</p>
<p>What they didn’t include was a place to store the accompanying dongle, but I’m not sure if you need this with modern laptops and tablets. Mine is still sitting in the box after using it once. However, this mouse offers a vast range of connectivity to Mac, PC and iOS.</p>
<p>If you’re stuck, it works over USB and not only that you can charge it and use it at the same time! What a revelation. Battery life is ridiculous for the charging time it needs. Plug it into a USB cable and leave it an hour and you’ll be good to go for a reported 70 hours. In fact, in the two months, I have been using it I have charged it twice and been using it upwards of 6 hours a day.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="MBLTTE-1-1-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/771fe11e9e.jpg" alt="MBLTTE 1 1 1" width="599" height="337" border="0" /></p>
<p>The great thing third party mice usually allow you to do is to have multiple devices set up at once. The MX Master 3 is no different, allowing you to switch between 3 different options at the touch of a button. Meaning you can switch to using a different computer or as I have seamlessly switch between macOS and iOS with the touch of a button. If you know the pain of having to unpair and repair that Apple requires, you’ll understand why this is a massive deal. When using the MX Master 3 with iOS and the new 13.4 update it works very well indeed. However you miss out on all of the customisations and some of the gestures — so this isn’t all good news.</p>
<p>The multi-paring options are for those that may use a different machine at home and work, or perhaps switch between a desktop and laptop, which is where maybe the black magic function of the MX Master 3 comes to light. <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/options/page/flow-multi-device-control">Logitech Flow</a> introduces another level above universal copy and paste. Only by having your devices on the same wi-fi network, you can seamlessly copy and paste files from one machine to another, even across operating systems.</p>
<h2>Logi-Options: Loads Of Them</h2>
<p>What is most surprising is that they manage to do this with minimal setup and a lot less hassle than I expected. You will need to grant Logi-options, the supporting software, some permission when installing. Still, in exchange, you get the ability to customise every single button and scroll wheel on the device to your liking. It doesn’t just stop at tracking or double click speed like some pointers. There are what seems like limitless options to customise all interaction and even change this depending on what application you are using. Especially great for those with very particular workflows or interaction needs.</p>
<p>Logitech provides a few default profiles and will offer to install these for you so you can see what other people use for each app. However, it takes very little time to build up a robust handful of shortcuts for your most-used functions. For example, I have set the forward button to act as a shortcut back to Selection (V) in Illustrator and the back button as the pen tool (P) — these are my most used tools, and I switch back and forth all the time. This may seem pointless because these are straight forward keyboard shortcuts, but I can worry about other things instead of reaching out for my keyboard.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-04-01-at-13.22.56-1-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d0d7896d6f.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 04 01 at 13 22 56 1 1" width="599" height="416" border="0" /></p>
<p>I was soon saving loads of time adopting shortcuts into my workflow and scrolling around with ease in almost every application I have. The MX Master 3 features both a horizontal and vertical scroll wheel for the ultimate ability to move around a canvas or scroll through your timeline. The most interesting of which is the vertical one, which now uses magnets to minimise noise and remove wear and tear. It still retains the easy switching between tense and free-scrolling that other versions have – the downside of which means I leave it spinning for way longer than I should. What can I say it’s my <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1247867314822938627?s=20">desk fidget spinner</a>.</p>
<p>One of the best buttons to master (excuse the pun) on this mouse is the gesture button. By using the button under your thumb, it allows you to have five different shortcuts built-in. Press to open mission control, hold and move backwards for expose, or side to side to switch between apps. If you don’t currently use gestures on your Magic Mouse or Trackpad, the <a href="https://amzn.to/2RlMkAW">MX Master 3</a> will persuade you to start using multiple desktops and master expose for good.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="MBLTTE-4-1-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/20487e647f.jpg" alt="MBLTTE 4 1 1" width="599" height="337" border="0" /></p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>All these words above boil down to one thing. This is the best mouse you can buy for productivity. It’s going to cost a little more, but it’s going to speed up your workflow no end. The <a href="https://amzn.to/2RlMkAW">MX Master 3</a> is overkill if you don’t spend a lot of time at your desk, but it’s the real deal for everyone else. One of the few things I haven’t suffered any buyer remorse over for a long time and I don’t see myself going back to uncomfortable Apple mice ever again.</p>

<blockquote><p>You’d probably be able to read about all these changes in a revived news media. The past decade has been devastating for journalism, with waves of job losses year after year. The rise of behavioural advertising isn’t the sole culprit, but it’s a big one. Newspaper ad revenue, steadily climbing until 2006, has plunged ever since. Where have advertisers taken their budgets instead? Overwhelmingly, to Facebook and Google and the advertising infrastructure they control. Take away their targeting advantage, and marketers would have to shift back to paying publications to reach their audiences, so-called “contextual advertising.” Getting rid of micro-targeting wouldn’t singlehandedly restore journalism to its glory days, but it could help—a lot.</p></blockquote>
<p>Online advertising is responsible for so many negative things you would think that banning it would be a no brainer. The big issue is it still makes s many companies a shed load of money it would be almost impossible to stop.</p>
<p>As much as online website can monetise themselves by showing adverts, it means that this is the sole metric they need. Articles exist simply to get views and attention – giving birth to more fake news and more clickbait rubbish.</p>

<p>Just before the country went into lockdown, I got a preview of 13.4 with proper mouse support. I tested this out with my <a href="https://gr36.com/the-ipad-goes-full-circle/">entry-level iPad</a> not expecting much and was blown away. I immediately went out and bought another 12.9″ iPad Pro.</p>
<p>I can’t overstate this. The newly designed interface is a delight to use and goes some of the ways to understanding why Apple took so bringing this in. The easy way would have been to have the same old arrow – but instead, we got something that fits iOS perfectly, a finger-like curser that morphed into whatever it is you’re trying to select.</p>
<blockquote><p>Move the pointer above a button and the circle morphs into the button itself, “snapping” into it, enveloping it like an amoeba, causing it to glow in a pleasing way. What this means is the usual precision of a trackpad isn’t required to get exact hits on navigational elements. – Craig Mod for <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ipad-trackpad-cursor/">Wired</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Why does this make such a difference you ask. Well – decides the software bugs and the annoying interface, one of the biggest things that stopped me using my iPad was its limitedness. Such I can use it as an iPad and somewhat as a computer when I’m travelling. It just didn’t have the flexibility to use it as a computer if needed. As I am spending more and more time at a. Desk, I can not pair a keyboard and mouse and use it was a desktop, combine it with the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MXQU2B/A/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-129%E2%80%91inch-4th-generation-british-english">magic keyboard and use as a laptop</a>, and strip it down to read on a tablet.</p>
<p>The iPad kind of sort of did this before, but nowhere near as good as it does now – Bravo Apple.</p>

<p>Being one of the lucky ones, I can continue to complete my work from home and exchange my work for money in the never-ending cycle of capitalism. I have already written about my <a href="https://gr36.com/regular-9-5/">destain for a regular 9-5 job</a>. I have kids to sort out, meeting to attend and just stuff to do in the day. We all have, and this has been highlighted more than ever during this time we are confined to homes.</p>
<p>I have been doing this on and off for a few months, but it’s still hard for me to do it regularly and consistently. At the moment I am working from 7-1ish and then again from 5-8ish, and this allows me time to share the care with my daughter. I don’t very often time sensitive things to do, so I am fortunate that flexibility suits me.</p>
<p>What I am hoping from this forced isolation period is that more companies start to open their minds to remote work. There is a wealth of things that can be achieved by adopting it, and working remotely should become what we all move towards. This isn’t going to work for everyone, but can work for some many people</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is, there are a thousand ways to do remote work, but it starts with committing to it at all levels of the company. If you assume positive intent and place trust in your coworkers and employees—knowing that if they do great work in an office, they can do great work anywhere—then you will all succeed. – <a href="http://ma.tt/">Ma.tt</a></p></blockquote>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Around this time last year, I was urging readers to think about where they are placing their technology investment seriously. It was a call to try and force people to think more in-depth than a shiny new thing. Think about where the product is coming from and what the money you are exchanging will fund. We all need to take extra time when considering funding brands like Google, Facebook and many others.</p>
<p>However, in recent weeks it has become apparent the difference in company ethics then the chips are down. The way they treat their staff and prioritise things when faced with the unprecedented times speaks volumes about the company as a whole – and it’s essential that from now on you vote strongly with your wallet.</p>
<p>In the UK, High Street and online brands have shown their true colours and prioritised profits instead of staff health. Companies such as <a href="https://gr36.com/where-to-put-your-tech-investment/">Sports Direct</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/jd-wetherspoon-refuses-pay-suppliers-until-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-ends">Wetherspoons</a> and <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/virgin-media-staff-at-danger-coronavirus-a4400996.html">Virgin Media</a> have come under massive criticism for the way they are handling government instructions and the health of their staff. Understandably, a business wants to continue as much as possible, but many have simply not listened to instruction and prioritised profits over the health of their staff. Or in the case of Wetherspoons, used Government funding as an excuse to screw over their team.</p>
<p>If you want to buy into the stories or not, that’s up to you – but at least listen to what’s going on and choose more wisely.</p>
<p>It’s understandable for companies not to be prepared for something like this, but it’s not acceptable for them to carry on as usual and cram warehouse workers in as standard. Some companies are no strangers to risking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions">workers health to profits</a>, but endangerment like <a href="https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/b/500-workers-walk-out-of-asos-factory-after-company-fails-to-enforce-social-distancing">some we have seen</a> is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Do not wait for government intervention, because it will never come. Do not threaten action online, because most of the time, it can’t live up to the promise. Just simply think about where you are buying things from and placing your investment. Would you want to be treated the way we have seen in recent weeks? If the answer is not, do not fund the company to carry on doing so. You re the only thing that matters, and where you spend your money is more important than ever.</p>

     <p>Many people are already using an iPad as their desktop ‘computer’, and with the launch of the new magic keyboard, this may rise further. The new magic keyboard for iPad Pro has a USB-C passthrough for power and as such will mean your iPad could be left on charge all the time while on your desk – is this safe to do? That’s a hard question to ask, but hopefully, I found an answer.</p>
<p>This question isn’t a new one, and it’s one that everyone has an opinion on. Much as everyone complaining in a shop has a friend that works for trading standards; everyone becomes a physicist when talking about charging your battery. Leading to much hearsay and loads of conflicting information.</p>
<p>The straight to the point answer is that battery technology has drastically improved since people started charging their mobiles every night. Back then, there were all sorts of scare stories about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/dec/05/blackberry-investigate-exploding-phone">exploding Blackberry’s</a> and only charging your phone <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/features/92897/charging-your-phone-overnight-battery-myths-debunked">from below 10%</a>. The myths are vast and frankly downright weird at times, but it’s safe to say that there is loads of technology built into the battery of your iPad to protect it.</p>
<p>Since 2012, Apple has made <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-ipad-charging-fine-keep-it-plugged-in/">charging much more complex</a> and made loads of improvements aimed at maximising your battery life. This is universal across the range of devices, so what’s suitable for one is ideal for another. Battery university (yes that’s a real thing) has a vast array of information on Lithium-based Batteries, and are often quoted as a good source for information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In theory, such a mechanism should work forever, but cycling, elevated temperature and ageing decrease the performance over time. –</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries">Battery University</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They conclude after much research and loads of graphs that the user can do a few things to prolong the longevity of their battery. Highlighting that “The worst situation is keeping a fully charged battery at elevated temperatures” – so avoiding high temperatures should be a significant indicator towards maximising life.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cd16cccb76.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 11" /></figure>
<p>The number of cycles that you iPad will go though does add to the wear on your battery, but there is no clear answer to what a cycle is. A more important factor is elevated temperatures. So in theory, keep your battery charged and away from heat and you should be ok. Apple says <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/">between 0 and 35 degrees C</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evaluating battery life on counting cycles is not conclusive because a discharge may vary in-depth and there are no clearly defined standards of what constitutes a cycle –</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries">Battery University</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second piece of information you hear is the level of battery charge you should be completing. A considerable wealth of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/85fqkz/is_it_a_good_idea_to_keep_my_ipad_pro_plugged_in/">forum posts</a> and opinions display numbers that seem plucked from thin air. However, research does suggest that a battery should not be charged to 100%. Ever. The good news is that your battery never reaches that far, 100% in the software is not 100% battery capacity – so there is no need to worry.</p>
<p>Since iOS13 Apple has been working on machine learning your habits and maximising battery life. Once the OS displays your iPad is at 100%, it will <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210512">intelligently</a> discharge and recharge the battery very gradually. Apple has also intelligently accounted for issues that seem to arise after 80% capacity. Once your iPad is charged to above 80%, the charging rate is dramatically reduced. So think of the last 20% as what’s generally referred to as a trickle charge.</p>

<p>I can’t overstate this. The new designed interface is a delight to use, and goes some of the way to understanding why they took so long. The easy way would have been to just have the same old arrow – but instead we got something that fits iOS perfectly.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Despite launching a new iPad only a few days ago, according to <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20200320VL201.html">DigiTimes</a>, the company still plans to go ahead with another new iPad version by the end of the year. This new version will one of a range of devices to feature a Mini LED display. “Apple reportedly prefers mini LED to OLED for its medium-size devices and will launch an iPad Pro with backlighting in the fourth quarter of 2020” they proclaim.</p>
<p>Rockstar Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/03/apple-14-1-inch-macbook-pro-mini-led/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> supports a similar idea that Apple will indeed launch an even higher-end iPad Pro with a mini-LED display in 2020 – an iPad Pro Pro if you will. So why precisely and where exactly would this fit into the lineup? That’s a difficult question to answer, but <em>could </em>this point to a larger-screened iPad.</p>
<p>I huge iPad isn’t a new idea, it’s one that has been swirling for years. Yet seems to have gathered pace again since the launch of the 3rd generation models. A modern design that makes infinitely more sense when placed on a desk due to the slimmer bezels and use of Face ID. Opinion posts started popping up again recently from <a href="https://www.imore.com/why-its-time-bigger-ipads">iMore</a> and <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/is-it-time-for-an-even-bigger-ipad-pro-19613750/">Slashgear</a>, to name a few, dreaming of a future with a larger desk iPad.</p>
<blockquote><p>On a product like the iPad, where the display is the device to a degree beyond a MacBook or iMac, offering even bigger screens is even more essential. Artists would have bigger canvases. Your apps would have more room in side-by-side and slide-over modes, or you could fit more on your screen when editing photos and videos. – Joseph Keller</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imore.com/why-its-time-bigger-ipads">for iMore</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed the new mouse and trackpad support in iOS 13.4 pushed the iPad even more towards desk usage while remaining amazingly portable.</p>
<p>Consistent improvements to the OS is leading even more people towards using an iPad as their only ‘computer’. The unavoidable trade-off of larger is reducing portability. Boost the screen size to 16″ and match the size of the MacBook Pro means the iPad is much easier to use on a desk, but terrible to carry around. The iPad is a tablet and touch first and foremost, so why should Apple even bother.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now that the trackpad and mouse support is happening, and considering that Apple has announced this before their usual info dump in June, one can’t help wonder if macOS or pro apps may be appearing on the iPad Pro soon. – Daryl Baxter for</p>
<p><a href="https://stealthoptional.com/tech/the-new-ipad-pro-and-ipados-14-could-massively-evolve-the-ipad/">Stealth Optional</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Cupertino could mediate this somewhat with better external monitor support. The current version means that the external screen is letterboxed and conforms to an iPad aspect ratio of 4:3. Whereas most motors you buy hover around the 16:9 ratio, leading to lots of wasted space. (The 11″ iPad is 1.33:1)</p>
<p>If Apple is indeed expecting Pros to seriously consider these devices, and let’s be <a href="https://stealthoptional.com/tech/the-new-ipad-pro-and-ipados-14-could-massively-evolve-the-ipad/">honest they should</a>, then a bigger larger screen is a must. Adobe launched Photoshop on the iPad last year and plan to release Illustrator later this year. So what exactly is stopping people? Unfortunately working paradigms and workflows that have been built up over years, then take years to break. So adopting non-standard computing can be too much for some.</p>
<p>However, an iPad Pro at any size that provides more computing power than most Laptops and you can draw on the screen is the perfect computer for ‘pros’. The iPad is already providing thousands of people the ability to carry around a touch-first tablet for <a href="https://gr36.com/the-ipad-goes-full-circle/">tradition consumption</a> but also power the majority of their work. It’s now time Apple help to turn those thousands into millions and offer the reasons for a switch.</p>
<p>I bigger iPad will help attract more users for drawing, video editing and loads of creative fields. This rumoured iPad Pro Pro could point to exactly that move. However, there are a few more bits Apple need to take the lead on to push this over the line, and fully release the iPad’s potential</p>

<p>I almost got to this point about a month ago. I even took my watch box (box full of regular watches) down to the jewellers and got the batteries replaced.</p>
<p>What stopped me in the end is being able to leave my phone at home more often and still be contactable. So instead of dropping the watch and using my phone more, I stopped using my phone nearly as much.</p>
<p>I can completely see where Chris is coming from though – Apples most personal device isn’t actually THAT useful when you don’t workout much and especially when you work from home.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I have now been working from home on and off for a little over a year. I am no whiz at this and haven’t done much remote work at all. However, I have read no end of guides because I suffered severely with procrastination and also had a considerable tendency to work too much. This sounds great at first because I am getting things done, but quickly turned into the fact that I was always working.</p>
<h2>Separate things</h2>
<p>Sounds easy, but can be super tricky depending on your home. You don’t need to have a large house, but you need to set aside some space for working. If you’ve got a spare bedroom or desk in a room not used regularly, you’re all set. However, you could also set aside virtual space if regular space is at a premium.</p>
<p>For example, you can work at your kitchen table, but when you’re not working, make sure all your stuff is away—laptop or computer out of sight and any desk things out the way. You begin to separate work and home time because your things are away, so it’s no longer work time.</p>
<h2>Plan Your Time Better</h2>
<p>When you’re in a working environment or an office is pretty easy to work on things because everyone around you should be working also. However, at home, two things can happen.</p>
<p>You don’t work enough – you get distracted but all the things in your home and neglect the work you should be doing.</p>
<p>You work too much – your home becomes your office, so you think you should always be working.</p>
<p>Both of these things are bad for your business and your mind. Block out periods in the day and take regular breaks. Working from home makes it easy  to do other things like workout or play computer games. You don’t have to work 9–5 – but make sure you still do the hours you’re expected to do.</p>
<p>I do this in a separate iCloud calendar and work to a strict <a href="https://gr36.com/todoist-my-new-app-to-get-things-done/">Todoist</a> plan of attack achieving certain things at certain times. I quite often plan this on a Sunday evening for the following work. Doesn’t mean it’s rigid, but its a frame to start with.</p>
<h2>Be Comfortable</h2>
<p>Don’t work at your kitchen table if it’s going to hurt your back. Not everyone has a desk and office chair to sit in, but do the best you can. Pillows and cushions are a useful tool for making you sit better, including supporting your lower back or raising your feet.</p>
<p>Become conscious of the way you are sitting and the type of work you are doing, and make changes if required. You can do yourself long term injury of you don’t pay attention.</p>
<p>Working from home should give you much more flexibility, depending on your companies outlook, but can cause some stress if you don’t plan well. Hopefully more people can start ditching <a href="https://gr36.com/regular-9-5/">the normal 9–5 grind</a>.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>First off the bat. I understand that I am in a ridiculously unique position that my employer trusts me and gives the freedom I need. So I am already coming from a privileged position compared to most people. With all that’s said –  I just can’t fit into a regular 9-5 job, and I don’t think most people should have to either.</p>
<p>You see, we all have the stuff to do. Things that don’t fit into the time after five and going to bed, or weekends. I have social workers to talk to, kids schools to meet with, medical things to sort out, and so does everyone else. I don’t mind working until late into the night to get things done if it means some freedom in the middle of the day to work out or run an errand.</p>
<p>In this climate, many people are introduced to working from home, and all the issues that go with it. But I’m hoping that this highlights the number of people that can and should be working more flexibly. Hopefully, more companies realise just how many positions can be filled by people that at least in part are allowed the flexibility to work from home.</p>
<p>I appreciate there are a considerable amount of jobs that just can’t be done any other way – but this draconian office working time is built on ideas that are old and showing their age. Business’ must trust their staff to accomplish the tasks assigned to them in a manner that suits both the requirements of the company and also the individual. If they do not trust the staff members enough to do this, then hard questions need to be asked about the staff they are employing in the first place or indeed the mentality of the management.</p>
<p>It’s nice to think that everyone should, and are, working at every point in the day but they’re enough checks and balances possible to ensure work gets done outside of office hours and freedom given to those that need it.</p>

     <p>One of the most prominent tones running through the indie web is being able to own your content. To publish it online and be able to do whatever you want with it. Some people publish to WordPress, some to Medium, others may build their own static sites, but the real problem with most of these approaches is being able to move your content to somewhere else easily.</p><p>I first ran into this pain when closing down my very first WordPress website. I’d been working hard on building a Jekyll based static site because hosting was becoming expensive, and it was the best place to put everything. When it comes to all blog posts and images, it proved a nightmare. Sure there are ways to do it, <a href="https://blog.webjeda.com/wordpress-to-jekyll-migration/">kind of</a>. However, none of the options work very well, or even at all. So you’re left to slog through all of your posts and copy them over.</p><p>Pretty easy to do if you’re only a few in, but a mammoth task if you’re as post happy as I am or been witting for several years. Several times during the process, I considered giving up, and a lesser person may have done so, begging the question of if this is intentional? If you own your content, then it should be easy to move from place to place, and platforms really should think about this as a selling point to their hosting.</p><p>Jeff Perry, the master of moving his blog to different providers, feels this <a href="https://jeffperry.blog/2020/03/2/%F0%9F%94%97-the-great-blog-cleanup">more than anyone</a>. He found WordPress to be a massive pain, and only Blot creator David Murfiled goes out of his way to help.</p><blockquote><em>I will say moving to Blot was easy because the creator, Dave, is probably the most helpful and responsive person I’ve ever worked with. When I was using  </em><br /><br /><em><a href="https://t.co/OfH9MKIBh8?amp=1">[micro.blog](http://micro.blog)</a></em><br /><br /><em> I felt that the back end was needlessly complicated, and for WordPress, my worst experience was with WordPress themselves because they charge up the ass for little support – Jeff Perry</em></blockquote><p>Manton Reece creator of micro.blog <a href="https://www.manton.org/2017/11/24/blog-archive-format.html">talked about this quite a while ago</a>, and proposed that providers implement a standard. Whenever I hear these calls for a standard to be implemented, I am always reminded of the <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">XDCD comic</a>.<br /></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/cc8fb1a291.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Standards 1" loading="lazy" title="standards-1.png" /></figure><p>But clearly, something needs to be done. Each platform offers the ability to import and export options, but very few of these work together, or much fo the time even work very well. Indeed micro.blog is the only platform I have seen that goes so far as to make your import go as smoothly as possible. Creating bespoke options for Instagram, Medium, WordPress, Jekyll and many others. I can’t speak for getting your content out again, but the transparency of this service should help at least a little.</p><p>During a recent round trip to Ghost Pro, and back again, I imported and exported all of my posts 3 or 4 times. Even though I was doing this on the same platform, this still didn’t work fully. Leaving me to trawl through all of my posts and add in missing images and move data to the correct place. So even the self-proclaimed <a href="https://ghost.org/">home of independent publishing</a> suffers from the same old issues as everyone else. Platforms want your data, but don’t want you to take it again without some pain.</p>

<p>It isn’t very often something truly new comes to market. All right we’ve seen folding phones before, but not one this particular way, and not one available to the  mass market. The Galaxy Fold was horrendously expensive and had some longevity concerns, and as yet you can’t buy the Moto Razr <a href="https://shop.ee.co.uk/mobile-phones/pay-monthly/motorola-razr-black/details?WT.MC_ID=ON_MEC_S_700000000044366_Brand+_+PAYM+_+Motorola+_+RAZR+_+Hybrid+_+EXACT_p50199620492&amp;WT.srch=1&amp;s_kwcid=AL!932!3!404227664639!e!!g!!ee%20motorola%20razr&amp;mchannel=ppc&amp;ds_rl=1238748&amp;logo=TUR1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAs67yBRC7ARIsAF49CdWzBMN56EYSPHpTgdeM5p9ycaXBDLMqCRk7vkHF7f3huKKrbntWwq0aAgbIEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">other than on an expensive 24 month</a> contract on EE. So when the chance came for me to not only get <a href="https://gr36.com/galaxy-fold-handson/">hands on with one</a> but use one – I got <a href="https://gr36.com/advance-tech-exciting/">a tad over excited</a>.</p>
<p>Ok, the Galaxy Z Flip has some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/16/21139897/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-ultra-thin-glass-durability-scratch-test-jerryrigeverything">longevity concerns of its own</a>, but I don’t think that is enough to dismiss such a new device.  It’s easy to be dismissive of something that doesn’t fit into your vision of what a device should be. Yet all others around me got excited when I first took the phone out of the box and that speaks volumes. All the insides of the Z Flip box are standard Samsung, yet when you take the phone out and peel off the plastic, something entirely different happens.</p>
<p>The device feels sturdy and reassuring, well built and engineered, but not bulky or uncomfortable. Not only much more comfortable and lighter than an iPhone 11, but considerably taller and slimmer. I am reminded of the memes that were made around the time of the iPhone 5 launch, and when you use a device like the Galaxy Z Flip and indeed the Note10 line, it shows how right Apple were back then. A slimmer taller screen is better in almost every way.</p>
<h2>Real Talk After The Fold</h2>
<p>The folding screen of the Z Flip is both marvelled and ridiculed at each point by technology commentators, but you can’t argue its usefulness. You may scoff and think that the Galaxy Fold is a much more useful device, but that the Z flip does allow me to have a 6.7″ screen device, but not feel one in my pocket. When not in use the device slims down to about the same size as a coaster, all be it a heavier one that feels a little weird in your pocket.</p>
<p>When in use the screen is comically tall, there is no getting around it. One handed use can be a little clumsy if the app you’re using is top-heavy, but a tall screen gives you a great way to consume written content, be it social media, emails or blog posts. I love reading on this device because it’s much more suited to 90% of web usage and fits nicely in your palm. The screen itself is bright and vivid, some will scoff at it ‘only’ being 1080p but it does it’s job well with no issues.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Galxy-Z-Flip-In-Hand-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1ddd0502ae.jpg" alt="Galxy Z Flip In Hand 1" width="2000" height="1125" border="0" />The only issue with scrolling vertically on this screen in particular is the crease in the middle. It is unavoidable, you <em>can</em> see it, and anyone that says otherwise is mistaken. It sticks out like a sore thumb, mainly when using a dark UI (which I much prefer) or when the screen is empty of content. Even if you get used to seeing the crease after a few days of use like the notch on the iPhone; you feel it every time you swipe around and if you want a folding phone you have to find a way to make peace with this fact.</p>
<h2>Minimalist Phone?</h2>
<p>That shouldn’t put you off though, the crease is unapologetic. It is there the first time you pick the device up and won’t go away. But it also shouldn’t get any worse, because it is purposely <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1228736762186551297?s=20">put there by Samsung</a> in the factory, so it doesn’t develop over time. It doesn’t go as far as ruining your experience of the phone; it is just something that is a trade-off for having a folding phone at this point in time. If having a crease in the screen bothers you, steer clear, but it’s a worthwhile trade-off for being able to fold your phone in half and put it away.</p>
<p>While we are here, it seems logical to talk about folding the phone in half, because you won’t be able to stop – perhaps ever. The hinge gives tactical feedback but also provides a smooth transition. Samsung says its a semi-rigid hinge, allowing for it to be used in that weird half folded way that Samsung thinks will appeal to ‘influencers’. So gone is the click into place that Galaxy Fold had when opening, to be replaced by a more pleasant experience. Unfortunately, you won’t be doing the communicator flip open like the devices of old – well you can, but it doesn’t <a href="https://twitter.com/theMrMobile/status/1228410045823582215?s=20">work very well</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a finality of closing the Z Flip that you don’t get with other devices. Something akin to putting the lid down on your laptop. It draws a line under your phone usage and puts it away. It will help those looking to minimalise their phone usage because the screen is now away and out of tempting site. It’s not as if you can do anything on the ridiculous front screen anyway.</p>
<p>If Samsung are going for a way to minimalist your phone, they hit the nail on the head, because the front display is ridiculous. Perhaps not in a wrong way, but I wish they have thought about using it a little more. Not going as far as they did with the Galaxy Fold, but an active display similar to the Razr would have been perfect. You are not going to do anything with this screen except glimpse notifications when they come in and check the time.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="DSC0029-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a89a5a5cc5.jpg" alt="DSC0029 1" width="599" height="337" border="0" />I don’t want to comment on battery life much further than to say that I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t last you a day of usage. During my two days taking photos and playing with the phone, it still has more than 25% battery left after taking it off charge at 7 am. After a bit more usage, I will share full battery life expectations.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>On the initial set up and test, I was disappointed with the performance of the camera, but there was a software update waiting for that improved things dramatically. I have a feeling this update is not installed on demo devices and some hands on versions I have seen, so perhaps take some video revews with a small pinch of salt.</p>
<p>I have to prefaces all my words with the fact I am not a fan of the processing done by Samsungs cameras. They often look overly processed sometimes downright ridiculous colour saturation in them. I prefer something much more natural-looking, and I am undeniably used to iPhone images.</p>
<p>As well as the usual family snaps, I took the Galaxy Z Flip with me on a day out to <a href="https://www.thedeep.co.uk/">The Deep Aquarium</a>, mainly because it is often one of the most challenging environments to get good snaps in. Dark rooms, with brightly lit tanks full of colourful fish that don’t stay still. I must say I am very impressed with its performance, not everything came out perfectly, but there were very few pictures I had to delete. At times I have often struggled to make Samsung cameras work for me, even as recently as the Note 10+ – having to turn features off and dial back processing – but this is not one of these times. Find a gallery below.</p>

<p>Galaxy Z Flip Around The Home</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am at a certain point in my life where each iPhone is as boring as the last one. I am excited by what other brands are doing and am always tempted to use something else but never do. I never want to say I will or won’t do anything else but switch back to an iPhone but using the Z Flip has opened my eyes to a brand new world. I enjoy the feel of having a much smaller device in my pocket and folding it out when needed – and to be honest, I also said this about the Galaxy Fold.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Z Flip is another step up in use case, a device that offers an improvement where the Galaxy Fold felt like you had to use gloves on it, but also an eye-opening form factor switch. The taller, slimmer screen is much easier to use and displays much of what I do online all day much better than anything else.</p>
<p>Pulling out the Z Flip leaves people around you genuinely amazed, and I have had loads of questions about it. Sure we are all aware these phones exist, but the general public doesn’t seem to be. Unfortunately, when showing it off, the black version I have is a fingerprint magnet, the same as the black Note10+ I had, so I spend far too much time is spent wiping off the body. The finish is also a bit too slippery than I would like, couple this with the smaller frame to carry and I feel a little uneasy using it outside.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="DSC0036-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8a8a85b8cf.jpg" alt="DSC0036 1" width="599" height="337" border="0" />With all these words out the way – I am at a point as I write this that I am stuck at a Schrödinger’s phone. I both think the device is a game-changing smartphone and also a bit of a gimmick. Depending on the time of day, I am both marvelled and miffed at the Galaxy Z Flip. It offers me a use case like nothing before but is it worth a whopping £1300 price tag?</p>
<p>By far Galaxy Z Flip is the best folding phone you can buy. It is also a terrific smartphone that offers a brand new use case never before seen. I am just not 100% convinced that use case warrants the price tag or if it exists at all. I love using the Galaxy Z Flip because it is something completely new, but will that wear thin over time? Is this a solution to something that doesn’t need solving? These are all questions in my head and unique to each person.</p>
<p>What I woudl say is the dismissive feeling I have seen towards this phone are cimoletely unwarranted. This device feels like the start of something special and there is no denying it. I will try and answer the rest of the questions I have over the coming days – stay tuned.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The folding things are coming. You can’t get away from it. When I say things, I mean all sorts of things are going to be foldable, and it doesn’t matter your definition. It could be a tablet that folds into a phone-sized device or a phone that folds into something smaller. That fact that this year proves to be genuinely exciting for foldable devices should be enough.</p>
<p>The scepticism is somewhat understandable given the false starts with both the Galaxy Fold and Huawei Mate X, but now phones such as the Moto Razr and Galaxy Z Flip are hitting the mass market this should be fading. However, there seems to be lots of negativity still.</p>
<p>The detractors against such a device are vocal when any mention of both the Razr and Z Flip are spoken about on social media. With a consensus that a folding phone is pointless. To a certain degree that may be the case for your use case, but the fact that these devices are now available – with the latter sporting a glass screen – should be enough to get excited about.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/96f4685a1b.jpg" alt="960x0 1" title="960x0-1.jpg" border="0" width="599" height="395" />The fact that Samsung has made such a huge step forward just months <a href="https://gr36.com/galaxy-fold-handson/">after the Galaxy Fold</a> was released is bordering on insane. If this kind of pace of innovation can be maintained, then devices that will appeal to you as a consumer are right around the corner. Not every device is made of every type of user, but the fact remains that these devices are made for some users and selling very well.</p>
<p>Opinions regarding the device not appealing to your use case are one thing, but detracting from such a significant improvement in technology is another. It is an exciting prospect to have such a device hit the shelves, and I, for one, would love to get hands-on with one soon.</p>

<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="zero-fasting-review.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a6ba75fa04.jpg" alt="Zero fasting review" width="600" height="300" border="0" /><br />A few days ago, I shared <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2020/02/13/intermittent-fasting-and.html">what intermittent fasting had done for me</a> and the health benefits I have felt. This app has helped me get going on my journey and is now an essential tool for tracking my body – it’s time to look at <a href="https://www.zerofasting.com/">Zero fasting tracker</a>. Available <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1168348542">on iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zerofasting.zero">Android</a>, I am using the iOS version installed on my iPhone 11 Pro and Series 5 Apple Watch.</p>
<p>This app will only appeal to you if you are intermittently fasting, and even if you are, most people still won’t rely on one. I only started looking for something when I needed a kick to keep me going and also to keep track of my habits better. With that, the Zero app is full of fasting information on why to do it, how to do it and the answers to loads of questions you might have.</p>
<p>I found when first starting out it was both a hindrance and help to have something counting down the hours until I could eat again. So you might look at other options first – but what the app does well is make everything easy to find and straight forward to understand. Splitting areas into four tabs across the bottom to see your timer, check out the fasting options,  delve into your fasting history or learn more about fasting in general.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Zero-fasting-screenshots-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c9c410001e.jpg" alt="Zero fasting screenshots 1" width="1000" height="478" border="0" />Zero enables you to start and stop your fasting quickly and gives you default options for regular ratios and also custom options. You can also get handy notifications (if you choose to switch them on) when you are in the final hour of fasting and indeed when you can start eating again. All customisable using the fasts tab at the bottom.If you’re feeling hardcore, you can track a full fast for up to 168 hours!</p>
<p>Users will spend the majority of the time starting and stopping the timer from the timer tab. Featuring a beautiful big clock, counting down the hours until your feeding window, or counting up the hours you have been feeding for. The big green (or red) button starts and stops your fast dependant what state you are in. If you forget you can edit start and stop times, and leave feedback on your fast at the end of each cycle.</p>
<h2>Apple Watch App</h2>
<p>You can also start and stop fasting with the companion Apple Watch App. There isn’t much more you can do on the watch, but it does come with complications in a range of sizes to slot into your choice of Watch face. I found this too overbearing and reminded me too often, which proved annoying after a while, but having a tap on your wrist when there is only an hour more to go can be helpful.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Zero-fasting-Applewatch-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9a1d948cdd.jpg" alt="Zero fasting Applewatch 1" width="1000" height="399" border="0" />It would be great to be able to edit fast start points and change the ratios on the Apple Watch in future updates. If I make a mistake or want to check my history, I have to pull my phone out, whereas a swipe across to different areas would be useful. You are able to change the number of hours you want to fast for before starting and this updates the iOS app information.</p>
<p>As well as a glorified alarm system, the app will track every fast you do and display it in one of the easiest to understand designs I have used. All the information is straight forward and easy to navigate. You will find information on your fasts, comparisons in time, and if you hit your intended target. Along with this, the app pulls heart rate data from an Apple Watch, allowing you to see trends easily. Since starting, I can see a pronounced decrease in resting heart rate, and this provides more positive feedback that everything is going well.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Zero-fasting-history-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/23374de776.jpg" alt="Zero fasting history 1" width="1125" height="955" border="0" />Of course, there is a certain amount of gamification attempted by the app, encouraging you to put together ’streaks; and awarding badges. You can buy into this if you wish, but there is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6096297/">some research</a> to say this <em>does</em> help motivation for health-related areas, so it’s understandable these kind of features are here.</p>
<p>Last but not least, you can find answers to all of your questions in the Zero Learn tab. It’s filled full of interesting information and blog-type posts that help get (and keep) you going. If you can’t find the answer here, it’s not worth knowing. Of course, only people that want to start or are already fasting will even download the app never mind about go digging in here, so my definition of interesting might be subjective.</p>
<p>If you want to get started intermittent fasting, or you need something to track your cycles going forward – look <a href="https://www.zerofasting.com/">no further than Zero</a>. I can’t find a bad word to say about it, and it’s become invaluable to me.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Health is by far the most important thing for me to think about. I have been to the bottom and know what happens if I don’t take care of myself, and everything suffers. Around three years ago, I discovered intermittent fasting and its time for me to share what it has done for my life.</p>
<p>The reason I am writing this is that fasting seems to be the new self-help buzz word. All the meditation and mindful new buzz are being replaced by guides on how to fast, and blogs about why you should fast. With it comes massive skepticism, people are naturally fearful of anything being pushed and marketed. However, along with mindfulness, fasting is much more than marketing, possessing numerous benefits.</p>
<p>I have been following a pretty strict 16:8 intermittent fast for more than a year. For the year before that, I was a hardcore 18:8 faster, and nothing broke my stride. All these numbers mean very little if you don’t know what I am referring too. The first number is the number of hours between my last meal and my next one as a minimum, and the second one is the number of hours I can eat for. So if I finish my evening mean at 7 pm, no calories go into my body before 11 am the next day at the earliest.</p>
<p>When I say pretty strict, I mean it, I eat breakfast sometimes at weekends if we are doing something or if my body needs it. But during the week I am dead on 16:8, and slowly increasing this to 17:7. I am currently using an iOS app called Zero to track this and record all of my other vitals to see any patterns – I will write about this in more detail later.</p>
<p>By not eating for periods of the day, my body feels much more in rhythm than ever before. With this comes a mental clarity I have not felt before, I am more engaged with tasks and don’t feel the ‘fog’ some people describe feeling after a large meal. Gone is any notion of struggling through afternoons of work, I no longer get bloated from meals, and I have much more energy at all points in the day.</p>
<p>Depending on your relationship to food, all the above will seem really easy or impossibly hard. Many people smoothly go many hours without eating but do so sporadically, and I think the pattern of fasting is essential. Reflected in my metabolism and my digestive processes being reliant on eating at specific points. Such is my routine it has allowed me to cut out any thought of breakfast easily, and restrict my calorie intake to one more suited to a healthy lifestyle. Intermittent fasting has made such a real difference to both my mental and physical health that I want people to know that all the buzz words and hype point to an improvement you could make to your life.</p>
<p>There will always be a company to try and sell things to you, but not all hype is worth ignoring.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>When I walked into a cold doctors office at Nottingham City hospital early in October 2017, I wasn’t thinking very straight at all. At the second time of asking we had been given a place in a project that would sequence mine, my wife and my daughters entire DNA to find errors. Lucie was already seven, and after a couple of false starts, we were still pushing to find a reason for her disability. The <a class="u-reply-to" href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/about-genomics-england/the-100000-genomes-project/">100,000 genome project</a> promised to find the expected error in one of Lucie genes and report back in 1-2 years.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until reading the March edition of Wired that my eyes came across the words 100,000 genomes project and “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-019-0570-7?proof=true19">broad consent</a>” that my preverbal ears pricked up. Almost three years later, and mere days after <a href="/2020/01/31/the-diagnosis-relief.html">receiving the results</a>, was the first time I had even thought about where and who I had given my data to. But it’s not data, it’s me, who exactly now held a copy of the building blocks of me? The fact that the very essence as a person is recorded by someone else is chilling, but do I have any idea who that someone is and where it will go?</p>
<p>I signed a whole heap of consent forms before giving blood. They have an excellent website that tells me a load of information about the different levels of consent. Not once have I considered this until now, I mean how on earth can you be expected to understand what you agree to when dangled the carrot of diagnosis.</p>
<p>I am in no way saying that I was pushed into giving my consent, but I wasn’t in a position to understand what giving consent meant in this situation. Never mind about considering its ramifications as to who had access to my genetic data. I wanted answers to my daughter’s problems. All the consent boxes were explained to me as well as they could be by a nurse, but the reality is if they had said it came at the cost of 10 spam emails a day and two house visits every other Sunday I would have still signed on the dotted line.</p>
<p>Much like a person applying for a loan that felt compelled to take out PPI insurance – I wanted access to the possible results, more than I worried about what me signing in a whole booklet of content forms meant.</p>
<p>Of course, because this is a very modern problem, only in recent years have we even raised the question of our data being used, never mind our health information. Tech firms have spoilt even the word personal data, tarnished the price of giving consent, and levelled un-needed stress on the terms “approved third parties”.</p>
<h2>The Building Blocks Of Me</h2>
<p>The NHS has now sequenced my entire DNA and is keeping this on file, along with almost everything else I can imagine. They can make a pretty good guess at what will become of me when I’m old, what drugs will work best on me and a bucket load of other things I don’t understand. In 1990 this would have been the best situation imaginable. An agency tasked with looking after me knows everything about me and can treat me better; it is a perfect dream.</p>
<p>In 2020, we live in a world of corporations being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/08/nhs-gives-amazon-free-use-of-health-data-under-alexa-advice-deal">given access to health data by the NHS</a>. Others gaining it through promises of how much of your DNA comes from obscure places and then <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2229828-23andme-has-sold-the-rights-to-develop-a-drug-based-on-its-users-dna/">using it for their gain</a>, and a whole range of issues going on surrounding almost everything we are as a person. Health data doesn’t feel like personal data; it doesn’t feel like it matters in the same way that a tech firm can see all my pictures of cats, or know how many times I dismiss my wife’s phones calls. It feels very unimportant and at the same time, the most crucial thing in the world.</p>
<p>I am not overly distressed if Apple knows that I went for four ruins this week, and what my average heart rate is. However, I am uncomfortable with Amazon knowing that one drug works best on me than another version and that I am likely to get prostate cancer before I’m 70. Even when data is anonymised, it doesn’t take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_re-identification">many data points to make it relevant again</a>.</p>
<p>What I need to make clear is that at no point does this project sell or give my data to Amazon, I am talking in broad strokes here. The fact remains that given the same situation again, I would not change anything. We gained a <a href="/2020/01/31/the-diagnosis-relief.html">massive benefit from taking part</a>. One that I would put up with years of spam emails and telephone calls in exchange. The real outcry is that I shouldn’t even have to think about this.</p>
<p>Technology firms have stollen our data, or at the very least been less than transparent in its harvesting. They have ruined my trust in giving consent to anyone. Even dealing with an organisation such as the NHS, that aims to offer a vast range of benefits, I am still looking for the catch. For the revenue stream that makes me their product.</p>
<p>Firms will continue to ruin experiences for those that are asking for legal consent such as the 100,000 genomes project because of the connotations now surrounding data collection. They may even stop organisations in their tracks because of the hurdles involved – yet they still carry on regardless. They are tamely regulated, unapologetic brazen and impossibly huge to comprehend. Our data will never be our data in the future, and the biggest loser is already us.</p>

     <p>This feels like the end of a nine-year journey, but also the start of a new one. Its started on the 23rd June 2010, when I welcomed my daughter into this world and ended on Tuesday when we finally got a diagnosis for her issues.</p>
<p>We already had two false starts quite early on. Having a semi-diagnosis to them be ruled out by MRI. Initial genetic testing resulted in no answers, but almost three years ago, we were offered the chance to take part in the <a href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/about-genomics-england/the-100000-genomes-project/">100,000 genomes project</a> – and this has found a diagnosis.</p>
<p>Lucie has a ridiculously rare genetic condition called (ready for this one) <a href="https://www.rarechromo.org/media/information/Chromosome%20%205/MEF2c">mef2c haploinsufficiency syndrome</a>.  A condition that only affects around 100 people in the world, but its effects run deep and affect everything she does. As much as this changes anything about the care and difficulties we face – it is hard for me to sum up my feelings.</p>
<h2>Parental Vindication</h2>
<p>This is the only word I can think of to describe my feelings at this moment in time. As much as I knew that all of Lucie issues were because of her disability, and all of the stress that comes with it was no-ones fault. I still felt responsible and knew that some people thought that at least some of the things we experienced were because of our parenting.</p>
<p>Yet as the doctor read off the issues associated with the condition, it was if he were describing Lucie thoroughly. The image on the front of the information leaflet could be Lucie in a few years. Now all I can feel is relief and vindication for Lucie’s issues.</p>
<p>The weight of feeling responsible has been lifted after nine years, and I have no words to describe the feeling. It is one that I will deal with over the coming weeks and months, but I am already starting to feel the effects.</p>
<p>A diagnosis makes no difference in the way I treat Lucie, it makes no difference to Lucie herself, but it lifts the weight that was becoming too large to bear. I am so thankful that the NHS gave us this opportunity to go so in-depth with genetic sequencing and make such a difference to our lives.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Stuart Heritage <a href="https://apple.news/AZbs37eluSVqIMiPzi2mMKA">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A psychologist at Pennsylvania State University asked 960 participants whether certain activities registered as masculine or feminine. Basic environmental housekeeping, such as recycling and taking reusable bags to the shops, were seen as feminine. As a result, some men avoided these activities out of fear that they made them look effeminate. In short, a whale just suffocated on a 10p carrier bag because you were worried that a checkout assistant might see you putting your veg in a cotton tote and try to flog you some discount mascara. Great job, masculinity.</p></blockquote>
<p>What. What did I just read.</p>
<p>Some men avoid doing the recycling or taking a reusable bag to the supermarket because they don’t want to look ‘girly’. What level of idiot do you have to be for this to be true about you. That’s not being masculine, that’s being a complete moron.</p>
<p>These thought patterns show a distinct lack of confidence in both yourself and doubt in your masculinity. I don’t usually go with all this toxic masculinity thing, but this is another level of weirdness.</p>

     <p>To motivate myself to write more, I’ve been reading more. Not just online posts but magazines and books. Looking to subscriptions service and news aggregators, despite <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/apple-news-forcing/">my initial hate</a> – Apple News won me over.</p>
<p>It turns out I didn’t need to use it more; I didn’t need to ‘train the algorithm’, I just needed to turn off the news part! You see, I hate viewing or reading the news – it is that simple. It is full of twisted and corrupted stores that are either designed or portrayed in such a way to manipulate your emotions.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" title="Apple-news-settings-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4b3bfa49a1.jpg" alt="Apple news settings 1" /></figure>
<p>There is a way to do this, but it’s hidden away in the settings titled “Restrict Stories in Today”. Not a great label for a toggle that should be much easier to find, but I would presume Apple doesn’t want you to turn it on. Go to Settings &gt; News and toggle this to on.</p>
<p>Now all you will see are channels you have subscribed to in the Today tab. No more depressing politics, no more news you don’t want to see, just what you want.</p>
<p>There are downsides to this, the discovery of new channels can be more difficult, and you might not be kept as upto date with current affairs as you once were. Be a little more mindful of not creating an echo chamber, and you should get on much better. I am now much more open to subscribing to Apple News+, and many of the channels I am now following are News+ channels. So there is a benefit to Apple in the long run – subscription all the things!</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It isn’t very often I tap away on my keyboard in rage, but today is an exception to the rule. Publishing something in the heat of the moment is a stupid idea; I have a few hours to calm down and see if my emotions dissipate. If you see this, I have not changed my outlook overnight and indeed – the UK government hates disabled people.</p>
<p>The ridiculous pressure the current Conservative Government are putting on those in need is sickening. It has been progressively getting worse for the last few years and sees no sign of stopping. Currently, we do not claim, nor are entitled to any benefits other than my daughter’s disability allowance. We are now used such things and are lucky to be in a position that we don’t rely on them.</p>
<p>With that said, we are starting to struggle to get regular, expected things from our local authority and this came to a head yesterday with an entitlement to incontinence products. For those of you that haven’t read many of my previous posts, nor know Lucie, she has a severely restricted understanding of the world. She doesn’t know what a toilet is, never mind about have the ability to use one.</p>
<p>My wife attended what was pitched to us as a ‘review’ of her current situation, and to see if she has the right prescription. Currently as it stands we receive 3 months supply of nappies at a time, this being working to a maximum of 4 nappies a day. If you’ve ever cared with a person that is unable to use the toilet, be it a baby, or any age really, you will know how many times a day you need to change an individual – and four is simply laughable.</p>
<p>We get through this by topping up our allocation with purchasing half this number again, every other delivery. So every six months roughly we are buying the same nappy, in bulk to make sure we don’t have any issues.</p>
<p>On attending the appointment, my wife was quizzed on how much Luice drinks, asked questions along the lines of “do you think that’s too much”, and made to generally feel horrible. They also question why Lucie had not been toilet trained and asked what we were doing to sort this situation out. My wife is now expected to reel off everything that is wrong with Lucie, justify what and how much Luice eats and drinks simply because that’s what’s expected.</p>
<p>As part of Lucie’s condition, she consumes quite a bit of high-calorie drinks along with milk with added fibre and calories. According to the local authority this doesn’t class as a drink, is in fact ‘food’ and doesn’t explain why we need more than three nappies a day.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right, the UK government now expects my nine-year-old daughter to only be changed twice a day! Frankly, this is a ridiculous amount of incontinence product and is not hygienic in the slightest. We must now pretty much double what the government gives us – out of our pocket. Simply because we are expected to toilet train a little girl with serve development delay who is non-communicative — not an impossible task, but not one that is going to happen overnight. It took me six months to teach her how to stir a spoon in a bowl.</p>
<p>You might argue that these types of purchases are exactly what the disability living allowance is for. But too retort, this is just the latest in a long line of cuts and removals of things we are expected to foot the bill for. The small amount we get goes in Lucie bank account and stays there to pay for long term care when we are too old to do so as I can’t rely on our government to do so any longer.</p>
<p>This current government is a shambles, aimed at looking after those that are in the best places and brushing everyone else under the carpet, and it makes me feel sick.</p>

<blockquote><p>Overall, our results showed that, while real-world social networks were positively associated with overall well-being, the use of Facebook was negatively associated with overall well-being. These results were particularly strong for mental health; most measures of Facebook use in one year predicted a decrease in mental health in a later year. We found consistently that both liking others’ content and clicking links significantly predicted a subsequent reduction in self-reported physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I can take it any more. Studies prove that Facebook makes you feel like crap. They do <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-51166339">awful</a> <a href="https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-marketing/advertising/facebook-refuses-ban-political-adverts-328619">thing</a> <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/leaked-memo-shows-facebook-executive-saying-company-was-responsible-donald-trump-getting-elected-1480946">after</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51200446">awful</a> <a href="https://consent.yahoo.com/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_0cf04ebd-67b5-4f06-97e6-00277b159d78&amp;lang=&amp;inline=false">thing</a>, yet people still use the garbage platform.</p>
<p>Facebook is the single worst thing to ever happen to the internet or society in general. It makes us sad, so narcissistic we annoy others, and splits us apart from other humans. All so we can share memes and check out or relatives we don’t care about enough to keep in touch with properly.</p>
<p>Doesn’t seem like a great exchange to me.</p>

So I have started to look at behaviour stats for my blog and try and work out some engagement with my readers, with a view in increasing feedback.</p>
<p>These sorts of stats <em>do</em> matter to me, because I want to see when and where people stop reading and understand how to keep people engaged with me. Not because I want to manipulate them and monetise them like the standard technology obsession. There is no attention economy here. I do want to build up a conversation with them and encourage replies to my posts.</p>
<p>I am not obsessed with this, but much as <a href="https://gabz.me/2020/01/10/engage-like-a.html">Gabz wrote about</a>, I want some real interaction from my posts. I desire conversation and even push back. Reading a post and nothing happening is as useful as a Twitter ‘like’. I want interaction from people, and the best way for me to do this is to look at where readers go to on my site and what clicks.</p>
<p>One down side is that Google Analytics is almost impossible to get the hang of straight away for a lowly blogger like me, so I might have to look at alternatives shortly. I have also found that lots of organic traffic from search seems to bounce straight off so I may have a task on my hands. But I’m going to try. In the mean time I am learning new skills and understanding user flow so this task is not a complete waste of time.</p>
<p>Stats still don’t rank high on my priorities for reader numbers or website clicks, Humans do – so how do I talk to them?</p>

<p>When I listen to other people on podcasts, and read others writing, they seem infinity more interesting than I think I am. With more to say on topics that I find really interesting. Does everyone feel like this? Is the fact that I am posting more made people realise how boring I am?

<p>I have never made a penny from writing, podcasting or making videos. I have never tried to really and never expect to. However, after writing for more than seven years, I have noticed that some posts get traction long after I have posted them and seem to be serving a purpose to people.</p>
<p>Guides like my repairing a DJI Spark controller get more than 100 views a day, they are helping people out, and I am happy about that. On digging into my site stats (I don’t do this very often) I discovered that 92% of these people are bouncing immediately off the site. They are merely using this page they found from Googling, getting the information and leaving.</p>
<p>I do get the very occasional email thanking me for publishing the information, one reader in particular, asked to send me some money because I solved his issue with his Lumia stuck when booting. However, most people are not reading very much.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with that; we all do it multiple times a day. However, these people are not engaging with me, not my followers and not likely to be. So I figured a small ad on pages like this wouldn’t hurt, it might give me a few pounds towards my site, but also might not.</p>
<p>Ghost makes it pretty easy for me to put a simple HTML block in the middle of posts that I want to try and monetise, so I’ve dropped a few into old posts that still get found on the net. What I don’t want is to have loads displaying all over the page, and ruin the content. I am now writing much more than I used so maybe one day I will make some money.</p>

<p>I still blame <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/the-biggest-change-to-birchtree-in-5-years/">Matt Birchler</a> for putting the idea in my head, I was quite happy on WordPress (not completely but pretty happy) and then he comes in and introduces <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost to me</a>, and I moved within a few days. On first look it seems like a ridiculously expensive option, and more suited to larger companies, but if you don’t want to splash out the $29/per month there are other options.</p>
<p>If you want to get a Ghost blog set up, its pretty easy to host it ‘yourself’,  here is a short guide on doing it on a Digital Ocean droplet.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-01-21-at-10.05.43-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9cb8be9542.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 01 21 at 10 05 43 1" width="1000" height="771" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Create A Droplet</h2>
<p>Signing up for a Digital Ocean account and creating a droplet is really straight forward. Most blogs will only need a $5 a month droplet unless you are getting serious traffic.</p>
<p>Click on Market place under ‘Choose an image’, this does allow you to choose loads of different options – but if you’re reading this guide you’ll find Ghost under ‘blogs and forums’. Once selected you will see a guide underneath detailing your requirements after your droplet is set up. On this page you will also find all information about the version being installed.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-01-21-at-10.06.10-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/91ebd54149.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 01 21 at 10 06 10 1" width="1000" height="771" border="0" />It won’t matter too much where your data centre is, so choose your preference – if things like GDPR and also government monitoring are important to you, then choose wisely. Give your droplet and name and then let it do its thing.</p>
<h2>After Creation</h2>
<p>Once completed, you will receive an email from Digital Ocean with your Droplet IP address and SSH password. Keep this information extremely safe and do not share with anyone.</p>
<h3>Point Your Domain</h3>
<p>On your Digital Ocean Project page, add your domain. This will populate the NS records and give you your name severs. This is more than likely going to be <code>ns1.digitalocean.com.</code>, <code>ns2.digitalocean.com.</code> and <code>ns3.digitalocean.com.</code> – add these to your domain settings.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-01-21-at-10.28.45-copy-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/884cf8140a.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 01 21 at 10 28 45 copy 1" width="1000" height="384" border="0" />Also add in an A record in Digital Ocean, with a host name of <code>@</code> and direct it to your IP address of the droplet. It is vitally important you wait for all changes to propagate before continuing otherwise you may have issues with setting up Ghost. I would advise you to wait 24 hours.</p>
<p>Once you are happy the domain information has properly propagated, continue to setting up the blog.<br /><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="pasted-image-0-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/28616a5c60.jpg" alt="Pasted image 0 1" width="599" height="247" border="0" /></p>
<h3>SSH Into Your Droplet</h3>
<p>Nothing will be live until you SSH into your droplet and set up Ghost. You should see a page telling you as mush if your domain has propagated correctly. Open your terminal and type in:<br /><code>ssh root@your-ip-address</code></p>
<p>The sever will ask for your password, copy and paste this in, and then immediately make you change it. You will need to put your current one in again, and then choose a new one – Keep this safe!</p>
<p>Once this is done Ghost will download updates and set itself up. Press Enter.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="pasted-image-0-2-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/54a20989c1.jpg" alt="Pasted image 0 2 1" width="598" height="149" border="0" /><br />You won’t need to put in any details about SQL databases or directories, you <em>will</em> have to put in your blog URL. Do this with the <code>https://</code> on and Ghost will set up your Let Encrypt certificate for you. This is where the installation will fall down if your domain is not properly propagated.</p>
<p>Ghost will be installed and set up at <code>/var/www/ghost</code></p>
<p>If everything goes ok, you will be given a url of <em>https://your-url/ghost</em>. Head to this address and set up your profile and blog title. If you want to migrate from WordPress, here’s some <a href="https://gr36.com/migrating-from-wordpress-to-ghost/">points to consider</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>There is a whole spectrum of issues that can come up for people regarding their significant other’s internet presence,” says Gray. “From things like, ‘Why are you always liking this model’s photographs?’ or ‘Why haven’t you been liking my posts lately?’ all the way to ‘I would really prefer if you didn’t scroll through your feed while we are eating together.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am always constantly surprised on the level of thought that goes into social media etiquette. On recently reshuffling my twitter and trying to move people into lists some people reached out and complained I unfollowed them – which I guess sis understandable. But couples have whole issues, and more than likely ended relationships, over their other half’s online footprints.</p>
<p>Personally I couldn’t care less one what others do and what pictures the doubles tap, but we do have a constant issue at home on the usage of tech in family times. My wife had a skill, that I don’t, to be able to watch a television program and also scroll through Facebook and also chat to her friends.</p>
<p>I am left with what I call ‘residual attention’ and it’s slim to none.</p>

     <p>I have been using <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/bear-the-serious/">Bear notes for years now</a>, it’s by far my favourite app for writing, and goes far beyond a simple notes app. The great thing is it keeps getting better and better without overly complicating things and becoming hard to use – not to mention it looks gorgeous.</p>
<p>The recent update to <a href="https://twitter.com/BearNotesApp/status/1219258627816665097">Version 1.7.8</a> brings in some improvements to tag icons but also an automated way to import your Apple Notes. This is something that has been lacking, not due to the developers, but to Apple’s locked down approach to notes, unlike importing from other apps which has existed for quite awhile.</p>
<p>This is a bit of a workaround, and unfortunately you can only do this process on Mac.</p>
<h2 id="mac-use-our-automator-workflow">Mac: use our Automator Workflow</h2>
<p><a href="https://sf-applications.s3.amazonaws.com/Bear/utils/NotesExporter.workflow.zip">Download our Automator Workflow</a>  Minimum system requirements: macOS 10.10 Yosemite<br />We built an Automator Workflow for macOS that can export all your Apple Notes as HTML files. This will include most note contents, but not all. See the breakdown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text, lists, and photos should be included</li>
<li>Note: only macOS 10.15 Catalina supports photo export. On earlier macOS versions, Apple Notes will not export photos</li>
<li>Task lists convert into bulleted lists</li>
<li>Rich media links will convert to plain text links</li>
<li>Non-photo attachments like PDFs or other files are not supported and will be excluded from export to HTML files. They will remain safely in Apple Notes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-use-this-automator-workflow">How to use this Automator Workflow</h3>
<ul>
<li>Download our AppleScript</li>
<li>Double-click it to open Automator</li>
<li>Press the Play button</li>
<li>Choose or create a new folder to store your exported Apple Notes</li>
<li>In Bear, click File &gt; Import Notes</li>
<li>In the dialog that opens, find the folder containing your exported notes</li>
<li>Select one or notes</li>
<li>(Optional) Adjust any import features such as whether to keep the original creation date, and whether to use the first line or file name for note titles</li>
<li>Click Import Notes</li>
</ul>

     <p>I’m going to be completely honest, this wasn’t easy for me – it was supposed to be straight forward, but everything that could have gone wrong did. I took the inspiration from <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/the-biggest-change-to-birchtree-in-5-years/">Matt Birchler</a> to post about my migration and the issues I faced in the hope someone else won’t run into the same.</p>
<h2 id="exporting-from-wordpress"><strong>Exporting From WordPress</strong></h2>
<p>The easiest way to do this is through the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ghost/">Ghost export plugin</a>. The plugin promises to download all of your posts, pages, and information into an easy to import ZIP file. Unfortunately, I haven’t met anyone yet that this has worked correctly.</p>
<p>In preparation, you will need to think about the categories you have on your blog. Ghost works on tags and not categories, so this information needs to be transferred before you export. Use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpcat2tag-importer/">Categories to Tags converter</a> plugin and run this once before export.</p>
<p>Also if you are a lone blogger, make sure your user account has the same email address as the one used on WordPress. If they are different the import will set up another User account that is locked. Deleting this user also deletes all of the posts, and short of transferring each post over individually, you are a bit stuck.</p>
<p>I had to switch to using the JSON option as the exporter kept timing out, even when I increased the memory available and also the time limit to infinite. This JSON file will only give you post and page content, not images to go along with it.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" title="imports-and-exports-in-Ghost-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3ad9506b40.jpg" alt="Imports and exports in Ghost 1" /></figure>
<h2 id="importing-to-ghost"><strong>Importing To Ghost</strong></h2>
<p>Once you’ve set up your blog on Ghost, log into the dashboard, go to Labs &gt; Import content &gt; Choose your file. The process is swift, and at the end, all of your posts and pages will be live on your site. If you’ve managed to export a zip file, you have nothing more to do other than check through your posts and make sure you are happy with them.</p>
<p>Due to my issues, I had the job of downloading all of my images from 7 years of posts and combing through each post to put them in. I tried to import all of my images into the recommended <code>content/images</code> folder; however, I used this opportunity to tidy up the folder.</p>
<p>There is no reason a bulk import of images wouldn’t work providing you keep the same structure as your WordPress blog. However, bear in mind that WordPress stores multiple versions of the same image at different sizes so your images folder is going to be overinflated – if storage space is an issue for you then consider doing some work to tidy up beforehand.</p>
<p>Now all I had to work about is a theme, and setting up my <a href="https://gr36.com/how-to-set-up-ghost-link-posts-using-canonical-url/">link posts</a>!</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" title="Blog-screenshot-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/40f2b21bb6.jpg" alt="Blog screenshot 1" /></figure>
<h2 id="improvements"><strong>Improvements</strong></h2>
<p>If I did this again, I would work a little more on editing the JSON to my liking and making everything run a little smoother. More information on doing your import can be found on the <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/api/v3/migration/">Ghost site.</a>  My move was time sensitive as my hosting was coming to an end, but given more time, I would work on a testing domain with Ghost and spend more time on the import and set up.</p>
<p>Exporting and importing from hosting platforms needs to become more uniform. Manton Reece, the creator of micro.blog, has called for an <a href="https://www.manton.org/2017/11/24/blog-archive-format.html">implemented standard</a> to make things much more comfortable to move around. It is times like this when you wish something existed. Many applications spend time working on importing from other options, so perhaps it’s time this becomes a consideration to those that run blogging platforms.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve always recorded my podcast weekly, edited and then released it a few days later. Four years later and I’ve never done anything differently, but the release of Charlie Chapman new podcast <a href="https://launchedfm.com/">Launched</a> has got me thinking about bingeing podcasts and when to release my own.</p>
<p>In general, I’ve never been swept away by podcasts. There are a few I have found and then gone back to listen to entire back catalogues, but shows like <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a> or the million other crime things have never been my thing. But I think these Audio dramas are created with this in mind, consumed in one go. Although recently I listened to the entirety of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07nkd84/episodes/downloads">The missing crytoqueen</a> on a long journey, and if I had to wait a week between episodes, it would have been a nightmare.</p>
<p>At the moment I am recording 2 or 3 in a week and then leaving a couple of weeks before I record any more. It is allowing me to spread out my work editing and book a few more guests or focus on other things. With this in mind, I <em>could</em> drop 2 or 3 all at once and then record the others in the next few weeks? Or should I have a mass record and then release 5 or 6 all at once? Perhaps I am putting too much thought into it.</p>
<p>It is a hard decision and one that Netflix and other streaming services are having to make. Do you release all episodes at once to create a real buzz, but then it be short-lived, or string it out for longer?</p>
<p>Many more shows fall back on series, or releasing several shows all at once and then working on a new run. Working like this seems based on the TV model, and if I may say so seems like an old school way of working. However, this does allow for better storytelling, and also should cut down on the editing if you are duplicating introductions, sound design and other things.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my brain is still leaning towards avoiding the idea of podcast ‘seasons’ – I don’t think it’s suited to anything other than audio dramas. Yet now I’m recording more conversations that are not time-sensitive, I’m more inclined to record a few and either release all at once rather than once a week. What do you think is best?</p>

<p>First off – this is no guarantee, but it should help.</p>
<p>The secret sauce to finding you iPhone after you’ve looked in the obvious places is Apples trusty ‘Find My’ App. Previously called find my iPhone, it will also track your Apple Watch, iPad, Mac’s and even AirPods. To do this is need location access and many people don’t give it enough access to be able to do the best job it can.</p>
<p>Privacy is a huge deal, and this is understandable, but should the worst happen you really want to track down your device as quickly and easily as possible. I have spent 20 mins rooting through my car, only to then trace my AirPods to being back at home on my desk – this tip may help recover your device and calm you down.</p>
<h2>Send Last Location</h2>
<p>The secret is allowing your device to update its location when it is used. This is stored by Apple and no one else – but it’s understandable if you don’t want to do this.</p>
<p>When you open the ‘Find my’ app for the first time you will be prompted to allow this. If you’ve missed it or now want to turn it on head to Settings &gt; Tap Your Name at the top &gt; Find My &gt; Find My Device &gt; and toggle on Send Last Location.</p>
<p>There is also an option to allow offline location. This will allow a location even if the device hasn’t got a data connection by pinging other Apple devices around it. This is similar to how Tile works and is linked to the much rumour Apple version.</p>
<p>You could also consider sharing your location with friends of family members so they can also track down devices for you, however this has its own pitfalls!</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When I picked up the very first iPad on the day of the launch, I knew this device would open a different world. Universally panned as bigger iPhone, many critics didn’t see a future for a device type already tried a few times over. However, Apple knew, as well as I did, that this market would open up given enough time.</p>
<p>Yet this first device I held in my hand had a small market and very few uses. Apple touted a future of computing filled with devices such as these, and even if you choose to slash for the accompanying keyboard dock, there still wasn’t much you could do on an iPad – short of it being indeed a bigger iPhone.</p>
<p>With this, the vast majority of usage became consumption, social media browsing, watching a video and surfing the web. Sure it replaced many seldom-used laptops in people homes, but it didn’t do much more to show us the future. Users saw no reason to upgrade, and while a few began to see the potential as the iPad became sleeker and more powerful. It wasn’t until I picked up an iPad Air that I had to work on, that posts like Federico’s <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-2-review-why-the-ipad-became-my-main-computer/">initial deluge of guides</a> on MacStories opened the floodgates.</p>
<p>My rage quitting of the iPad dragged out longer than it should do and came to a head earlier this year. I shared <a href="https://gr36.com/today-is-the-day-i-quit-the-ipad/">my disappointment in the failures of iOS</a> and also my change in circumstances that lead to its demise in my life. The iPad Pro was no longer the device I enjoyed using and no longer one my life could support. I couldn’t justify a more than £1300 investment to need a Mac around as well. I don’t regret using the iPad as my computer; ultimately if my life remained as nomadic as it once was, I might have remained a die-hard user.</p>
<p>However, a brand new 10.2 iPad <a href="https://amzn.to/36fhkbj">is £289 at time of writing</a>, a deal that is hard to turn down. I don’t need an iPad to be a working machine any longer; I need it to fill a gap of reading blog posts, my pocket feed and watching videos when I want to relax. So the iPad returns to its starting position. Nestled in among other Apple devices, and one I use to consume. Waiting its turn amongst threes Macs and an iPhone. Sure I could pick up a pencil and a keyboard to go with it – but there is little point as the iPad has gone full circle.</p>

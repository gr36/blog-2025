<p>A few years ago I used to write a lot about Lucie. Mention her a lot in posts about my life and also wrote a few from her perspective. Making light of situations when in reality it was my way of coping with feelings and emotions.</p>
<p>The greatest issue of which is lost sleep, and in a cruel twits of fate as I lay wide awake at a ridiculous time of the morning an old post shows up on <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-12-20-day-one-review/">Day One</a> and it seems nothing has changed in two years.</p>
<p>Lucie has <a href="https://gr36.com/2016-12-27-hello-4am/">always been up at silly times of the day</a> and I don’t think it’s ever going to change. Sleep is something I now have a very strange relationship with, all thanks to my daughter who appears to not need any! As much as we try and provide as least distraction as possible, all the safety features and ridiculous amount of medication – her sleep is a constant issue. This invariably means me laying awake and writing blog posts or getting up and trying to mediate the noise so no one else wakes up.</p>
<p>I still have yet to work out the magic combination that allows us to get a reasonable about of sleep. Where’s as ‘normal’ children will have a bad nights sleep every so often, we are the reverse. We get a full night sleep once an a blue mood and rely on each other to keep going. Self medicating with coffee is perhaps not the answer but I did get a nice coffee machine for Christmas so it might help a little.</p>
<p>Think about me when you’re all tucked up in bed and relaxing. I will be the one chasing my daughter around the house to stop her working on a new techno beat by smashing two toys together.</p>

<p>For years of my life I have been consuming the worst kind of blog posts. You know the ones – “successful people do this” or “10 task manager tricks to make you better”. I’ve read so many of these that Pocket surfaces what seems like every version of them on the planet. I’ve watched <a href="/2018-04-04-productivity-set-up-videos/">hundreds of videos</a> on the subject, spent loads of money on apps, and caused my self so much stress. All because I wanted to be better, do more, and I was convinced the secret was out there somewhere.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whilst putting the world to rights on the Outline podcast, Daryl asked me if I am ever happy with my set up. Of course the answer is no! I am never happy and constantly try and improve my productivity and set up. – Greg Morris, <a href="/2018-04-04-productivity-set-up-videos/">The Strange World Of Productivity Set Up Videos.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>When all along there was a pretty simple word that allowed me to be more productive, actually achieve more, and work much smarter. That word was NO – and it came as a reply to many questions that started with the phrase “could you just”.</p>
<p>You see I could “just do this” and “see if I could do that” but in reality I couldn’t do anything more than I already did. It wasn’t more tasks I needed, it was better tasks and a higher outcome from them. There is no quick and easy step, there is no golden secret waiting in all of these posts. If there were tips around to suddenly ‘turbocharge’ your productivity then everyone would know it, and there would be no need for literally millions of words on the subject.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am a robot, programmed to obliterate my to-do list. – David Sbarra, <a href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/i-trained-myself-to-be-less-busy-and-it-dramatically-improved-my-life">I trained myself to be less busy — and it dramatically improved my life</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>Ditched GTD</h2>
<p>The first step was to get rid of my habit of writing everything into my task manger. I know people swear by the Getting Things Done principles, but if it’s in the task list it feels as though you now <em>have</em> to do it. That’s not to say don’t write down things that you may forget, but actually think about what you are putting in there.</p>
<p>Should I be doing this?<br />
Who should be doing this?<br />
What is the benefit to me?<br />
What is the benefit to a larger goal?</p>
<p>If it simply doesn’t seem relevant, it doesn’t go in, simple. I’ve become much more <a href="https://amzn.to/2Rfn4NZ">focused on Essentialism</a>, and surprisingly managed to squeeze more into my day. Simply because I’ve said no to things that are not going to benefit me or those around me, or that I simply can get out of doing. I’ve learnt to focus my time onto things that really need doing, and filled in the smaller tasks around me.</p>

<p>I have never shared anything like this before. Admittedly I share quite a lot but my journal entries <sup><a class="footnote" href="https://gr36.com/one-journal-snippet/1">1</a></sup> are deeply private and actually embarrassing in some instances. Yet I wrote this short snippet in today and wanted to share it with whoever reads my blog.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m writing these things for future me to read and understand this is where you made your stand. This is the lowest point that you will build from, no more stress, no more worry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of the time I don’t even realise what I am writing until I read it back. I have got into the habit of sitting down for 20mins and just letting my fingers type away and express the way the day has gone. Some times it makes little sense but it is extremely beneficial to free my mind of some feelings and thoughts.</p>
<p>I do read them back from time to time, often using the ‘on this day’ feature, as it is useful to see if I have been here before. If I have made improvements from other periods in my life, or if I can learn anything to help the ‘current me’.</p>
<p>Unfortunately at the moment I am reading and also writing the same sort of things I did at this point last year. Headaches, stress and low motivation blighting what should be a happy time of year. Don’t get me wrong I am really looking forward to spending the next 10 days relaxing, exercising, meditating and with my family.</p>
<p>However this definitely is my time to build ready for 2019. I am determined to make this a great year (I know I say this every year). I am genuinely excited to achieve more, work smarter <sup><a class="footnote" href="https://gr36.com/one-journal-snippet/2">2</a></sup> and publish more.</p>

<p>Last week we moved house. I’m not sure what possessed us to do this a week before Christmas, but we didn’t have much choice in the matter. The general belief is that this is one of the most stressful things to do, yet we project managed our way though it and it went brilliantly. Apart from one small detail – we had no internet connection or TV for a whole week.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, it is going to be great once it is installed, we have this fancy Fibre To The Property (FTP) connection, so speeds will be ridiculous. So going forward things are going to be much better, but it is only in times like this that you realise just how much you rely on an internet connection. It has also made me realise just how much interruption TV and web usage interferes in our lives.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am an exception to the rule, but I have my doubts. I am <em>very</em> connected, with podcasting, writing and interacting on social media, there is barely a time I am bored. Yet being without Television has made us interact more as a family. For the past week we have simply been in each others company – talked, played and actually been bored together. Both myself and my wife have meditated more, eaten better and been present at every moment for our children.</p>
<p>We did this before, we make a point of eating meals together, doing homework and all these great family things. Although in the past how much of this has been undermined by a background noise of TV or music? Just the sheer presence of these things is bound to have an effect. Although I am really excited to get an internet connection back, I am really pleased this has happened. If only to draw attention to our usage of electronic entertainment, and build habits that will carry on in our new home.</p>

<p>I know this might sound surprising and bordering on impossible, but over the past couple of weeks I think I have discovered a huge trigger for my occasional depressive periods.</p>
<p>Generally speaking I am, what my wife would call “annoyingly positive”, but much of my time is inter-spliced with darker periods. I don’t suffer like some people do, but for more than 10 years I have felt like I am riding a roller coaster. Periods of ups and downs that seem to happen with no real pattern. Resent changes in my life have required me to readdress and look at many areas of my life, and now I realise that this is very much tied to my feeling of self worth and being appreciated.</p>
<p>I would like to think that I work hard at everything I do, it doesn’t matter if it’s podcasting, in the gym, looking after my family or indeed my professional life. I don’t do it for money, fame, titles, cars, house or anything else material, yet a simple well done and a bit of appreciation is all I crave. I don’t need to be held up and rewarded, but I think I’m not alone when I say – just feeling part of a team goes a long way.</p>
<p>It certainly would appear that it isn’t just me, after doing some reach on the subject, Johann Hari’s book <a href="https://thelostconnections.com/">Lost Connections</a> points to similar links to depression. Feelings of isolation, lost community and self worth are, in his opinion, the leading cause of a ‘depression epidemic’. I cant speak to this applying to everyone, but it is proving a massive factor for me. I am already aware I spend <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-10-28-too-much-time-alone/">too much time alone</a>, which does <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-11-13-outgoing-introvert/">help me to some degree</a> – but feelings of self worth and isolation may be pulling me down more than I think.</p>

<p>So, here’s the thing. I receive loads of emails from random PR companies to test products, not as many as real tech reviewers, but enough. They claim to give you free products, but actually want you to pay for them first. I’ve been burnt a few times so typically decline. However I was intrigued to try some AirPods alternatives and I wish I hadn’t bothered.</p>
<p>That isn’t to say there aren’t earbuds out there that can live up to the functionality of Apples foray into true wireless. It is simply the fact that I see so many claim that they are alternatives when in reality they are not even comparable. These Miyun versions are no exception, and no hidden gem.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-06-22-mjyun-wireless-case-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/32d7980365.jpg" alt="2018 06 22 mjyun wireless case 1" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<p>Indeed they are a fraction of the price, because frankly there is no getting around the fact that many of the new breed of truly wireless earbuds are eye wateringly expensive. I didn’t expect them to be equal, but in true B movie style, I expected them to at least be somewhere near.</p>
<p>They come in a nice, robust case, offering a neat charging solution with supplied micro USB cable. The build quality feels surprisingly robust to a level that I am frankly astonished at. With that said, Apple resort to using a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/AirPods">ridiculous amount of glue</a>, so I would expect these to be no different, an illusion of quality if you will.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Sound</strong></strong></h2>
<p>As with all earphones this is the proof of everything, the reason you by them, but it’s difficult to know where to start. The sound quality is terrible and there is no getting around it. Due to the strange twist you do when putting the earbuds in your ears the seal seems to be pretty good and cuts out lots of background noise. Unfortunately they haven’t taken advantage of this and everything sounds very shallow and distant.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-06-22-mjyun-wireless-blackberry-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/55a2674486.jpg" alt="2018 06 22 mjyun wireless blackberry 1" width="599" height="337" border="0" /></p>
<p>The bass levels are non existent and everything else seems to be forced into a much higher range than it should be. Spoken word such as podcasts and audio books are the most noticeable and make all voices sound tinny and sometimes uncomfortably high pitched.</p>
<p>Couple this with the fact that audio moves around from ear to ear and you have a very disappointing experience. I realise that these are very very cheap for true wireless earphones, but I would save your money and purchase something better sounding with wires!</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Connection Issues</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The ease of initial connection is where most cheap wireless headphones fall down. Let’s not over inflate the issue, most users are ou fait with heading to your phones setting to set up and pair. Yet for some reason this is overly complicated with a dance of buttons and connecting you must jump through simply to listen. A successful connection is following a predetermined path of connecting to one earbud, and then the other connecting to it. Stray too far from this path and resetting is your only option, condemned to try again until the Bluetooth gods accept your offering.</p>
<p>As annoying as snagging a cable is, if this is your alternative I think I would rather sit in silence. There are alternatives to AirPods out there, but these cheap offers are simply not it. I have <a href="https://www.coolsmartphone.com/2016/10/17/aukey-wireless-enough-going/">bought and enjoyed cheap Bluetooth headphones before</a> with a wire between them, removing this has proved so overly complicated that it is simply not worth the hassle. Save up, or save your time – the choice is yours.</p>

<p>Once upon a time I would ‘review’ all of my tech purchases, post several hundred if not thousand words of my thoughts and a dive into the device. For the last two models of iPad I have simply shared my thoughts through text and also <a href="https://byodpodcast.com/">podcast</a>. There are enough reviews out there for you to find out the specs and technology publication opinions – but now more than ever its important to find out the thoughts of people that actually use the device in question. Well here are mine.</p>
<p>All of the improvements Apple made to this years iPad Pro when looked at individually look quite trivial. They upgraded the internals and brought the design inline with their modern phones, removing the home button, and incorporating FaceID. Both of these things didn’t need an anylist to predict, but they have both lead to some major changes to actually using the iPad and improve almost everything about the experience. Did the change in design lead to the changes in Apple Pencil and Keyboard, or did they lead the design choices. While you argue about swings and roundabouts – I’ll tell you what’s improved and ultimately why that matters.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-11-09-iPad-pro-review-hero-1-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7377e48bc7.jpg" alt="2018 11 09 iPad pro review hero 1 1" width="600" height="300" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2>
<p>The ‘edge to edge’ screen retains some bezel around the edges, which is the best of what could have been a bad situation. All the palm rejection in the world can’t mediate holding a device to read and touching the screen constantly. However the new squared off design actually makes it much easier to handle the device. It feels almost like science fiction and without doubt almost what every device manufacturer shoots for when trying to design a perfect tablet. It’s not quite a slab of glass, but its not far off.</p>
<p>The new design is very reminiscent of an older iPhone 5 design, but with a modern feel. It also in some respects feels like a reference design for future products without hardware limitations. I am using the 11” version and it feels much larger than it actually is, a nice big screen which is still very portable and easy to also use as a consumption device.</p>
<p>The smart connector has moved to the back of the device, presumably allowing for a more device ecosystem of accessories. Very few accessories appeared for the previous side mounted version, and unfortunately I don’t seem many flooding the market with this one. Hopefully I will be disappointed, but this does allow for a much better connection using a rediculous number of magnets and an improvement to the first party keyboard.</p>
<h2><strong>Folio Keyboard</strong></h2>
<p>I have loved and loathed the Smart Keyboard in <a href="/2018-11-17-ipad-smart-keyboard/">equal amounts over the last two years</a>. The keyboard itself is great, I really enjoy typing on it, but the origami style always felt strange and the back of my iPad felt exposed. The Smart Folio solves both of these problems and I am really enjoying the improvements.</p>
<p>If you hate the keys on the previous version, you’re going to feel the same about the new one. However to me the keys feel more robust and seem to have further travel – combined with much loader clicking!</p>
<p>Using the iPad in the Smart Folio but without the keyboard feels very un-Apple like to me. For all its weirdness at least the origami needed for the Smart Keyboard hid away the keys when not in use, all be it at the expense of a strange hump on the front. The weirdness is mediated a little by how simple it is to remove the Smart Folio, and actually feel the device as Apple intended. I find myself pooping the iPad Pro out of the case when using the pencil or just browsing more than I expected.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-11-10-writing-pencil-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/879a8d56f2.jpg" alt="2018 11 10 writing pencil 1" width="599" height="399" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>New Apple Pencil</strong></h2>
<p>Apples stylus (don’t call it a stylus) is a great tool to have in my professional life, but not something I would considering buying for personal use. The first version was something I purchased and found a use for, and spent most of its time hiding in my bag for the odd time I would need to sign something. It was too long, didn’t really fit anywhere to store it and you felt silly charging it.</p>
<p>The second version mediates almost all of those issues, except the use case. Unless you’re going to draw quite often the £130 price tag will make most people baulk – the £30 price increase adds in quite a few features but wont work with any other hardware at this moment in time.</p>
<p>The second generation is shorter, more balanced and flat on one side. Making it more pencil like, and also allowing it to stick to the side of the iPad and wirelessly charge. Not only removing the need to look like a idiot every time you charge the thing, but also giving it a place to be stored and removing the anxiety enduceing end cap.</p>
<h2><strong>USB-C</strong></h2>
<p>The move away from Lightning hasn’t added any extra features to the iPad, but has made them more accessible and dare I say it interesting. It is slightly strange to find the port isn’t a Thunderbolt 3 variant, but is still capable of supporting an external display up to 5k.</p>
<p>Having tested several apps it is clear nothing extra stands out but it has allowed me to use my already amassed selection of USB-C cables from my MacBook Pro. Cheaper option for USB-C to HDMI and also dongles mean the dream of not carrying a laptop at all are getting a whole lot closer.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The 2018 iPad has proved to be a worthy upgrade <em><em>for me</em></em>, it has improved on lots of little things that while weren’t detrimental, they where annoying.</p>
<p>With that said Apples recent trend of increasing the price and providing less equipment in the box is getting close to putting me off. All of the iPad’s have increased in price, there is no headphone dongle, no spare Apple Pencil tips and nothing to say Apple wont continue this trend. If asked what iPad should I buy, I would give most users the choice between the £329 iPad and the much cheaper 10.5” iPad pro.</p>
<p>As good as it is, and it really is good, I view this iPad as even a notch above pro. It is the early adopter or hardcore users iPad, not the one for everyone.</p>

<p>For longer than I care to remember, or admit to, I have been searching for the perfect task manager. I am definitely not alone in the feeling that there wasn’t a service that seemed to fit. <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-01-14-todoist-review/">Todoist</a> almost got there, Things 3 is pretty good, but no service ticked all the boxes and I went backwards and forwards between them more than a handful of times. Thankfully I think I’ve cracked it, and it’s an add on service for the stock reminders app – I think Goodtasks3 is the perfect solution.</p>
<p>For almost as long as I’ve been switching task manager apps, Apple’s reminders app has been in desperate need of an overhaul. Everyone admits it, yet it still has a completely different UI to every other app and hasn’t received the level of attention given to Notes or Music. Frankly it isn’t a very good iOS citizen either. Countless third party apps put it to shame, offering a much better service, miles better design and huge improvements in user experience.</p>
<p>Although what Apple reminders lacks in appeal it makes it for in utility, it’s ingrained in almost every part of iOS and allows for much better task input. It just need some so called ‘power user’ options and easer task input. This is where GoodTask 3 comes in. Once granted access to your stock reminders it can be used to sort, display, set up and complete tasks alongside Apple’s own app.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Smart Lists</strong></strong></h2>
<p>One of my favourite functions are smart lists, allowing for filtering into different options based on numerous filters either individually or combined. For example I have set up smart lists to mimick my typical Todoist home screen, with an Inbox, Today overview and others based on reminder topic – Work, Home etc.</p>
<p>GoodTask achieves this by putting text in the title or notes of each reminder. A hashtag or keyword in the task notes doesn’t clog up lists if you choose to also use the Apple app, but allows for much more flexibility in task types. Separating work and home, short and long term goals, whatever you are trying to achieve. Because of how easy task input is I have achieved much more in the last few months.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-11-09-goodtasks3-screenshots-1-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b152a8bfb5.jpg" alt="2018 11 09 goodtasks3 screenshots 1 1" width="1000" height="478" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong><strong>Task Input</strong></strong></h2>
<p>Inputting tasks becomes much easier with quick actions and contextual awareness. This is something really lacking from even advanced task managers like Things 3. Once you have experienced the natural input of Todoist it is really hard to go elsewhere. Tap the plus icon in GoodTask and you can use almost all of the same options. By default it will pick out reminder titles, alert requests and also due dates. Although just bare in mind you will need to delve into settings if you don’t use American date structures.</p>
<p>This is also where quick actions come in, these give the ability to tap on predefined options for task labels, alert options and also adding to shared lists. These can be customised until your heart is content and make GoodTask infinitely more powerful the more work you put in.</p>
<p>All of these options are great, but the real beauty of adopting GoodTask is the fact that all the other options for inputting regular reminders are also open to you. Use Siri on any device and simply ask it to remind you. No keywords, no Shortcuts, no awkward phrasing and nothing to worry about. Tasks will show in the stock app and also GoodTask 3, where you can add in extra details and labelling.</p>
<p>I have adopted a <a href="http://rocketpanda.net/2018/10/gtd-series-intro/">GTD approach</a> and set up an Inbox smart list where every reminder without a due date, or tag ends up. Allowing me to brain dump everything I wish to do, and worry about when and how later on. GoodTask 3 will allow you to get many of the power user features with all of the benefits of a first party app and it is highly recommended.</p>

<p>I could never work out what was so magic about Apple’s Keyboard, nor the mouse to a lesser extent. It didn’t do anything out of the ordinary, didn’t wow me with features and certainly didn’t do any magic, bar make your bank balance smaller. At least the Smart Keyboard was reasonably smart. Not in a literal sense, it didn’t actually learn anything but it looked kind of cool and folded smartly into a neat(ish) package.</p>
<p>The Smart Keyboard for the iPad has gotten quite a lot of stick over the years it has been on the market. It has been trounced for not being back lit, not being wide enough and being a bit ugly. Yet I have a love for it, despite its un-smartness, and it is by far my most used keyboard for the last few years.</p>
<p>Mainly because it so dam straight forward to use. Once attached to the iPad you don’t have to worry about pairing it, charging it, or any other weirdness that always happens with third party keyboards. No settings to delve into, no keys that work on some devices and not others, and you don’t have to deal with micro USB ever again!</p>
<p>With all this said there are some options I would like to see, some dedicated iOS buttons such as media controls, or dam it even a function row. What I don’t want is for Apple to start making the smartkeyboard backlit and ruin its greatest feature – portability.</p>
<p>The new 11” version has already changed into a folio case, with two questionable viewing angels. Whilst it is great to finally cover the back of my iPad it does add more bulk. The Smart keyboard as it stands should always remain the best option for something light and easy to use, but that’s not to stop Apple making other versions. It gets a lot of stick but I enjoy using it daily – a little ode to the not so Smart Keyboard.</p>

<p>I have no issue with sharing myself and my life in person or online. I have a job in sales, I podcast all the time, yet there is something you may not know about me – I am actually really introverted.</p>
<p>Much much less than I used to be, but it seems to be hard for people to wrap their head around it. I am sure many people would label me as much more outgoing than I actually am, and I used to worry about it quite a lot.</p>
<p>I have what I describe as an extrovert battery, and it only lasts so long. I spend <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-10-28-too-much-time-alone/">lots of my time alone</a> preparing for the times I need to be more social. I haven’t quite got the time frame down yet, but when working for long periods or spending lots of time with others, around late afternoon I start to flag.</p>
<blockquote><p>Introverts get their energy by being alone or in small groups, while extroverts get their energy from larger groups of people. – <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147750/social-anxiety-psychology-how-to-be-yourself-ellen-hendriksen-interview">Ellen Hendriksen</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I didn’t even realise this was normal until very recently. I thought introverts were those that shy away from everything and were a little socially awkward. Personality traits are often miss understood like this, but all I know is that I feel drained and often need some quiet time to simply recharge.</p>
<p>I thrive in peace and quiet where I can focus, but love interacting with others and conversing. I’m perfectly happy being the centre of attention, but not for too long and providing I get some down time. I guess I need to look after my little extrovert battery, make sure it goes through it’s charge cycles correctly and preserve its longevity.</p>

     <p>Except I didn’t, I sat at my desk and turned on my iPad. Open up <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/finding-a-use/">Drafts</a> and simply typed a few words into the endless posts I have been working on for ages and then opened Twitter. The same Twitter I have been staring at for 20mins previously, before getting to the end of the new posts in the Apple sub-Reddit.</p><p>This has been my life for the past few weeks, since spending obscene amounts of money on the iPhone XS I think I have been searching to add in value. Never bored, never happy to sit and think about things as I would do even a month ago.

Well depending on who you listen to it’s just the way of the world now, or the worse thing to happen to the world in a long time. I would lean more towards the latter opinion – but I just can’t help myself. It’s not the phones fault, it’s not the app makers fault (well maybe a little) it is mine. I don’t want to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/20/turning-smartphone-greyscale-attention-distraction-colour">turn my phone grayscale</a>, remove loads of apps or god forbid <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-10-15-the-new-palm-is-a-tiny-phone-to-keep-you-away-from-your-phone-the-verge/">buy a dumb phone</a>. I love having a computer in my pocket and information at my finger tips, but I need to find some kind of solution.</p><p>Intentional Twitter usage seems to have gone by the way side and I am becoming something that I detest. Hopefully by simply acknowledging my tendency to do this more often will help break the cycle, because something has to give. I even contemplated <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-finally-deletedfacebook/">logging into Facebook</a> and this gave me the wake up call I needed. At least I did write a blog post in the end, but not about what I intended to, I can’t even remember my idea.</p>

<p>After a few days of false information, forum posts that have half truths in them and a couple of telephone calls – I have managed to set up my iPhone XS with dual sims and here is how to do it.</p>
<h2><strong>Preparation</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to go dual sim on your iPhone XS there are a few ways, but one of your sims is going to have to become an eSim. This technology isn’t new but Apple are the first to do it mass market and in the UK it is only supported by EE at the moment. Unfortunately this is only currently available for pay monthly personal tariffs but they claim to be expanding the roll out in the coming months. So you won’t have the option on pay as you go, flex or business accounts.</p>
<h2><strong>Get An eSim</strong></h2>
<p>If you are in the market for a new contract, then one from EE might be the best way forward, simply ask them for an eSim instead of a regular sim and you’re all set. Keep in mind that if the second sim you wish to use is for a different network then you will need to wait 6 months and request your phone to be unlocked. If both accounts are on EE, simply put your physical sim in and go through the set up options to assign a primary and secondary number.</p>
<h2><strong>Transfer To An eSim</strong></h2>
<p>If you have an unlocked phone (like me) or choose to get your iPhone XS unlocked after 6 months, you will need to transfer your EE regular sim to an eSim. To do this you will need an eSim pack, with a QR code to scan. You can get these in stores, or the easiest way is to call 150 and request one. You should get this in the post the next day so you wont have to wait too long, the people on the phone I spoke to are very knowledgeable and will guide you through the process as in-depth as you wish.</p>
<p>Make sure you request a replacement eSim pack as this will be either sent with your number attached or without a number at all. Once this arrives head into the settings on iOS 12.1 and go to Mobile Data &gt; Add data plan. This is where you scan your QR code and are guided through the set up process, your phone might get a bit confused once finished, so pop out your standard sim and reboot your phone. EE state up to 24hours for activating the eSIm, but in reality you should be set up in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps you out a little as most info online is very generalised. If you need help in setting up the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT209044">primary and secondary options</a> in iOS head over to Apple support pages for a great explainer.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>With all the drama surrounding iPad reviews circling again I posed myself a little thought experiment. When all is said and done, and I could only choose one device to ‘work on’ forever – what device would it be?</p>
<p>It took me some time to run through all possibilities, come up with a few work arounds and a little bit of work to stay neutral. Surprisingly, I think I would have to choose a MacBook. Simply because I know with 100% certainty I can get 100% of everything done on a MacBook. Unfortunately at this moment in time I can’t say that about the iPad.</p>
<p>That isn’t to say the iPad is useless. I still choose to use it for the vast majority of my daily tasks. It is far more powerful, versatile, portable and has better battery life than almost any laptop on the market. Combine that the fact that honestly I much prefer working on iOS to macOS and I would choose the iPad most of the time. What is different to all of these review posted at the moment, is that I wouldn’t claim either of these machines are useless.</p>
<p>What many reviews are pointing to is the same arguments that we had when the original iPad Pro was released. If it doesn’t work for you that’s ok, choose a MacBook or an iMac or a Windows machine. That is perfectly ok and more power to you. However that doesn’t make the other options useless for others. Let’s all choose the machine that fits in best with our workflow and requirements and carry on. I am just thankful that all of these options exist in a modern ecosystem full of potential.</p>
<p>The new iPad Pro no doubt will move even closer to me dropping a laptop, if I can just work out podcasting! For more thoughts, check out <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-11-07-GR36-01/">my solo podcast</a> launched today.</p>

<p>The opinions on Agenda app range from excitement to confusion but it has caused quite a stir in iOS productivity circles. The developers are constantly improving the app and there are now a bunch of automation options available for Agenda via x-callback URL.</p>
<p>You can use these in Shortcuts or a whole range of automation apps and here is a breakdown of what you can do.</p>
<h2>Open</h2>
<p>On-the-agenda view<br />
<code>agenda://x-callback-url/on-the-agenda<br />
</code></p>
<p>Open the Today overview<br />
<code>agenda://x-callback-url/today<br />
</code></p>
<p>Open a project<br />
<code>agenda://x-callback-url/open-project?title=[project title]<br />
</code></p>
<p>Open a note<br />
<code>agenda://x-callback-url/open-note?title=[title text]<br />
</code></p>
<h2>Create</h2>
<p>Create a new note<br />
<code>agenda://x-callback-url/create-note?project-title=[project name]&amp;title=[title text]&amp;text=[body text]<br />
</code></p>
<p>Append to existing note<br />
<code>agenda://x-callback-url/append-to-note?title=[title text]&amp;text=[body text]<br />
</code></p>
<h2>Optional extras</h2>
<p>Add in extras to the end of the url if you need some more control. These are not mandatory.</p>
<p>On the agenda<br />
<code>&amp;on-the-agenda=[true or false]<br />
</code></p>
<p>Specific date<br />
<code>&amp;date=[year]-[month]-[day]<br />
</code></p>
<p>Start and/or end dates<br />
<code>&amp;start-date=yesterday&amp;end-date=tomorrow<br />
</code></p>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p><code>agenda://x-callback-url/create-note?project-title=My%20Project&amp;title=New%20Note&amp;text=Hello%20World&amp;on-the-agenda=true&amp;date=2018-03-12<br />
</code></p>
<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p><code>agenda://x-callback-url/create-note?project-title=Blogposts&amp;title=New%20Post29&amp;text=Hello%20World&amp;on-the-agenda=false&amp;start-date=yesterday&amp;end-date=tomorrow</code></p>

<p>On the second Friday of the month I add up all my mileage and there is never a time when the total doesn’t scare me. It’s always north of 2500 miles a month and I’m starting to wonder if that’s good for me.</p>
<p>I am sure there are people that do many more, yet presuming I take the regular 1 month off throughout the year. I spend at least 27,000 miles alone just driving. Taking out all traffic jams and other hold ups and accounting for me travelling everywhere at 60mph – that’s 458hours of my year. 19 whole days!!</p>
<p>Add into this time spent eating, waiting for appointments or alone in a hotel room and it’s starting to look pretty scary. I love my job but perhaps I spend too much time alone.</p>
<p>My time is never wasted, I spend all of this time listening to podcasts and audio books – as Aubrey Marcus says <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B076Z6KFWL/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1?tag=gr36-21">practicing mindfillness</a>. Yet I still feel like I spend too much time alone and long term this isn’t good for me. I guess maximising the time I am around people is the key to improving myself.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks there has been a great <a href="https://marco.org/2018/10/09/infograph-legibility">deal of negativity</a> about Apple Watch faces. Much like criticism of the <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-04-05-apple-watch-honeycomb/">honeycomb layout</a>, I have no idea why it has taken 4 iterations of the Apple Watch for users to start moaning about custom watch faces, but they are now very vocal.</p>
<p>I must outline that I say <em>users</em> with a broad stroke, because some of those most critical of the first party faces are not Apple Watch users at all. I do agree with some of the criticism though, as since the small changes to Apple Watch face design in watchOS5 I can’t settle on just one.</p>
<p>I have used the same watch face for almost the entire time I have owned one (since launch bar about 4 weeks of vacation before the last version). My only issues with the current watch faces are that too many of them are appealing but fall short in some way. Some are overly complex and feature too much information, some fall short of not having enough complications, and unfortunately some are just not my cup of tea at all.</p>
<p>However it must be said that I don’t think allowing developers to create a huge number of faces to choose from would fix many of the issues. In actual fact I think it might make choices much worse. If Apple were to relinquish some control over the face they must insist on a certain level of complication use or design, both of which I have doubts if that would even be possible to control.</p>
<p>Much like with the iPhone home screen users must relinquish their personal tastes to a certain extent and accept the design choices Apple makes. Although with the ‘most personal product’ I think some wiggle room is needed. There <em>are</em> too many faces with a similar design, and there <em>are</em> areas to hugely improve, but my solution is to use several for different situations and swipe between them. So I don’t need to settle on one watch face anymore.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I remember getting my very first Android phone. After using iPhones for a very long time I switched to the new comer in town. The Galaxy S was shiny and new, and all I had to worry about was putting my sim in and transferring my contacts. I felt like I was some kind of rebel, sporting an underdog and not conforming to convention.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, even transferring contacts was pretty tricky at the time as Apple were even more locked down that they are now and I opted to just write them all down and type them back in. This was the most complicated part of the process, but these simple days are long gone. You must have a serious desire to reach escape velocity now, and it feels a little bit claustrophobic.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>App Investment</strong></strong></h2>
<p>After even a small amount of time spent using iOS there can be a considerable investment in applications. The average spend on iOS users in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/21/iphone-average-app-spending-2016/">US is $40 a year</a>, all of this investment is useless when switching to a different OS. Several apps have introduced subscription services that will in theory work cross platform, this will help to mediate those issues. However there is no guarantee that there is even apps available on alternative platforms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately many of the high profile applications that have adopted this model are simply not available on other platforms. Granted the average Joe may have nothing to worry about other than than their phone. However more and more people are buying Apple Watches, iPads and Apple TVs than you think. These are satellite devices to everyone and all aid to keep customers from leaving.</p>
<p>No longer is the only investment a mobile phone and perhaps a few accessories. Manufacturers are creating a whole range of devices with different levels of pull, designed to make the overall experience as good as possible. It is without doubt that certain devices have more pull than other devices – higher gravity if you will. So reaching that escape velocity from iOS is much harder when you take into account everything that goes with it. Arguably I would miss the connivence of AirPods and the ease of a cellular Apple Watch (these are my favourite Apple devices over the last few years) more than an iPhone.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only option is just accept my fate <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/leaning-into-the-apple-lock-in/">and lean in</a>? I have already embraced the fact that unless something drastic changes it would be almost impossible for me to switch <em><em>everything</em></em> but not impossible for me to change some things. The trick is to not let the brand overtake your opinions, I try very hard to be open to changing and neutral in my opinions. Event though I live the Mac life doesn’t mean opinions should be influenced – although not being a <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-10-25-not-being-a-fan-boy-is-hard/">fan boy is really hard</a>!</p>

<p>For the last few months I have (had) been journaling. I won’t bore you with the details but jotting down a few notes once or twice a day in the Day One app (<a href="https://gr36.com/2017-12-20-day-one-review/">my review</a>) had been helping tremendously. Bringing thoughts to the front of my mind and working through issues or decisions easier. Almost as if I were to have a conversation with myself and reach conclusions from it.</p>
<p>Trouble is, as with everything in life, as soon as you start feeling better the things that pushed you forward fade into the background. We all do it, as soon as the feelings stop we stop doing the practices that have got it through to the other side. I stopped journaling, didn’t meditate as much and I’m now kicking myself. It isn’t the first time, and won’t be the last as it happens for everything from exercise and weight loss goals to taking medication.</p>
<p>Working full time, having a side hustle, podcasting and writing is simply too much work for me to take on. You would have seen it in the lack of blog posts, heard it in the podcast and felt it with my distant tweets. However it is time to build myself again – I have spent some time working on getting my blog to look the way I want and hopefully the posts will follow suit.</p>
<p>10 days away from technology has made me more conscious of my usage, made me focus on what is important to me and actually allowed me to be more focused going forward.</p>

<p>The simple fact is, Apple like removing things. From home buttons, the MacBook Pro ports, to <a title="headphone jacks" href="https://gr36.com/2017-08-27-iphone7-headphonejack/">headphone jacks</a> — there is a relentless march towards a simple unibody design with as few cutouts as possible. It makes the design of technology sleek, appealing and arguably leaves more room for important things like battery. Although it’s only when you start using a device that cares more about usability than looking ‘sexy’ you realise this is the wrong move. I’m not saying have buttons for everything but I think it’s time for a dedicated camera button on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple place a ridiculous amount of priority on the iPhone camera. Constantly improving the quality of the shots, and plowing money into #shotoniphone advertising. Yet they don’t seem to care about getting to the camera as quickly as possible. Teaching people <a title="how to shoot the best pictures" href="https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone/photography-how-to/">how to shoot the best pictures</a> is one thing, but the easy capture of important moments is much more important to the everyday user.</p>
<p>Android phones are the leaders in launching the camera as quick as possible. Samsung did it with a double tap of the home button, Motorola has a double twist and even my BlackBerry Key2 has multiple options for friction free captures. All of which are easier than the lock screen shortcuts introduced in iOS11, or the swipe left on the home screen that has existed for years. All these actions seem to do is increase the chance of taking a picture of your pocket or turning on the torch accidentally.</p>
<p>This is without considering that a dedicated key would allow you to launch the camera regardless of what you are doing at the time. At the moment it requires multiple taps and swipes to get to the camera if you are using another app. The ability to launch the camera from every screen is a huge deal, and one that allows you to capture moments much quicker and easier.</p>
<p>Instead, Apple have removed buttons and increased complexity of the interaction with them. The power button is now the <a title="side button" href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/09/09/iphone-x-side-button/">side button</a> on the iPhone X and users must relearn to tap, double tap or hold down with other buttons dependent on what you want to achieve — whist keeping the side toggle! It seems self-evident that Android manufactures think about what is the most convenient for their users, and it is time for Apple to do the same. Give us a camera button and allow us to capture even <a title="more shot on iPhone" href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/02/25/shot-on-iphone-x-first-dance/">more shot on iPhone</a> pictures.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>This isn’t the right thing to say but I dread taking my daughters wheelchair anywhere new. Most places are great but I can’t escape the feeling of dread because it only takes one poor experience to put you off completely – thankfully London was pretty great.</p>
<h2><strong>Train To London</strong></h2>
<p>After having an awful time when traveling to Nottingham with a mobility scooter I wasn’t holding up much hope. However from arriving on the platform to getting off the other end the experience was great. We were apparently supposed to book disabled access, however this isn’t very prominent when booking tickets – because there wasn’t any space we managed to get a free upgrade to first class. Obviously this wont happen to everyone, but the staff we spoke to seemed to genuinely care about getting us the best service possible.</p>
<h2><strong>London Underground</strong></h2>
<p>Let it never be said that the underground doesn’t have good disabled access, because all things considered it does. Some stations are easier than others (we tested quite a few considering the circle line was shut) but look out for the blue disabled badges as they are strep free to street level. Also be prepared to take multiple lifts, and have to hunt around for them. We used a grand total of 21 lefts during our day in London, some better signed than others and we did plenty of pushing in between.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="tour_img-1959392-99-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ed65c81b63.jpg" alt="Tour img 1959392 99 1" width="1585" height="792" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>London Eye</strong></h2>
<p>It was from here onwards we really started to see the people that really cared about our experience. There is a stark difference between those that put in accessibility equipment for regulation and those that really care about allowing access for everyone. Staff at the London Eye went out of their way to get us through as easy as possible, they stop the wheel for everyone with issues getting on, and will place and ramp for those in a chair.</p>
<p>That’s not to say the experience went without a hiccup, getting into the cordoned off line was a nightmare, with people punching in from all angles and people clearly didn’t care about the wheelchair. This wasn’t the staffs fault, but be prepared to be a little assertive and you’ll get on great.</p>
<h2><strong>London Aquarium</strong></h2>
<p>The staff and facility here is another shining example of really caring about access to all mobility issues. There are numerous lifts to navigate the floors of the aquarium, and plentiful disabled toilets throughout the journey. There are some sticky places, particularly the ‘Amazon’ section, where the floor is made to look as if walking in the rainforest, this is a harder to push through but not impossible.</p>
<p>All of the tanks are easy to see when you’re down a little lower, but be prepared to wait at the larger tanks to get towards then front. If possible I would allow extra time and aim for quieter times in order to see everything. At hands on areas, staff were set up to transfer a star fish into a container so Lucie could have a feel sat in her chair.</p>
<p>Only once were the words “never again” muttered, when trying to work our way though the maze of lifts in Kings Cross. However all said everywhere provided great access and we had a great experience. Disabled access is experiencing a sea change at the minute and I am excited to see everywhere become easy to access for us.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As much as people try and convince me otherwise, since the iPhone 6 I just cant use my phone without a case on. The rounded corners and slippery materials leave me with too much worry that my phone will drop to the floor at any moment. I’ve tried loads of cases, from dirt cheap to surprisingly expensive – but stuck with an Apple version as it simply fit and feels the best. This isn’t <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-12-29-lopie-sea-island-review/">set in stone though</a> so when Jisoncase offered to send me their leather case for my iPhone X I jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>I opted for the saddle brown version to <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-06-21-Jisoncase-ipadpro-review/">compliment my iPad case</a>, and they both arrived in packaging that didn’t befit something so reasonably priced. Unlike the £50 Apple leather cases that supliments the £1000 you paid for the phone, the Jisoncase version is priced at just £19.95. At a price point comparative to a middle of the road silicone case, this one feels like you paid much more.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="2018-06-22-jisoncase-iPhonex-side-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/64ca66ba48.jpg" alt="2018 06 22 jisoncase iPhonex side 1" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<p>The leather is complimented by hard inlays for the volume and power buttons. It’s hard to say if this is metal or plastic but they fit very well and give a reassuring click when used. Tactile feedback is something I didn’t expect, most others in this price range often neglect the buttons. Leaving users to experience mushy button mashes that you’re not entirely sure if it worked or not.</p>
<p>The quality of leather has also been surprising high. Admittedly it doesn’t feel as soft and supple as that adorning high priced cases, but it has worn very well in the few weeks I have been using it. I do think that leather cases look much better with a little wear on them, but a quick wipe with a cloth to take these review pictures and it looks good as new again!</p>
<p>My only criticism would be the logo across the back. This could be personal preference here, but I’m not entirely happy having Jisoncase across the back of my phone. A subtle Apple it is not, more like a tramp stamp across the rear of a very expensive purchase. This is of course a minor issue given the quality of the case for a very reasonable price. The case is available in saddle brown as pictured above, but also black, blue and red. For the a fraction of the price of an Apple case, this is a bargain – grab one from <a href="http://www.jisoncase.com/iphone-x-genuine-leather-slim-case-ipx05a_p0059.html">Jisoncase website</a>, <a href="https://de.aliexpress.com/store/product/Jisoncase-Leather-Case-for-iPhone-X-Case-Cover-Genuine-Leather-Luxury-Brand-Slim-Anti-knock-Back/339855_32834930108.html?spm=a2g0x.12010612.0.0.2d973e5dvBNQLV">Aliexpress</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2usrzY5">Amazon</a></p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>For years the thoughts and rumours of iMessage on Android has been floating around. Depending on who you are listening to you get every response from “never going to happen” to “Apple need to do it”. I have often been dismissive of this ever happening, but more recently I think it could work and really should be something that Apple work on.</p>
<p>One of the arguments given is the fact that Apple already provide an Apple Music app on Android. Although this may be a left relic of Beats Music, it gives more of a reason for families to sign up for Apple Music, and even of they don’t want their kids using expensive iPhones, they can still stream music on any handset they are given. More family plans sold means more revenue for the services group and more growth to report to Wall Street.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">While this is a nice thought, the reality is that iMessage isn’t just messaging anymore. It’s a platform. Difficult to wrap my head around how they’d accomplish this at this point. <a href="https://t.co/dqkyA0SnQv">https://t.co/dqkyA0SnQv</a></p>
<p>— Zac Cichy (@zcichy) <a href="https://twitter.com/zcichy/status/1011155940257615872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
</figure>
<p>One of the huge arguments against is the fact that iMessage is often the glue that keeps people returning to iPhone when it’s time to upgrade their phone. They don’t want to leave the group chats and become a green bubble. If iMessage were provided on Android, users may be less likely the buy the new iPhone and more likely to switch to Android. Less sales of iPhones means less income for Apple.</p>
<p>Let’s take both of those arguments and consider the following. Apple provides iMessage on Android, a way for users of Android to message each other and iPhone users, end-to-end encrypted. It over night provides one of the best messaging platforms that can be used universally and freely to anyone.</p>
<p>During the last few updates to iOS, Apple have been turning iMessage into a sudo social network. A place for people to send stickers, play games, send money to each other – and in iOS12 jump into a group FaceTime call in a few taps. Apple should provide a stripped down version of iMessage on Android, a kin to the version on Mac, and let the extra features sell themselves. I believe the ability to join in with a group chat but not all of the Animoji fun and FaceTime calls would actually push more users to adopt an iPhone next time they are upgrading.</p>
<p>Android users would be included in the group chats and messages that iPhone users are, but not all the extras. Users are free to use whatever platform they choose, so don’t feel excluded but still don’t receive the full experience. How many group chats are taking place on WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger simply because not everyone uses an iPhone? Could the potential for extra sales exist if they are introduced to things like Animoji and iMessage game without the sales pitch. I believe now is the time to push forward to a universal platform and let the benefits shine through.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>esterday was a nice warm day in the UK, so I decided the tan mark from my Apple Watch could use a bit of help fading. Instead of strapping it on my wrist first thing in the morning I left it on the stand. This is the first time I I haven’t had it attached to me for a long time, and it it has highlighted a huge problem with the Activity app.</p>
<p>You see, I had my iPhone in my pocket the whole time. It recorded my 6000 steps around the farm park, yet when I open the Activity app it’s as if I’ve been asleep all day. Only when I strapped on my watch to go for a run did the activity app register that I had actually moved at all. I love my Apple Watch, I wear it constantly but I shouldn’t fell like I HAVE to have it on to register my activity.</p>
<p>I can’t understand why all the information isn’t transferred from Apple Health. If a user inputs a workout in Apple Health it appears in Activity so why not steps? Obviously there wouldn’t be any heart rate data to show, but it should be pretty easy to work out my standing time with the data gained form my iPhone, It’s pretty easy to work out that my watch is sat still and my iPhone is moving.</p>
<p>Perhaps every situation isn’t suited to having a watch on. There are no doubt many instances where people simply don’t want a watch on, but want to still record all the activity they have been doing.</p>
<p>The Activity app has ‘gamified’ my workouts and made me much more motivated to move just that little bit more. Apple could make a huge move in this direction and enable all sorts of accessories to transfer data into the service and encourage even more people to get moving. Yet Activity ONLY shows up when you pair an Apple Watch and I cant help but feel millions of users are missing out.</p>
<p>How many people would move more if their Fitbit enabled competition with anyone they knew with an iPhone not just other people with a Fitbit. All of the data is collected in Apple Health – so make every step a competition and get more people moving.</p>

<p>For as long as I have been using an iPad as my main computer I have struggled with where to keep it. I have never been a fan of many case designs as they often add a lot of weight which makes holding an iPad much more difficult. Couple this with the fact a case is pretty much redundant while in use, it’s usually in my hand or being used propped up in the Smart Keyboard, there simply hasn’t been anything to fill the void.</p>
<p>So when Apple introduced leather sleeves with the 10.5 inch iPad Pro I was interested to see if they would work – but at £130 it was far to much money to simply test one out. Thankfully as with everything made over the last few years, it has been reproduced at a much more acceptable price point – introducing the Jisoncase iPad Pro Case. All the features, but at a considerable saving and I’ve been trying one out for a couple of weeks – here is my review.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Design And Usage</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The case fits the iPad Pro and pencil snuggly inside, it is reassuringly fitted to the design and offers pretty good protection from everything other than a very high drop. It pretty much copies the official Apple design with real brown leather that is lined with soft material on the inside. Meaning not only is your iPad going to be protected, it’s going to be dusted off while inside the case and more importantly you’re going to look good carying it.</p>
<p>The cover is also available in black or red, but I opted for the brown colour to match my other brown peripherals. The leather, although not as high quality as more expensive cases, appears to be wearing very well – although a bit of wear and tear makes a leather case look much better in my opinion. So I am actually looking forward to it appearance after a few months of use. I am much more comfortable putting my iPad into my bag knowing it has more a little more protection.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-06-21-jisoncase-desk2-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/577d572c14.jpg" alt="2018 06 21 jisoncase desk2 1" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<p>I was initially very sceptical about using the case, and put off a little due to the sung fitting, but after a few days of use the case provided a great deal of protection given the amount of traveling I do. Thankfully there is also a slot to store an Apple Pencil, seeing as I have already lost two, this should hopefully make sure I know here it is and it is protected. Unfortunately it isn’t all good news because I cant use it with the Smart Keyboard.</p>
<p>Unlike other cases there is absolutely no chance of fitting an iPad in with Smart Keyboard attached. I can just about wedge it in with enough effort, but this just isn’t practical. I presume the leather will stretch over time, but when compared to simpler cases on the market I really shouldn’t have to stop using the keyboard when I want to put it in a case. I considered getting an occasional keyboard, however as great at the case is, given my <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-02-19-one-year-ipad-computer/">usage and the amount of work I do on my iPad</a> I can not justify making changes to my workflow just to use this case.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Conclusion</strong></strong></h2>
<p>I am not really sure where this now fits in, I use the Jisoncase iPad Pro Case a small amount when at home, but without storage for my keyboard the usage when traveling has stopped. If you use just the iPad and Apple Pencil (<a href="https://twitter.com/gr36/status/997016619477069826?s=21">which according to my poll</a> quite a few people do) then this is the case for you. Great quality, nice looks and protection can be found at a bargain price point.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Curbing screen time is very trendy in tech circles at the minute. There have been huge movements to <a href="https://www.tristanharris.com/">change app design</a>, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/change-your-screen-to-grayscale-to-combat-phone-addicti-1795821843">turn it black and white</a> and even calls for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/08/apple-investors-iphone-addiction-children">manufactures to step in</a> and stop people using them so much. So it was no surprise when Apple took to the stage, only a few weeks after Google i/o and launched pretty much the same thing. ScreenTime is a quintessential Apple response to outside pressure, a way to highlight the latest Silicon Valley worry – but it is hugely important people pay attention.</p>
<p>Taking its design inspiration from Apple Health, ScreenTime is built right into the setting of every iPhone that will run iOS12 (and that’s most of them). Displaying graphical data about app usage, notification tallies and even how many times you pick the device up – you could be forgiven for thinking it was a step too far. However Apple have found a very safe ground where there is no scolding no matter how much you use your device. No set amount for how you use the apps that are installed, simply well presented data that will hopefully make some users think about the things it shows.</p>
<p>No one thinks it is Apples (or manufactures) place to tell you how you should use a device, but I am so happy that at last there is coherent data people can see. If this sparks a change in usage, they can be guided to a healthier way of life. For far too long I have overheard awkward conversations from average people trying to explain to others just how much they are using their phone. Finally the place exists to show them, a place to send them to look into where they are spending their time and leave the decisions up to them.</p>
<p>Time is a metric you never get back. Time is something we all know we need to make the most of, return the most value from it. I’m not advocating that every one works harder, or that everyone starts jumping from planes or becoming hedonists – but value is a very personal thing and users can now make the decision themselves. If they take away great value from engaging on Twitter for 4 hours a day – brilliant, that is great to hear. If they take great pride from being the person that everyone communicates with so recieve 500 iMessages a day – again perfect. Yet at its very core ScreenTime provides an almost real time view of how much of it is spent on a device and offers a few tools to help, should you decide to cut down.</p>
<p>Along with improvements to Do Not Disturb and notification handling Apple are moving into a very unique place. They make a serious amount of money from selling you the device, but also from the apps you purchase from the store. They do not profit from your personal data nor the level of engagement you have with a device. Google however – Do.</p>

     <p>It’s become a bit of a running joke amongst my tech friends. A personal meme that I keep repeating the same sort of phase when questioned about a whole range of topics. Anything from GDPR to Social Media harassment my answer – [micro.blog}().</p>
<p>Many people don’t understand. I’ve tried and failed to explain why micro.blog matters in a world of Twitter, Facebook and countless blogging platforms. A few have converted and love it, and a few have tried and given up (and <a href="https://darylbaxter.micro.blog/">given me some stick</a>. My biggest take away from all the jokes is that the platform is not for everyone and that’s ok.</p>
<p>This post started off as a bit of a joke, but there is a sensible point in here somewhere. We all preach about things that we love, hell most of Twitter is people doing exactly that. It may be the latest bit of technology you’ve bought and think everyone should have one. It might be your choice of religion and you want to express all of the benefits it will give you in this life and the next. Or it might just be a new(ish) publishing platform that gets you <a href="/2018/05/25/intentional-twitter-usage.html">away from social media</a> a little and gives you a place to publish the writing that doesn’t quite make it to your blog.</p>
<p>Remember when I thought Medium was the best thing since sliced bread, that lasted quite a while and look how that ended up! You are all just going to have to weather the storm until I find something else to get obsessed with. I’m sure there is a start up out there planning to “make a difference to the world” and they should be along shortly.</p>

<p>There are several narratives that exist through my blog posts. Productivity <a href="https://gr36.com/apps">apps</a>, <a href="https://gr36.com/workflows">Workflows</a> and me trying to quit social media. The latest news in accordance with the latter, is trying to use Twitter more intentionally and it’s working very well.</p>
<p>We’ve all been there. Standing and a queue, waiting for something, or just generally any moment where or lives aren’t rushing along – the first reaction is to pull the phone out and start scrolling through an app. Mine is <a href="https://twitter.com/gr36">Twitter</a>, I’ve been around there for years and there is usually something interesting going on to take my attention for a few minutes. Unfortunately the level of stress involved and the amount of negativity is really starting to get to not just me <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40545727/i-unfortunately-have-the-equivalent-of-5-phds-in-twitter-harassment">but many users</a>.</p>
<p>Quitting Twitter completely is just <strong>not</strong> an option for me (<a href="https://gr36.com/2018-01-20-building-a-micro-blog-on-jekyll/">I’ve tried</a>), I do get a lot of benefit from Twitter – I’ve met loads of really interesting people and started my <a href="https://www.byodpodcast.com/">Podcast</a> because of it. So the answer is to limit my exposure to things that affect me negatively. The perfect solution will not only cut down my usage of Twitter but alos stop this always present urge to pull out my phone at any moment of boredom.</p>
<p>Turning my notifications off mediated this somewhat, I am no longer poked to go back to Twitter by dings. I have never really viewed those notifications as important that need instant attention. The answer has been simply removing the app from my phone, I have drastically reduced my exposure to Twitter, and I really do feel better for it.</p>
<p>My Twitter usage is now restricted to when I want to ‘go and check’ Twitter on my computer. The downside is that I don’t reply to messages and mentions like I used to, and also my tweets will come in short bursts of quite a few in a short space of time. So I must apologise for the time line spam, however I will still continue to share things to Twitter using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/linky-for-twitter-and-facebook/id438090426?at=1000ltj4">Linky</a>, and posts to micro.blog will appear there also. I am not gone, just using Twitter far more intentionally and it has worked wonders.</p>

<p>Despite <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?at=1000ltj4">Drafts</a> being around for ages, I am very new to using it for any length of time. I’ve already posted about my <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-04-29-finding-use-for-drafts/">love of the app after giving it a chance</a>, so I won’t go into that here but thought I’d share some of my most used and favourite actions.</p>
<h2>Send to Things</h2>
<p>I really don’t need to discuss my love of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?at=1000ltj4">Things</a> here again, do I? This action enables me to write multiple todos and pass them all to Things at once. Saves loads of time for planning a project or if you take meeting action notes like I do.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Cc">Install</a></p>
<h2>Post to Micro.blog</h2>
<p>The greatest thing about Drafts is the fact I start absolutely every bit of text in the app and then pass it to its destination. I start all writing here and if it is long enough or good enough I post to my blog, if not I use this action to post to micro.blog with ease.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Hg">Install</a></p>
<h2>Send To Bear</h2>
<p>My longer notes or <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-05-15-workflow-things-attachments-using-bear/">lengthy attachments to Things</a> todo items are stored in <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-01-19-bear-app-review/">Bear</a>. This action does exactly what it says, passes all text to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bear/id1016366447?at=1000ltj4">Bear</a> and creates a new note.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CZ">Install</a></p>
<h2>Post To My Blog</h2>
<p>Should the text I’m writing be deemed worthy I post it to my blog hosted on github using Jekyll. In order to do this it needs to have the correct front matter and then be pushed to github using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/working-copy/id896694807?at=1000ltj4">Working Copy</a>. This action does all of that in one tap. I have several of these for posting to different parts of my blog.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1GO">Install</a></p>
<h2>Covert To HTML</h2>
<p>I quite often write columns for <a href="http://eepurl.com/dvApEj">newsletters</a> or websites that require me to send it across in HTML. Or perhaps I just want to see what the page I’m building is going to look like. Whatever the reason this action turns markdown into HTML.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Eb">Install</a></p>
<h2>Do More..</h2>
<p>There are hundreds more that I could mention but these are my most used ones. Matt Birchler has also <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/draft-5-actions-the-birchtree-collection/">created some really good ones himself</a> and helped out with the post to micro.blog action above. Drafts has become my favourite app and does most of what I used workflow for. I’d love to know your favourite.</p>

<p>I’ve made no secret that I have been crying out for the ability to add attachment to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?at=1000ltj4">Things 3</a>. I love the app but this is the only thing that is keeping me using <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-01-14-todoist-review/">Todoist</a>for work related reminders. I have tried loads of different options and work arounds, been <a href="https://twitter.com/syrinxstarman/status/995692751277645824?s=21">helped out along the way</a>, but could never find something good enough. This isn’t perfect but the best way is to use Bear to add files as attachments to Things.</p>
<p>Bear has a great implementation of file attachments to notes, you can clip pretty much anything you wish. The app will then show file links inline, allowing for other notes and attachments to be placed as desired. Thanks to the developers love of URL schemes you can then link to the note from Things. You can do all this manually but you came here for the Workflow!</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-05-15-workflow-things-attachments-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/69664ce76b.jpg" alt="2018 05 15 workflow things attachments 1" width="1000" height="498" border="0" /><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/2b23f20166734c06be30b71bb80f0d6f">Download the Workflow</a></p>
<p>This can be run from the today widget, provides the file picker, and once you’ve decided on your attachment it gets to work. The file name will be used for a note in Bear, and of course an item in Things with a link back to the note.</p>
<p>Despite the need for a work around it actually allows you to clip a few attachments and also make notes alongside for a pretty great experience. I have my fingers crossed for Cultured Code to add in attachments, but they seem adverse to adopting the feature.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>After <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-04-29-finding-use-for-drafts/">giving it some time</a> I am very happy with doing all my blog writing in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?at=1000ltj4">Drafts 5</a>. Unfortunately due to Workflow’s slowing updates, actions take ages to update and I have been stuck on a way to update my old <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-03-13-workflow-bear-and-things-ideas/">Bear for ideas Workflow</a>. Luckily using Drafts actions and the robust URL scheme I’ve been able to get this going again.</p>
<p>For this Workflow to work you will also need this <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Ib">Drafts 5 action</a>. The Workflow uses the url scheme to create a note using your chosen idea title and notes, and also run the above action. This copies the open note URL and the notes UUID to the clipboard, ready to be placed in a Things to-do item.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bb3ebafb36.jpg" alt="2018 05 15 drafts things idea 1" title="2018-05-15-drafts-things-idea-1.png" border="0" width="1000" height="498" /><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/22d2e29e5ddd46a9b1d04d723574a089">Download The Workflow</a></p>
<p>The Workflow will then create a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?at=1000ltj4">Things</a> item with the ideas title, and copy in a link to open the Drafts note with a single tap. Last but not least you will be returned to your Drafts 5 note ready to tap away if you wish.</p>
<p>As with every Workflow, you can customise this to your liking. If you don’t want to be returned to Drafts, simply deleted the last open URL action from the Workflow. I have also left out an reminder or due date on the Things item, although I like to add in a reminder for later that day just to give me a gentle push towards fleshing it out a little.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://gr36.com/workflows">some of my other Workflows</a> I have shared over time, these are steadily increasing as I find and make more.

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As I slowly split my life into different sections, and live a life with different apps for home and work – <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Things 3</a> has become vitally important. It takes a more relaxed approach than <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-01-14-todoist-review/">Todoist</a> and allows me to remember things to do but not feel stressed about them.</p>
<p>So I’ve put together a simple <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Workflow</a> to place a list of items I need into a checklist in Things 3. This can be launched from the Today widget so you can type in all the items, just tap return between them. Or more often than not my wife will text me a list or put it in a shared Apple Note, I can simply highlight the list and share it to the Workflow.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/07e225d2ec.jpg" alt="2018 05 15 shoppinglist workflow 1" title="2018-05-15-shoppinglist-workflow-1.png" border="0" width="1000" height="665" /><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/24351a82ce444f318812c0b134f73480">Download the Workflow</a></p>
<p>After typing in which shop you’re going to the Workflow creates a checklist in Things to mark off once you’re there. Such is the power of Workflow and also the brilliant automation features of Things this simple base can also be easily adapted for a list of whatever you need to do, such as a project checklist or DIY tasks list.</p>
<p>All you need to do is change the question in the ask for input action where it says “where are you going” to a more relevant question for the list you wish to make.</p>

     <p>Believe it or not it was Google I/O keynote yesterday! I completely missed this until the event was on, not sure if it is publicised less or I take less of an interest now. Even so Google put all of their eggs in the AI basket and also demonstrated loads of updates to Android. Throw in a few self driving cars for good measure, but most controversially Google Assistant voice capabilities.</p><p>The demo of <a href="https://thenextweb.com/google/2018/05/10/googles-duplex-voice-bot-is-clever-but-im-probably-never-going-to-use-it/">Google Duplex</a> lead to initial amazement, lots of worry about AI and then the inevitable backlash. Most notability of which on this weeks <a href="http://pca.st/episode/e0480447-a19f-4a4d-90dd-0d275432cbdb">Connected podcast</a> the technology was completely ripped apart. Not just a little bit, but completely dismissed as not needed and pointless. The service is indeed initially very creepy but this is indicative of a lot of tech commentators – they completely miss the accessibility angle.</p><p>It shouldn’t even really be referred to as an angle, accessibility should be front and centre of everything. I don’t expect every person to understand what technology such as this can do to people with a disability, but people need to start considering others. It doesn’t take a genius to realise that a service such as this could revolutionise the lives of those with communication issues. Not simply for those that are mute, but a whole range of speech impediments completely remove the possibility to use the telephone. Yet Google are working on the ability for voice communication to be done entirely autonomously – current systems are very expensive, clunky to use or rely on preprogrammed responses.</p><p>I do agree that perhaps the person on the other end should be informed, but if Google know everything about you they might be able to make a pretty good replacement anyway!</p>

     <p>It has been a while since I have been genuinely excited to dive into a new app. After my initial trepidation, and following the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/">massive buzz</a> around the 5th instalment of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Drafts app</a>, I <a href="/2018/04/21/drafts-updatei-must.html">decided to give it a chance</a> and I am so glad I did.</p><p>I have tried Drafts 4 a few times when interesting things come up, these things more often than not involve <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">Viticci</a> et al discussing it’s merits. Yet for some reason I just never really ‘got it’ – it is a powerful enough app but I couldn’t find a use case for it when compared to <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-08-02-bear-and-ulysses/">Ulysses</a> or <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-01-19-bear-app-review/">Bear</a>. After only a few hours of really using the app, and intensifying after a few days, I went though a transition that has affected my relationship with writing text altogether.</p><p>By using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Drafts</a> I no longer need to decide where the text I wish to write needs to go. Drafts has become a place for notes, reminders, blog posts and everything in between. All powered by the single biggest selling point of this app – Actions.</p><p>By building up an arsenal of actions I can now place any text I need to type down where I need it to go. Whereas previously before typing any text in I had to decide if it was a note, blog post, tweet – whatever it was – I had to spend brain power deciding where to put it. Things I need to remember when talking to someone, blog post ideas, long emails I’m mulling over, absolutely everything goes into drafts to be distributed later on.</p><p>The <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/">actions directory</a> has provided me with a whole range of abilities, or inspiration to write my own, integrating with a huge range of services. I have an action to <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1EN">create a Todoist item</a>, post to <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Dj">micro blog</a>, place the <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1GO">front matter into my post and save to my github</a>, and loads more. If I start a blog post now and it doesn’t quite make the mark I can post it to microblog instead. Or a short link post might turn into a full on post, I don’t need different apps doing different things any longer.</p><p>Drafts has enabled me to publish much more just by simplifying my workflow. Add this to the brilliant markdown keyboard functions, fast and fluid app and much better design, I am so happy I gave Drafts a chance. Grab it <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">from the app store</a> and find a use case for it, it might just change your outlook.</p>

<p>Every so often we have a paying for apps debate, sparked off by a popular app releasing an update or <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-09-04-ulysses-subscritpions/">changing income model</a> – and here we are again. Drafts 5 <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/">launches to quite a bit of fun fair from reviewers</a> and also some backlash from users. Time and time again you hear “I won’t pay for app subscriptions”.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Its a terrible business model, that I don’t agree with”</p></blockquote>
<p>Since Apple expanded the subscription model, quite a few apps have adopted the option of charging a small monthly fee or yearly price. Usually giving users the option of a free tier and only paying for more advanced features. These usually come in the form of syncing or hosting, in the case of Drafts it is pro features such as themes and <a href="http://getdrafts.com/actions/">actions</a>. It doesn’t matter what features you get for the price it never quite satisfies the resistance.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> surprising is more often that not when questioned, the retort is one with quite a few logical holes. Quite a common one is the fact users would rather pay for a version upgrade. Which is a pretty easy fix, simply change the way you think about the subscriptions.</p>
<p>Think of the yearly price as purchasing this version with free upgrades. If it gets to the end of that period, either pay again or choose something else. Subscriptions aren’t for every user, nor every app on your phone. No one wants to pay micro payments for every app, but the ones that really aid your life deserve funding. What’s the alternative, poor quality free apps? Adverts that harvest user data and break up design or usage?</p>
<p>By paying money towards an app you aid development greatly you create a constant stream of funding to pay for regular updates and improvements. So in the long run you generally get many more updates than the usual single pay to use apps. It’s a win win situation – just change the way you view them.</p>

<p>There appears to be some confusion around what copying is. Couple this with the argument breaking down into an inevitable Android vs iOS debate and Twitter has been exceptionally noisy today.</p>
<p>Gruber, although a little confused, got the final thoughts in his reply to an <a title="earlier blog post" href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/04/on_normalizing_ripoffs">earlier blog post</a> spot on with:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you write an article, and then I write my own article about the same topic, that just means you were first. But if I copy your article and just change a few words, that’s plagiarism. There’s a big difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is a little late to these comments as I’ve already <a title="shared many of my thoughts" href="https://gr36.com/2018-04-02-copying-the-notch/">shared many of my thoughts</a> but there is no denying the trend is getting worse. Unfortunately there is a lot of fanboy going on in both this and other <a title="surrounding posts" href="https://www.imore.com/where-samsung-shaped-dent-universe?amp#click=https://t.co/fcbbrKarTd">surrounding posts</a> meaning some people are going to switch off very early. As with many things in the Apple verse you have to cut through all this to see the points made about design copying.</p>
<p>There is a massive difference between implementing a feature that another company launched first into your product, or straight up copying it. There exists a theoretical spectrum of ‘inspiration’ — ranging from <a title="Huawei copying software and hardware" href="https://gr36.com/2018-04-02-copying-the-notch/">Huawei copying software</a> and hardware almost pixel for pixel, and <a title="Android taking inspiration from iOS" href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3268870/android/android-p-iphone-x-imitation-innovation.html">Android taking inspiration from iOS</a>. Undoubtedly there is a completely different response to designing features inspired by others, and simply wedging them in.</p>
<p>Only a consumer can decide where they are comfortable sitting on the spectrum and no amount of tech blog commentary will change that. Chinese manufacturers have been doing this for years and customers are still voting with their wallets.</p>
<p>With that said, you cannot point fingers at others and deny Apple doesn’t do similar things. It may not be as blatant as Chinese OEM rips offs, but there is no denying features like the notification centre didn’t require much courage to design. Samsung seems to have changed their previous ways and are now launching industry leading product design, but even they have the occasional slip back into old ways. Companies are all the same so enough with the denial.</p>
<p>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but copying should be offensive to the consumer.</p>

<p>Right from the off the Apple Watch got a tremendous amount of negative reaction. Reviewers said it was under powered, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review">looked strange</a> and the OS felt like a confusing mess. Some had valid points about watchOS, and ever since Apple have been stripping away parts to make it more cohesive. Yet the hate for the ‘honeycomb’ layout app grid remains – but I like it.</p>
<p>There is no denying that the original watchOS was confused and full of half baked ideas. However as time has progressed Apple have zoned in on notifications and health as the selling points. Working hard to streamline the OS and make apps load faster. In watchOS4 Apple allowed users to switch to an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/07/how-to-switch-between-list-view-and-honeycomb-app-grid-on-apple-watch-with-watchos-4/">alphabetic list of apps instead</a>, which many uses immediately did. However in my honest opinion this layout takes much longer the get to the apps you need.</p>
<p>The honeycomb allows you to quickly find the app you need and tap straight on it. All the icons are familiar because they are the same ones we stare at each day using our phone. By presenting them on one screen the speed of selecting an app is much quicker than scrolling a long list of apps in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Perhaps the much larger issue is the fact that many of the stock app icons are too similar and easily confused. The timer and stopwatch ones are strikingly similar but still immediately obvious which app is which. With a little work on customising the layout you can have something familiar, easy to access and useful immediately accessible by just pressing the crown.</p>
<p>Couple this with finally app makers realising that not <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17191408/instagram-apple-watch-app-dead">every platform needs an accompanying watchOS app</a>, and the future looks extremely bright (and light) for Apples most personal device. Embrace the honeycomb, don’t scroll through lists to find the app you need, because scrolling down to Workouts is a chore in itself.</p>

<p>Over the past few years I have been writing on and off for several websites. Some small, some slightly bigger, never successfully but I enjoyed it all the same. I flirted with writing if you will. During this time I never really cared about my words, I never really gave a second thought to what happens to them in a few years, but I have noticed a trend of taking others words and putting someone else’s name on them.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the websites I have posted to have closed down now. Unmaintainable in an externally crowded internet and squeezed monetisation options. Some are just relics, still active but no longer updated. Some of the larger ones are still going strong and doing amazing work which is great to see. A few however have taken all of the words I have written and attached some else’s name to them.</p>
<p>This isn’t an ego rubbing post, I try to keep that in check nowadays. I just don’t understand the ethics behind it. When did this become the norm? I don’t care about the words. Delete them for all that it matters, but don’t pretend someone else wrote them instead. It’s unethical to say the least, doubly so if you have the audacity to show adverts against them.</p>
<p>I go backwards and forwards on whether this actually matters or not, and in the grand scheme of things it doesn’t. It is a modern day, internet publishing side effect. Something that it seems is to be expected from time to time, the price to pay for handing over work to others. This is ultimately why I moved to blogging for myself and away from platforms such as Medium.</p>
<p>Writing for other websites has its advantages. There is a editor there to pick up my typos and lambast my poor grammar. Yet also someone there making decisions that determine what happens to your words. With me just left to wonder where my name has gone, and why.</p>

<p>There are so many things I don’t understand about technology companies, and even more I don’t understand about users. We are almost predisposed to pick a side and sick with them to the bitter end (<a title="not being a fan boy is hard" href="https://gr36.com/2017-10-25-not-being-a-fan-boy-is-hard/">not being a fan boy is hard</a>). Yet the companies we stick by make the strangest of decisions for us, locking down customisations, installing default apps or even ripping off brands users claim to hate.</p>
<p>Brands copying Apple has been the norm for as long as I can remember. It felt like every Windows Laptop for years looked like the MacBook Air, every Samsung phone looked like the iPhone 3g(s) and even now manufactures put in a needless notch after criticising Apple design.</p>
<p>When using Android I defended the OEM for being able to do as they please, and it must be what users want. Huawei <a href="https://gr36.com/2016-06-21-huaweip9-review/">made their version of Android</a> as close to iOS as they could, Xiaomi did even worse and everyone carried on regardless. This in itself isn’t a massive deal, but I cant shake the feeling that blatantly ripping off other companies design must feel a little insulting as a user.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, Huawei is copying Apple; but I’m not a patent lawyer, I just want to see good tech proliferate — Vlad Savov, The Verge</p></blockquote>
<p>I completely understand where reviewers like Vlad are coming from, good technology should spread through the whole industry so everyone can use it. It doesn’t have to be a carbon copy of the originator though surely. Why must they do it so blatantly, is it to dupe users into thinking they have the ‘real’ version? For users to trick other into thinking they have spent more money than they have? I cant think of a single reason outside of brand culture that explains why everything looks almost the same.</p>
<p>This isn’t even a design issue, its purely an aesthetic issue. Brands such as Huawei are more than capable of distinguishing themselves, phones such as the Honor 9 are brilliantly designed. Users should demand more from companies and not blatant copies of other products.</p>

<p>As I work on producing more and more podcast audio headphones are becoming one of the most important things in my tech arsenal. My trusty wood backed over ear wired headphones that I have been using since EuroTech Talk (I have no idea what they are they came free with a subscription to wired) are no longer cutting it.</p>
<p>My requirements are as much noise cancelling as possible, a wired connection for the times I’m using a mixer, and most importantly they must be over ear. I’ve used some <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beats-Dr-Dre-Wireless-Headphones-Black/dp/B01LW0M4J1/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521882178&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=solo+3&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=a876c4c968415aac9658e0cce98feb52">Beats Solo3</a> for a while and due to being on ear they are uncomfortable after an hour or so of use.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of models that fit into this category, with price tags anywhere from just over £100 to north of £500. Almost all of these, there are considered to be 3-4 leaders, and hundreds of reviews comparing them all together. Most people give the nod to the Sony WH-1000X closely followed by the stalwart of any long haul flight the Bose QC.</p>
<p>Yet as much as I know that the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-WH-1000XM2-Cancelling-Resolution-Recognition-Black/dp/B074ZRG5MN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521881813&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sony+1000xm2&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=1d3870b83c3e3f092a00db5a8ea802a9">Sony WH-1000XM2</a>, or equally the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B01E3SNO1G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521881787&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=BOse+QC35&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=7c0d32d221b6eb1d208501606080b5fd">Bose QuietComfort 35</a> or the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sennheiser-PXC-550-Wireless-Cancelling-Black/dp/B01E3XLNA0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521881730&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Sennheiser+PXC+550&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=e4cc1101fde208a3a4a5290d7e15b438">Sennheiser PXC 550</a> are the much better choice for sound. Any headphones produced with the W chip in must become a consideration – so I must also take into account the Beats Studio 3 simply because they are so easy to use.</p>
<p>Many times I have used my AirPods to walk down the gym, and switched to my <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beats-Dr-Dre-BeatsX-Earphones-Black/dp/B01LW9IKX7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521884335&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=beats+x&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=265528e898c78c9ed48651da32c1d568">Beats X</a> or Solo3 for working out without missing a single beat. Many people dismiss the Beats headphones as sounding overly bass heavy, but more modern versions are better, and I can forgive this if I don’t have to fiddle with the Bluetooth connection screen for 5 minutes before each use.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B01E3SNO1G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521881787&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=BOse+QC35&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=7c0d32d221b6eb1d208501606080b5fd">Bose QC35ii</a> even have a ‘Google Assistant button’ which is pretty much useless when using an iPhone. This is no fault of Google assistant, or Bose, but Apple Music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YKe2nndGUc">music controls are extremely limited</a>. The smartphone wars are now extending towards headphone manufactures and car companies, what a time to be alive.</p>
<p>Ultimately I wanted something comfortable and ’neutral’ sounding so I went with the Bose (my personal preference), but it just shows what a difference the W chips have made. If they were not installed in the Beats range they wouldn’t even be in the conversation.</p>

<p>This is becoming a bit of a regular occurrence, I’m on a roll creating Workflows to make my writing easier. This latest one uses my new todo app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Things</a> and my favourite notes app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bear/id1016366447?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Bear</a> to make sure I catch all the ideas I have for blog posts.</p>
<p>Thats not to say it can’t be used for other things, reminders that you need to add a lot of text in. An idea you need to expand on later, whatever it is this Workflow will make sure you don’t forget about it.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-03-13-workflow-idea-screenshots-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7a48e306fb.jpg" alt="2018 03 13 workflow idea screenshots 1" width="1000" height="665" border="0" /><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/eba6f5949e9e443c8aa4a5e843fe39e2">Download the Workflow.</a></p>
<p>Once you’ve <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/eba6f5949e9e443c8aa4a5e843fe39e2">downloaded the Workflow</a> obviously you will need Bear Notes app. If you’re unsure on what it is and if it’s worthwhile <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-01-19-bear-app-review/">check out my review first.</a> Unless you want to sync between devices or export in PDF the app is completely free. Don’t forget to grant access to Bear in Workflow before you try and run it!</p>
<p>The Workflow will ask you for a title for your idea, and then for any extra notes you want to add. Once these are added it will create a new Bear note with your idea title and notes, then create a new Things todo with the same title. In the Things item there will be a link to the Bear note and also a reminder set for this evening.</p>
<p>You can of course remove the reminder but I find it really handy to set one for later on so I can flesh out the idea further and most importantly I don’t forget about it!</p>
<p>The Workflow takes full advantage of the new automation and URL scheme added into the 3.4 update. For extra customisation you can edit the URL at the bottom with all sorts of extras. For hints and tips how to do this check out the link builder on the <a href="https://support.culturedcode.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2803573">Things support page</a>.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Wow, well this adventure into the possibility of using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Things</a> as a replacement for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/todoist-organize-your-life/id572688855?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Todoist</a> is proving fruitful. That is not to say I couldn’t do most of these things in other apps, but the automation seems much more approachable. It also helps that people like Federico at MacStories keep giving me inspiration for more Workflows.  <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/8a204d55398b44a1b7df854b746227c6">This Workflow</a> simplifies one shared with <a href="https://club.macstories.net/">MacStories members</a>, and allows me to quickly add webpages that I want to read later, or ones I want to write about to Things.</p>
<p>It takes Safari webpage links, finds the article title and webpage, prompts for a tag and due date, then puts all of that information into Things for you to look at later. The date can also be input in natural language as <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-03-03-natural-language-dates-in-things/">discussed in an older post</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a1f2bca0b1.jpg" alt="2018 03 04 things article screens 1" title="2018-03-04-things-article-screens-1.png" border="0" width="1000" height="498" />All of the information is then crammed into a URL which might look complicated but is in fact surprisingly easy. Due to the automation features packed into Things 3.4 the URL will open in the Things app and add in your desired todo item. Including article title, website information and of course the URL as a note, so you can pick up where you left off.</p>
<p>This simple Workflow is really easy to customise if you wish. I use one without a due date which can be deleted if you want to. You can also create a list in Things for all of these articles instead of adding a tag. Just change the long URL at the bottom to read <code>&amp;list=</code> instead of <code>&amp;tags=</code>.</p>
<p>There is a whole list of possibilities that you could build into the URL scheme if you want to take a look what Things supports head over to their support page. I will be sharing more <a href="https://gr36.com/workflow">Workflows as and when I build them</a> so follow along.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As you might have <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-02-26-workflow-spark-email-to-things/">gathered already</a> I have been playing around with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Things 3 from Cultured Code</a>. After being a long time <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/todoist-organize-your-life/id572688855?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Todoist</a> user it has taken a little getting used to, but the recent updates have made the app provide almost everything that I am looking for. One major missing piece is natural language processing, and once you have started using things in this way it is hard to go back.</p>
<p>In Todoist you can input tasks by typing as if you were speaking. For example typing into the entry field “Change the air filter next Tuesday at 8am” will add in a task of exactly that instruction. Where as in Things you have to tap through date and time options for a reminder at the desired time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3dd8337253.jpg" alt="2018 03 03 things screenshots 1" title="2018-03-03-things-screenshots-1.png" border="0" width="1000" height="665" />Luckily there is a simple solution, and once again <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Workflow</a> comes to the rescue. If you haven’t used Workflow before, grab the app (its free) and check out a <a href="https://gr36.com/2016-06-27-get-started-workflow/">few hints to get you started</a>.</p>
<p>Workflow has an in built natural language engine so can do all the heavy lifting for you. I have put together a very <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/a7514852104a48498aafe5624b0e468d">simple workflow</a> that will help you along. Grab it from the link above and put it to use, it’s as easy as pie.</p>
<p>The first prompt will ask you for a title for your todo, the second will ask for any notes you wish to ask. Lastly there is a prompt for the date for the reminder. This can process regular dates and also the natural language you desire, convert this into the format Things needs and put it all into the app.</p>
<p>You can customise this as much as you like with tags and projects. For more information on Things URL scheme and automation head over to <a href="https://support.culturedcode.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2803573">their support page</a>.</p>

  </div>
  </div>
<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I am now a little over 3 years with the iPad as my computer and nothing much has really changed. I wrote about one year of using the <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-02-19-one-year-ipad-computer/">iPad Pro as my computer</a> last year but I started with an iPad Air 2 in 2015. Don’t get me wrong, the power of the iPad has improved, the level of apps has taken a huge leap forward and even the OS is easier to use – but in reality things are pretty much as they were.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of articles proposing inprovements that Apple need to make to improve the iPad. Federico Viticci is one of my inspirations for using the iPad and he is no stranger to mocking up <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-11-ipad-wishes-and-concept-video/">videos and making a wish list for iPad</a> improvements. Yet I find myself in a pretty happy place for my usage, writing and being productive is a breeze on iOS. Most of the improvements requested are for small use cases and perhaps this is the point where the changes plateau or Apple chooses to make <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-12-home-screen-changes-pushed-to-2019.2103616/">drastic changes to the UI</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>as great as iOS10 is there are still holes in Apples OS. Thankfully most of these are filled by the rich app ecosystem</p></blockquote>
<p>With the release of iOS11 Apple made an initially confusing but revolutionary change to multi tasking, resulting in much easier interaction. The “holes” that were in iOS10 have mostly been filled by either Apple or applications – and in this third party echo system the real strides are being made. Professional applications are arriving in the iPad all the time, amazingly capable applications such as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/affinity-photo/id1117941080?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Affinity Photo</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/working-copy/id896694807?mt=8&amp;at=100ltj4">Working Copy</a>prove the real strength of the platform.</p>
<p>If rumours are to be believed development looks set to become easier with the introduction of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/12/apple-has-a-plan-for-universal-apps-across-ios-and-macos-report-says/">shared development platform with project Marzipan</a>. This could, as many have pointed out, lead to macOS being inundated with Instagram and Facebook. Yet could just as well lead to powerful Mac apps appearing on iPad. Unfortunately there are downsides, and you can be assured that Adobe won’t conform to a sandbox environment.</p>
<h2>Accessories Made For A Pro</h2>
<p>Adoption of the iPad as a computer is due to many reasons – but they revolve around the powerful hardware, amazing battery life and the ecosystems surrounding it. Despite Apple producing a Pencil and a Smart Keyboard, the innovation has stalled. There are very few accessories that make use of the smart connector featured on the iPad Pro, and third party alternatives are often severely <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&amp;hl=en-gb&amp;ei=Xq6KWofNHIS9gAbQiLG4Dg&amp;q=brydge+keyboard+issues&amp;oq=brydge+keyboard+issues&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-serp.3..0.16214.17708.0.17816.9.9.0.4.4.0.152.869.1j6.7.0....0...1c..64.mobile-gws-serp..2.7.525...0i67k1.152.zSrde3Yxc_U">lacking in quality</a>.</p>
<p>In order to push the iPad Pro into other areas, would further development of accessories be required? The hardware is hugely powerful, yet restricted to typing on a keyboard or writing on the screen. Many people have mused about an iOS laptop – this would be pretty easy to achieve with an open ecosystem. Could Apple allow companies to build a dock for iPad usage on a bigger screen? Could Apple allow interaction with a mouse?</p>
<p>They certainly could do lots of things, but would this provide many more sales of devices? The real progress is to be made in applications, not changing the interaction paradigm completely. When Apple featured the phrase “what’s a computer” in <a href="https://youtu.be/sQB2NjhJHvY">their advert</a> they really meant it. There are so many people now using mobile first devices that the traditional computing interface is becoming less and less relevant. There are still things that are far easier to use a keyboard and mouse for, but these things are decreasing all the time.</p>
<p>Leaning the iPad back to a desktop computing model serves no purpose other than complicating matters. The iPad in 2018 should continue down the path it already sets out, the future of computing is coming into sight in a mobile device world. I am amazingly happy with everything the iPad can do for me – long may it continue.</p>

<p>The HomePod itself it deceptively small, but surprisingly heavy. It comes boxed in the usual Apple style – paying particular attention to the experience of sliding off the top and uncovering the HomePod it all its glory. Bar the device itself there is little else in the box apart from a small information card and a single Apple logo sticker.</p>
<p>Particular attention has been paid towards the power cable. The braided cord fitted to the HomePod is not detachable, some seem to think this is user hostile, however you are not likely to be unplugging the unit very often. Should damage occur to the cable, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/10/16999372/apple-homepod-repair-damaged-cable-pricing">repair will cost you $29</a>. Which is reasonable given that dropping the HomePod itself could <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/9/16994974/homepod-repair-price-applecare-warranty">prove very costly</a>.</p>

<p>Many people have raved about how easy the set up is for HomePod, as it expands on the same process as with any W1 powered device. Simply power the unit on, and nearby devices will be prompted with a set up card at the bottom of the screen. You <em>will</em> need an iOS device running iOS11 to do this, be it an iPhone or iPad, but did you really expect anything else.</p>
<p>My set up was slightly more complicated, at first try I was greeted with the blank card that has plagued many users. The cause of this hasn’t been established, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArP9SOz9CUI&amp;feature=youtu.be">although seems to be linked to the iPhone X</a>, but I was able to complete on the second attempt by simply powering off the HomePod and back on again.</p>
<p>Pay special attention to these set up screens, because if like me you are using the device for the family. Enabling private information will mean anybody can instruct the HomePod to read out messages and even reply to them. This is pretty transparent in the set up process, but sometime excitement takes over and you simply accept any prompts given you.</p>
<h2>Sound</h2>
<p>The HomePod is first and foremost a speaker, Apple clearly wanted to produce a great sounding device to consume music on. They have been on and off developing the device for a number of years, and the results speak for themselves. I am by no means an audio guru, but the HomePod sounds great wherever you are in the room, and when compared to the many Sonos speakers I have it is noticeably better.</p>
<p>That is not to say that is head a shoulders above everything else. Podcasts and audio books do not sound as good as they do on other devices, but for Music the sound is much more powerful and richer than many other devices. I have noticed sounds in songs that I have listened to lots of times purely from the HomePod audio range. The Verge did a great comparison video on a range of devices and mirrors pretty much my own findings.</p>
<h2>Siri</h2>
<p>Apples ‘smart’ assistant gets a lot of stick, and rightly so. It is considered well behind both Google and Amazon in terms of ability and also parsing information. You will find no arguments here, Apple have a serious issue with being left behind and the HomePod does not help their argument.</p>
<p>If anything it is further evidence of the lack of development that the very first voice assistant has had since being released alongside the iPhone 4s. With that said I have not had any trouble with Siri hearing my commands, even above loud music, and they have pretty much been spot on. Siri is not smart, but it does do a good job of doing basic things reliably. Simple questions such as weather, commanding smart home equipment and sports scores are no issue, but as many people have already commented on, you wont find any abilities outside of Apples own services.</p>
<p>Music is its strength and will often find the correct track with limited information. I have confidence that the HomePod <em>could</em> become an extremely capable device given the computing power inside. However this potential needs to be developed by Apple during a time when software is not its strong point. Siri on the HomePod could become a make or break device, and it is ultimately Apples privacy stance that is holding Siri back. Post CES it is clear that Amazon and particularly Google are pushing their digital assistants as a platform rather than something as a side bar to a mobile OS.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I was dead set on returning the HomePod after I had played around with it. My Sonos speakers have been one of the best devices I have spent money on, and I found it hard to believe they could be replaced.</p>
<p>However given a very small time with the HomePod both myself and <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/962050054541295618">the family</a> have been converted. The device has already replaced two Sonos Play:1 speakers upstairs and I will more than likely buy another to replace a Play:3 downstairs in time. This is said with a little resistance, as the HomePod only exists to keep iOS users in the ecosystem and gain Apple Music subscribers. Yes Spotify works in a round about way, but the experience is much better with Apple Music.</p>
<p>Although the smart aspects of the HomePod leaves a lot to be desired, so does using Alexa with my Sonos speakers. There <em>are</em> a lot of features that I feel are missing from the device to make every user happy, however for me the device is more than capable of doing what I require. Apple really needs to pull out all the stops this WWDC and introduce many platform changes to Siri for risk of being even further behind.</p>
<p>The HomePod is fine for me, but may not be enough if you are looking for an assistant rather than simply great sound. Siri, although very capable, feels like an afterthought and won’t please everyone.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>After exploring other options to sharing on social media and <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-01-20-using-microblog/">using Micro.blog</a> I’m stuck. There doesn’t seem to be the perfect option out there to fulfil all of my needs so for now I still to my own blog.</p>
<p>Now comes the issues with posting lots of updates and where they need to go. Ultimately there are a few things I want to achieve.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping content mine as much as possible</li>
<li>post to other social media platforms</li>
<li>not clog up longer blog post streams or RSS</li>
</ul>
<p>Since my blog is already built on Jekyll and hosted on Github I set to work to hit as many of these goals as possible.</p>
<h2><strong>Keep content mine</strong></h2>
<p>The main feature of my <a href="/">micro.blog usage was for Daring Fireball style link posts</a>. Short quotes from other peoples articles (linking back to them) and a few words (sub 150) from my self as a comment. I built a Workflow to do this easily on micro.blog so sharing these shouldn’t be a major issue.</p>
<h3><strong>Micro Blog Collection</strong></h3>
<p>Inside your _config.yml set up a collection with a name of your choice. Seeing as this will be aimed at micro blog I went for something easy.</p>
<pre><code>Collections:
micro:
 output: true
 permalink: /micro/:title
</code></pre>
<p>This will mean that posts in this collection will not be posted to the main index page and also not in the main RSS feed. Create a folder called _micro for all the micro posts to go into.</p>
<h3><strong>Micro Blog Index</strong></h3>
<p>In the main repo create a file called micro.html and set the YAML with a permalink as /micro/index.html. Example below:</p>
<pre><code>—
permalink: permalink: /link/index.html</code></pre>
<h2 id="title:linkposts">title: Link Posts</h2>
<p>Then it’s time to get all of your posts listed, this is pretty easy to do and will ultimately be dictated by what info you will want to see on an index page, the below is the contents of mine. This page will then be found at /micro/.</p>
<pre><code>{ % for item in site.micro reversed % }</code></pre>
<article class="post-preview">  { % if item.link % }
 <a>
  </a>
<h2> </h2>
<a>
  </a>   { % else %}   
<h2> </h2>
{ % endif % }   
<p> </p>
</article>
<pre><code>
{ % endfor % }
</code></pre>
<p>I have chosen to only show the title and then all of the content as these will only be small posts. The If item.link is unique to my use case and means that if I set a link in my YMAL front matter the title will link to this URL in a similar vein to Daring Fireball.</p>
<p>The</p>
<article>tag is set in my CSS and simply adds in the same formatting as my blog and separates the posts neatly.
<p>If in doubt copy the content from your index.html and add in <code>{ % for item in site.micro reversed % }</code>.</p>
<h3><strong>Micro Blog RSS Feed</strong></h3>
<p>This might come as a shock but if you’ve got a regular blog people won’t want to read a barrage of micro updates. So a collection and separate RSS feed is a must. This is the easiest part of the set up. Simply create a file called micro.xml and add the following:</p>
<pre><code>—</code></pre>
</article>
<p>  Hello Friends https://gr36.com</p>
<pre><code>{ % for post in site.micro reversed % }
<pre><code>&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;




https://gr36.com
https://gr36.com
</code></pre>
<p>{ % endfor % }
</code></pre></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>All of your posts in the Micro collection will now be delivered through this separate RSS feed. So you can set this to post to social media through IFTTT or many other places as you desire however there are limitations.</p>
<h2><strong>Cross Posting</strong></h2>
<p>This is where I fall down. I haven’t found a way to share full posts that are below 280 characters straight to twitter and longer ones as links. I am pretty sure this is achievable however I stopped short when realising almost every one of my posts was way past this limit.</p>
<p>I believe there may be a way to do this with a limited RSS of 280 characters. However in practice this hasn’t worked for me to auto post through IFTTT. If this is a major issue for you then micro.blog is the place for you!</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps with improving your Jekyll site and can be modified to your use cases for collections. I am currently adapting this to add in a few collections so the possibilities are endless.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>So. Deep breath and we will begin my attempt to leave Twitter and still be social. Timothy Smith summed this up perfectly when talking about micro blog by saying “I wanted to get away from Twitter. If you don’t get why, that’s ok”. For my attempt I decided that I needed something that would still allow me to share blog posts and BYOD podcast episodes, but keep me away from the cesspool that is Twitter. I just hadn’t decided what this was yet, and Micro.blog seemed my best bet.</p>
<p>I instantly gelled with much of their platform, both <a href="https://gr36.com/link/">not worrying about numbers</a> and the <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE ethos</a>. This isn’t the first time I have contemplated the worry of owning all of my content. I moved to my own blog for my writing, but this also branches out to Twitter and Facebook. I’m not an artist that relies on their social media for income, but if the service dies one day I’d be pretty annoyed all my tweets disappeared. That is where Micro.blog comes in or in the IndieWebCamp’s POSSE approach : publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere.</p>
<p>You have all of your content on your own website, and it posts to other services of your choice inside their own restrictions. For example posts over 280 characters need to be truncated for Twitter. Micro.blog has the added benefit of no follower count, no stats and none of the associated stress. The creator Manton Reece specific left out these things so there is no influence and no popularity contest.</p>
<h2>To The Micro Blogs!</h2>
<p>For a long time the platform was invite only, with Kickstarter backers getting first dibs on user names. However sign ups are now open and you can be sending micro blog updates in a few minutes. The platform is really easy to get to grips with, although there are in-depth settings to customise the look of your blog and where your posts will appear.</p>
<p>There are already loads of people using Micro.blog to post updates, however they are not easily discoverable. There is a ‘Discover’ tab but this tends to be the same or similar people. Unless people point you to their account or are mentioned by others it is extremely difficult to find them. With that said the platform is less about consuming and more about posting. With the no follower count ethos they have neglected ease of engagement. If users cant find others with similar interests or even contrasting once then engagement is stuck.</p>
<p>With that said the small team of developers are adding in new features all the time. They have avoided the #hashtag and are using Emoji for search instead. The tester is for books, however new ones are planned once usage is established.</p>
<p>The small team of developers has a massive advantage with the fact they can move fast and adapt very quickly. It is very early days for the new platform so new features are coming thick and fast. The small team also offers exceptional support with issues, I even got a personal response from the creator!</p>
<h2>Using the app</h2>
<p>Unfortunately there is a downside to only being a very small team, and the quality starts to show when using the iOS apps. This is not the selling point of microblog and perhaps if more apps supported the API (looking at you Ulysses) then arguably the app wouldn’t even be needed. Although it looks terrible everything works and works well.</p>
<p>There is loads of white, or grey, space and I have no doubt these spaces will have things fill it in the near future. The service is still pretty new and the whole point is getting you in charge of your content, so is mainly web based. There are a few other apps that support posting to Micro.blog so some of them may be better suited to your needs.</p>
<h2>URL Support</h2>
<p>Information on URL support is very thin on the ground, there is no official documentation although there is an open API.</p>
<p>I stumbled across the callback URL for posting by accident when searching for Workflow examples. To open straight into the app the following can be used.</p>
<p><code>microblog://post?text= </code></p>
<p>So you can append test to these to open straight into the app ready for posting. It would be pretty easy to put together Workflows to aid in this, I created a <a href="http://gr36.micro.blog/2018/01/06/workflows-for-microblog.html">couple and shared them on my micro.blog</a>.</p>
<h2>Cross Posting</h2>
<blockquote><p>We believe in the IndieWebCamp’s POSSE approach : publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere. Some of the advantages they list for cross-posting include owning your content, reducing third-party dependencies, canonical URLs, and better search. – Micro Blog</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of the things lacking if I tried to build my own personal ‘thing’ that cross posted. I <a href="https://brightlycolored.org/2017/02/creating-a-microblog-with-jekyll/">still cant work out</a> how to post things less than 280 characters directly to Twitter and turn longer posts into a linked blog post. Micro.blog does this perfectly, allowing you to write exactly what you feel. Small posts are transferred straight to Twitter and/or Facebook and longer posts are truncated and linked to.</p>
<p>It’s as if you were posting things directly to Twitter, except your not. Major plus that you don’t loose yourself in posts from others, but a major downside if others try and engage with you. This was one of the reasons I finally deleted my Facebook account because leaving a ‘ghost’ account is perhaps not the best practice.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So in reality you end up using both apps, and it doesn’t give you the freedom you may seek. Micro.blog is less a freedom from social media as hinted at, but more about content ownership. Which is the smaller of the two concerns if I had to rank them.</p>
<p>The platform shows great potential with more apps adding support for sharing and reading all the time. The small development has its downfalls with app polish, but makes up for it in brilliant support and emails answered almost straight away. New features are being added all the time so I’m definitely going to keep my eye on it. I’ve eased myself back into Twitter in the mean time.</p>

<p>Apple <a href="https://www.imore.com/why-apple-slows-down-old-iphone-models">didn’t apologise</a> for slowing your phone down. Not because of arrogance, not because they don’t care, but because they really didn’t have to. A phone getting slower over time is really not the issue here, the issue is transparency and communication (and perhaps a little bit of urban legend).</p>
<p>As each new operating system upgrade hits devices, the belief is that older devices become unusable to force you to upgrade your device. It’s a tale that doesn’t need to be true, because it is already believed by the masses. Planned obsolescence is a phrase routed in marketing but popularised in modern day through Apple devices. The general consensus is that through Systemic Obsolescence or prevention of repairs, the company pushes you to abandon older devices and purchase a new one.</p>
<p>In fact it doesn’t matter in what way they do it, but to maintain growth they must push users to upgrade. So when Apple first confirmed it slowed down older device with degrading battery performance, and then<a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/">apologised for it lack of communication</a>, many people took this as a conformation of what they already believed to be true.</p>
<p>The truth is Apple did this to maximise the battery life users will get from their phone. Smaller capacity batteries and an optimised OS only goes so far. As the battery degrades the capacity shrinks even more, it happens to every phone but most others have much bigger batteries to start with. Unfortunately not communicating that the OS was doing this to aid the user have come back and bitten Apple – Hard.</p>
<p>This is an issue that will run deeper that the tech press and more savvy users. It is one that has already bleed into the mainstream media, and no doubt into the purchasing decisions of average consumers. I wonder how many people will have that feeling at the back of their mind that Apple might slow down their phones. The tech sphere know the reasons, and most seem to understand why they do it. However slowness really isn’t the issue.</p>

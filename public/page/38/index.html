<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Since moving all of my proverbial <a href="/2022/12/05/one-contact-point.html">social media eggs into one basket,</a> it has become obvious that a noisy feed sucks. Don’t get me wrong, there are some gigantic benefits from following everyone from one app, and not doing my usual bounce around several apps to elevate boredom. Unfortunately, I doubt that the best pace for this is micro.blog because it’s making my experience worse.</p>
<p>Like many users on the service, <a href="/2018/01/20/using-microblog-aka.html">I use micro.blog</a> because it <a href="/2021/04/11/time-to-slow.html">is slow</a>, thoughtful and much quieter than most places on the internet. Currently, Mastodon is the opposite of that ethos, it’s fast-paced, constantly updating and in many ways just like Twitter. Which is fine, I love Mastodon, but the very nature of the service is ruining my one soils away from the noise, and unfortunately, it lacks robust filtering and muting options.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c8e763011e.jpg" alt="Dall -E: illustration of a stressed person with a mobile phone" title="Dall -E: illustration of a stressed person with a mobile phone"></p>
<p>This is no slight against the service, there has been absolutely no reason for me to need it until now, I’ve never felt the need to mute or even unfollow anyone before. The only options available for me currently is a timeline with all posts, or one without replies. The saving grace is third-party app Gluon, but this doesn’t carry over into using micro.blog on the web, which I do the majority of the time. To get the best from the environment I am trying to create, I require some filtering or dare I say it, a sorting algorithm.</p>
<p>I get it, that’s never going to happen. The presumption is that implementing machine learning for sorting your feed and prioritising some posts is always bad. When the truth is that for a truly scalable social platform it should be a priority. It doesn’t have to maximise user engagement or any other trap of the attention economy, it just has to quieten down your feed. It really is <a href="/2021/04/22/the-problem-of.html">a problem of scale</a>. I could quite happily follow hundreds of people on Twitter, but couldn’t even think about that kind of number of any other service.</p>
<p>I am thrilled that so many people have left Twitter behind, but the increased engagement with Mastodon means I need to find a way to escape every now and again. For now, I believe I will have to split these two services apart again to make sure I can hide away from the noise some of the time.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Yesterday<a href="/2022/12/13/my-favourite-reading.html"> I posted</a> that I had jumped in with the new pricing strategy for Matter and become a <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/patron">Patron subscriber</a>. Strangely, I thought that most people had heard of this amazing ‘Read it later’ app as it was the new hotness for a while. Following some questions on why I choose to use it and comparisons to other services, I thought I’d cover a the main thing I like about it.</p>
<p>The app has been a staple on my iPhone and iPad for what seems like forever, and giving back £130 for my free usage and receiving another 3 years of service thrown in is the least I could contribute. First things first, I honestly have no idea why I use it over another service. Not because it isn’t great, but because I haven’t used a whole load of different options and I just enjoy using <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/">Matter,</a> so never look around. They’re a risk, like with note app, that you can spend too much time moving about and not enough time reading.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/cd83a5fb77.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>When it started, Matter had built into it a social side where you could follow friends and see what they were reading and see highlights and comments from them. I really enjoyed this part, and after spending a little over a year helping to <a href="https://www.getupnext.com/">develop Upnext</a> I jumped ship to Matter. Using the free app to save all the content I found around the web to consume later. Matter calls itself “a better reader” and on the surface it is exactly that. You can save links from all over the web, not just articles, and access them later to read in a much better environment.</p>
<p>The app offers highlighting, commenting, leaving notes on sections you’re interested in, and all the usually expected functions of a reading app. The exceptional side to Matter is that it then combines with everything else to make your consumption of things better. Including an excellent integration with Gmail that pulls newsletters into your subscriptions tab with no interaction needed. This is especially useful for longer editions that I receive from <a href="https://www.platformer.news/">Platformer</a> or <a href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/">Galaxy Brain</a>.</p>
<p>I can then highlight and takes notes on the parts that I want to remember later, and send them to wherever it is that I intend to save them. Matter already integrates with note-taking apps like Roam Research, Logseq and Obsidian, but I can also send them straight into <a href="/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html">my Apple Notes system</a> or write about them in Ulysses. More often than not, though, I can archive them into my permanent folder and refer to them later on if needed.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/98992a96bc.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>All of this has been free for months, and even when they introduce the Subscription in January you will only pay if you want things like fluid highlighting, note-taking and integrations. It will remain a totally free read it later service with <strong>no ads</strong>. I think this is why I could never see myself using anything else. I love the app, it works well and does even more than I require it too, but I also trust the company. They are not using my consumption data to show me ads or sell it on for a quick profit.</p>
<p>The company now has a robust business model (it was a bit of a concern before, but I expected a subscription eventually) and see themselves as being around for years to come. There are other services around, I was a long-time user of Pocket, but Matter have built up for me as such it is and will continue to be my most used app. It continues to get better and better and now with even more funding behind it there are exciting time to come.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>For a long time, I have never thought about the topics that I write about. Granted, I still think I am some kind of tech reporter, but I have no desired to actually write about the topics needed to become one (plus I suck). I much prefer to publish things that come to mind and let others decide whether they want to read dit or not. Only when Jarrod kindly <a href="https://jarrod.micro.blog/2022/12/12/for-micro-monday.html">encouraged people to read my blog</a> because I wrote about writing did I think about how meta my blog is.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about why I write, so I guess this seems like a logical step from thought to publish. Many of the people I follow seem to struggle with either wanting to write more and not having a subject, or pigeonhole themselves to a point they feel trapped. The truth is, I often start typing away intending to publish something without even a topic in mind. The tactile feedback from my keyboard is enough to keep my happy for a little while.</p>
<p>I don’t have ‘a thing’. There isn’t one area that motivates me to write about it, there is just me. I think that is the reason that my posts meander around some topics, but rarely stay still. There’s some tech, some personal things, some really random posts, but mostly it is just what is going on in my head. That is why a service like micro.blog suits me so well, because there’s only one blog with everything posted to it. I don’t have to worry about <a href="/2021/02/13/where-does-this.html">where this post goes</a> or if it fits in with a certain site.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with the meta posts on my blog, but I think I need to expand a bit more. Last year I brought in a <a href="/2021/11/07/a-writing-kanban.html">writing Kanban board</a> that allowed me to be the <a href="/2021/11/30/writing-everyday-is.html">most active</a> I have ever been, but I feel that these posts will still revolve around the same topics without some effort on my part. We’ll see.</p>

     <p>I’m pretty certain, if it doesn’t exist already, that in the near future you will be able to predict my mental state from my blog posts. They show where my thoughts are currently and often what is going on in my life. I enjoy posting, but there is something exposing about hitting publish and your words being there for all to see, but it is one of the best things you can do.</p>
<p>Everyone does what I do. Except they vent into private chat groups, social media DMs and sometimes on social media itself. They express themselves through words, or increasingly voice notes, to let others know what they are feeling — they just don’t do it as publicly as others. Though they really should.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2a84d41524.jpg" alt="Dall-E digital art of someone writing in the street "></p>
<p>This isn’t another one of those posts where I try to <a href="/2022/12/02/you-deserve-a.html">convince everyone to get a blog</a>, nor is it one where I <a href="/2022/11/17/ten-days-no.html">have a go at Social Media</a>. It is more of a realisation of the way that writing in public makes you feel. Embarrassed, sometimes down, but more often than not I feel relief and closure from the words I publish. I sometimes struggle to allow myself to feel the things I do so publicly, but the intrinsic rewards of every post are overwhelmingly positive.</p>
<p>That is not to imply that i don’t sometimes have to keep <a href="/2021/02/11/needing-feedback.html">a lid on my ego</a>, and think about the reasons I am writing my post — but over the years this has become rare. The reasons I post are because I think that someone out there might read my things and like it, but even if they don’t, I enjoyed doing so in public. Allowing myself to feel exposed and ensure the things that I may otherwise have shared privately are indeed correct. There is nothing like shining a light on your thoughts and ideas to let you know where the cracks in them are.</p>
<p>I might regret it in the future when the robot overlords take over, but it&rsquo;s all I’ve known for more than a decade and I love it.</p>

     <p>Since Twitter imploded, I am ecstatic that a lot of the wonderful people I have met online have followed me out. It gives me even less reason to <a href="/2022/12/01/104000.html">think about</a> going back, but I’ve seen some bubbling thoughts about returning. What social network you choose to use shouldn’t be this hard, but I do know why there are these lingering doubts, and it’s mainly to do with FOMO.</p>
<p>The Fear Of Missing Out is a powerful motivator. Hell, it’s the reason, historically, I <a href="/2019/12/16/losing-minimal.html">bought so much tech</a>. I see things online, and they look cool, so I feel like I’m missing out on something. This is precisely what others are starting to feel, they are under the impression they are missing out on things happening, and that feeling sucks. However, it’s important to think if you actually <em>are</em> missing out or the feelings are unfounded.</p>
<p>I understand. Your followers have more than halved, and there are people who did not follow you to where it is you’re hanging out now. Are you actually missing out though? Think of some specific things you are missing out on, or is it just the thought of not being there when something happens? That’s what kept me on Twitter so long, and I’m sure loads of other people.</p>
<p>Look, you can use whatever platform you want, and you certainly shouldn’t feel like you can’t use something because other people have left. You should love what you love, hate what you hate <a href="/2021/06/12/hate-what-you.html">and enjoy it</a>. The feelings you feel are just that, feelings. Unless you need to be there to cover every new thing, there’s a lot of enjoyment in missing out (EOMO) on things. Most of which will pass you buy, and you won’t care, and the important things will get to you no matter what.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>There are a few unsolvable questions in my life. What iPhone will I actually use? Which read it later service is the best one? Will I ever stop changing notes apps and actually write some notes? Perhaps the biggest ones revolve around social media. I haven’t been <a href="/2018/05/25/intentional-twitter-usage.html">happy with my usage of it</a> for years, but still as yet can’t find a solution.</p>
<p>This is frankly a ridiculous issue to have, but my feeling on Social Media boil down to my relationship with Twitter. I love it, well perhaps loved is the better word. The microblogging service has meant I have met some really awesome people that have become close friends, but has also ruined my attention span and <a href="/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html">given me a boredom avoidance crutch</a> for too long. I am in many ways thankful the billionaire baby ruined the experience, so I could fully leave. Since then, I have spent <a href="/2022/12/01/104000.html">too much time worrying about</a> where to spend my time.</p>
<p>I still found myself bouncing around from app to app when boredom struck, and having too many places to check, transferred my addiction rather than solved it. So, with a great deal of trepidation, I decided to go all in on micro.blog and <a href="/2022/12/02/moving-my-mastodon.html">forward my Mastodon account to it</a>. One app with <a href="/2022/12/04/i-am-really.html">all of my social media usage</a> in it was a risk, there are some massive advantages but also so downsides that I have to think about.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/22b9a2fdca.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="much-calmer">Much Calmer</h2>
<p>Although micro.blog uses ActivityPub and allows you to follow any other accounts that use the indieweb protocol, it isn’t Mastodon. As such, there <em>are</em> things that I miss out on. The most obvious being that it doesn’t show boosts. This is a bit of a controversial point on Mastodon, but this removal has actually improved my enjoyment.</p>
<p>I was one of the people that was calling for Mastodon to introduce boosts with comment, but now I really do understand why it isn’t there, and I really enjoy not having boosts at all. Admittedly, it <em>does</em> cut down on discoverability a bit, but I maintain that good people to follow will always come around. I love the interaction and conversations on Mastodon, and these still show up and allow me to still find new people.</p>
<p>Using micro.blog I also cannot see any local or federated timelines, so some openness of Mastodon is cut off. The flip side is that I am not lost scrolling through lists and feeds looking for something to entertain, and overall has made me ‘check in’ much less. Only worrying about the last few things that are happening and my mentions.</p>
<h2 id="less-control">Less Control</h2>
<p>Being the worrier that I am, giving up control of my one sole access to social media is a bit of a gamble. What if micro.blog were to suffer an issue, or stop working completely? Perhaps they change the way it works by some way I don’t like, or increase the pice by an untenable amount. Much like Twitter, micro.blog is controlled by one person who makes all the decisions, but I trust <a href="https://www.manton.org">Manton</a> a lot more than I trust Musk.</p>
<p>Being a smaller used service, there is not the choice of apps that there are for Mastodon. Although everything is open source, the demand does not facilitate numerous apps being created. The official app is fine, but this is something to be aware of when you’re all in on a service. It could be worse, I could be forced to use the WordPress app!</p>
<h2 id="diversity-of-followers">Diversity Of Followers</h2>
<p>Having used micro.blog on and off for years, I am aware that the people who make up its user base tend not to be very diverse (with exceptions of course). The barrier to entry of the service tends to mean that the topics discussed are very cyclical and insular in nature. Whereas Mastodon is the opposite. Although a little nerdy to understand, I have found a far more diverse set of people to follow than I ever did on Twitter.</p>
<p>Making sure that this exists is an important way for me to gain a wide range of opinions on topics. By adding in Mastodon, I feel this is much easier to achieve, although I do feel as if this may be harder going forward given my inability to browse timelines and not see all posts. However, by being mindful of this, I should avoid building myself an echo chamber.</p>
<h2 id="removal-of-the-social-media-trappings">Removal Of The Social Media Trappings</h2>
<p>Using micro.blog also removed all the follower counts and social media shenanigans that taint any service. Granted, Mastodon does not use ranking algorithms and the like, but does have hashtags that are gamed and some users that yearn for attention. This is all stripped away on micro.blog and Manton has been <a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/11/07/microblog-mastodon.html">clear</a> that he will continue down this line. In his words, “compatibility with Mastodon lets us support the good things that Mastodon has accomplished, while still carrying forward what, I think, are the unique strengths of Micro.blog.”</p>
<h2 id="lack-of-mute">Lack Of Mute</h2>
<p>One part of Mastodon I absolutely loved was the powerful muting. I quickly set up a range of filters that meant politics nor Twitter craziness graced my feed. None of this exists on micro.blog bar muting users. I have hope that perhaps this will improve in the future, however as yet I have not seen any of this. I have a feeling that boosts may cut a lot of this out, however I will need to keep a real eye on things.</p>
<p>With all things said it does worry me having one point of contact with all of the social web, but so far I have found it very calming. I have removed the issues surrounding consuming the internet in bit side chunks and calmed down my feed. How long this confidence lasts will be interesting but at the moment is has been a good decision. I own all of the content I put out now and it is all on one place, syndicated to wherever I want it to.</p>

     <p>Several people still point to <a href="/2021/04/01/how-i-set.html">my older post</a> on how I post to my blog using automation. Unfortunately, some of these Shortcuts no longer work or can be done better, so I decided to update them. Here’s all the Shortcuts I use to publish and use micro.blog to help you automate your life.</p>
<h2 id="microblog-post-search">Micro.blog Post Search</h2>
<p>I love linking my posts together and making sure I reference and expand on previous thoughts. The easiest way to do this is to search on micro.blog for the old posts, and you can do this with one tap.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e6c3cfa50e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Grab the Shortcut <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/81a80d6045d641978c9a4a625b382913">here</a>, and change the text to your account ID number found by doing a post search and getting the numbers after <code>/posts/</code>and before <code>?q</code>.</p>
<h2 id="image-upload">Image Upload</h2>
<p>For those that include images in your posts and want to upload them beforehand, they usually lean on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">Mimi uploader</a>. An excellent third-party app that helps you do this with one image or full albums of them. However, this Shortcut will do all that for you if you do not need the graphical front end.</p>
<p>Grab it <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ec0296b20f9041daa60abceb634bccd7">here </a>and place your app token in the top text box. Once run, this will ask you to select the images you want to upload and then ask of the alt text of them. Once done, you will have the Markdown syntax for all of your images copied to your clipboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/26a3643377.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="post-to-microblog">Post To Microblog</h2>
<p>This <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fa9fa172631740c1a124eb34e2d01d0b">basic Shortcut</a> forms the backbone of other ones I have built for my posting style. However, it comes in very useful if you want to post from apps that don’t support publishing to micro.blog. So, you can turn your simple text editor of choice into a publishing app by sharing the text to this Shortcut.</p>
<h2 id="life-update">Life Update</h2>
<p>For the last few weeks, I’ve been using this updated version instead of my <a href="/2022/10/17/how-i-use.html">status.lol Shortcut</a> with all the updates of my life. Mine is a pretty boring one, but the Shortcut has allowed me to post things effortlessly.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f3c8fc2be0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Grab it <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d5d12d9b2ced48afaedd4d81894e1841">here</a></p>
<p>I made this modular this time so that other Shortcuts I made can be used. This makes both making the Shortcut and understand what is going on easier. You will need the image upload shortcut, the post to micro.blog shortcut and the omg.lol status Shortcut shown above.</p>
<p>Once saved to my Homescreen I can post a feeting status or a more permanent post to micro.blog. I use this multiple times a day to share <a href="/categories/micro/">micro posts</a> and some of <a href="/photos/">my photography</a>.</p>

     <p>Well, first things first. I am not really moving my Mastodon account to micro.blog in the technical sense but rather forwarding everything, but if you’re reading this you want to do the same. Thankfully, the process is pretty easy, and you won’t need much knowledge to do it.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to do this, is that I can follow Mastodon accounts (or any other ActivityPub service) from inside micro.blog and didn’t see the point using two apps to do the same things. I went <a href="/2022/11/30/shortcut-find-mastodon.html">backwards and forwards</a> on which way I was going to do this, and <a href="/2022/12/01/snacking-on-the.html">decided that a quieter timeline</a> on micro.blog was the way I wanted to go. My only concern was leaving my other Mastodon account on <a href="https://social.lol/">social.lol</a> empty and losing the people that I follow.</p>
<p>I first created an <a href="/2022/11/30/shortcut-find-mastodon.html">iOS Shortcut</a> to find the accounts that I wanted to follow on micro.blog. For more information about following ActivityPub accounts on micro.blog check out the help docs <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/activitypub/95">here</a>. I gave this a day or so to see if this was the way I wanted to go, and then went all in.</p>
<h2 id="microblog-alias">Micro.blog Alias</h2>
<p>On micro.blog head to Account &gt; ActivityPub and click set Mastodon compatible username. The default for this is your micro.blog username, so mine would be <code>@gr36@micro.blog</code> I changed this to one using my custom url and to keep things nice and simple I chose <code>@greg@gr36.com</code>. Once you have done this, your username will appear in a box at the top of the page, next to this click Aliases.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9cb404633a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here, you add in your ‘old’ Mastodon account that you want to transfer followers from and forward all traffic. You can add multiple aliases here if you need to.</p>
<h2 id="mastodon-move">Mastodon Move</h2>
<p>On your Mastodon instance, head to Settings &gt; Account and towards the bottom you will see Move to a different account. Here you need to add in your new micro.blog Mastodon compatible username, and then put in your password.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/024480d6ca.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I would like to point out that you can only migrate once every 30 days, and that the process may take a while to complete. All of your followers will be moved across to the micro.blog account and if anyone replies to your ‘old’ account this will also show up in micro.blog.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/eb021f290d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Although you <em>can</em> unlink these if you want to open your account back up again, I have not tested this. I have no idea if your followers or content come back again, so consider this destructive, unless you find out otherwise and please let me know.</p>

     <p>When I see what some people pay for a blog, I gasp. I mean, I get it, I want to publish things as much as the next person, and I admire the dedication, but the costs some people stand to write on the internet makes my eyes water. I wonder if these types of costs are what stop more people having a blog?</p>
<p>It’s no secret I think everyone <a href="/2021/03/22/the-value-of.html">should have a blog</a>, they should write about whatever it that they want to write about if only to get it out of themselves. I am not alone in the feeling, and the great news is that, as Andrew Canion <a href="https://canion.blog/2022/12/01/humansized-services.html">points out</a>, “the internet is healing”. There is a whole range of awesome services popping up and really great prices that should entice more people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is wonderful to see quality products being run by quality people, without any the social media chicanery. This is the way. Long may it last. - <a href="https://canion.blog/2022/12/01/humansized-services.html">Andrew Canion</a></p></blockquote>
<p>He is current testing out the new <a href="https://weblog.lol">Weblog feature</a> of OMG.lol, one of the ridiculously cheap services that are seeing a resurgence. For just $5 a year you can have a great social media landing page, a ready-made community on Mastodon and <a href="https://home.omg.lol">loads more</a>. This isn’t an advert, but it is just one of the services worth noting as you consider your place on the internet, post Twitter.</p>
<p>My personal favourite is micro.blog which takes a bit of work to set up and get going, but you’ve also got <a href="https://blot.im">Blot</a>, <a href="https://write.as/">Write.as</a> and even <a href="https://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> seeing a resurgence. There is absolutely no need to revert to the <a href="https://wordpress.com">expensive services</a> that control a vast amount of the web, and even less of an excuse to start publishing online. You do not have to put yourself under any kind of pressure on a subject to write about, just let yourself publish whatever it is you want to say.</p>
<p>You really do deserve a blog, and to get writing online. More so now than ever before — what are you waiting for?</p>

     <p>Due to the billionaire baby, I’ve been thinking far too much about social media. I can see no end to the news coverage of Twitter or the various escapades on Elmo, and other platforms are just revolving conversations of the same. Mastodon feels like you’re spending time with a begrudged ex that won’t talk about anything else. As such, those topics bleed through into my thoughts, into my writing and seemingly into every part of my life.</p>
<p>Woe betide anyone who brings up Twitter in real life, you will get schooled on my latest thoughts and wish you ever asked! When I published the latest in my long line of posts about social media this morning, I considered I might have a problem on my hands. In my effort to get away from the subject, I am actually making matters worse and perhaps thinking about it too much when in reality it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c115c3a7b1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>To any normal person, it is a pretty easy decision on social media platforms. Use it or not. The conversation or thoughts on the subject go no further. Yet in my internet riddle brain I must way up where people are, who is using the service and then worry about whether it is good for me or not. I wholly blame Twitter for this. Never in the history of humankind have so many users hated being in a place, but not been able to help being drawn back to it. What I must consider is that those unique ambivalent feelings probably won’t exist again.</p>
<p>My thoughts about social media go deeper than they should. In many respects, that is a good thing. Spending some time considering where you place your time is a practice missing from most people’s lives. It can go too far, though. I spend too much time thinking and writing about Twitter that I might as well use it. I am not looking for some self gratification that my decision to leave was right, as most of Mastodon seem to be. Yet, social media is too often occupying my brain when I have better things to write about.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>On a recent <a href="https://www.byodpodcast.com/episodes/episode-28-it-looks-like-this-turkey-is-taking-a-selfie/17/11/2017">episode of Bring Your Own Device,</a> I was adamant that the recent control centre indicator was a weird bug and would soon go away. Yet here we are with iOS 11.2 now public, and it’s still there! The reason I was so sure is that Apple has never relied on indicating things more than once – the reason I was wrong is that Apple doesn’t seem to know what they are doing any more.</p>
<p>There appears to be a massive issue with consistency in Apple Software. Pick up any of this year&rsquo;s new devices running iOS 11 and swipe up from the bottom of the screen. The three current devices all do entirely different things for this one gesture. A swipe up on the iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 (all currently sold be Apple) accesses the Control Centre and has done since implementation in iOS7 back in 2013.
Perform the same gesture on the iPad and you will be treated with a floating doc of apps, or the multitasking screen, depending on the length of your swipe. Pick up the new iPhone X, however, and you will go to the home screen or invoke multitasking should you pause slightly at the end of your gesture. This isn’t an issue for most of us, but the inconsistency leads to some frustration when moving between devices.</p>
<h2 id="inconsistent-gestures">Inconsistent Gestures</h2>
<p>Apple has slowly backed away from teaching users with its UI design. Gone is the “Swipe To Unlock” bar that Steve introduced with the first iPhone, replaced simply by “Swipe To Open” should you pause long enough on the lock screen, and it looks like you might need help. So ingrained is the swipe gesture that everyone seems <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/10/13/baby-magazine-ipad/">to know what to do</a>. Yet so many people couldn’t find the Control Centre, Apple needed to place a line as a little hint.
The line doesn’t say anything, or indicate anything, yet there it is. A now constant reminder that a swipe up from the bottom may not do as you expect depending on what device you have in your hand. Say what you will about the inconsistency between Android devices, but the toggles and navigation buttons are always in the same place.</p>
<p>Granted, things might look a bit different, but most UI elements do the same thing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5ktm6g/android_back_button_vs_iphone_no_button/">(bar the back button)</a> and users can move pretty easily from one device to another. Perhaps as the current device lifespans progress, all models will adapt the same gesture-based UI. However, if there is one thing Apple like, is changing things for no good reason. As a page-based Control Center became a weird one-page mess, there’s now no telling how you access it.</p>

<p>Posts from The Verge go from the brilliant to the absurd, but one call to arms is perfect for the new year. Vlad Savov has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/2/16727510/death-to-microusb">declared his independence from MicroUSB</a> and I wish we could all do the same.</p></p>
<blockquote><p>
USB-C connectors are sturdier than MicroUSB, they’re now more common among the very latest tech, and they’re only going to increase in prevalence and importance as time goes on. My way of simplifying my life in 2018 will be to just embrace and demand USB-C. I’m ready to let the old MicroUSB standard go, and I suggest you do the same – Vlad Savov, My new year’s resolution: no more MicroUSB
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thankfully it is only headphones that are the sticking point to make the Apple eco system free from of this elderly port, but I can’t work out why.</p>
<h2>Beats Studio And Solo</h2>
<p>I really thought we had made a leap forward with the Beats line. Since being purchased by Apple they held onto MicroUSB for a while but then the BeatsX arrived with Lightning and all was right with the world. Granted this wasn’t USB-C but it was a dam site better than a connector from 2007.</p>
<p>However the PowerBeats3, Beats Solo 3 and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/5/16254778/beats-micro-usb-cables-while-apple-goes-usbc-lightning">brand new Beats Studio 3</a> that followed are still equipped with MicroUSB. Perhaps Apple are reluctant to put Lightning into every Beats headphone, but there is absolutely no reason to still be using a Micro USB port on £300+ headphone released in 2017. This is especially true when considering the early push into USB-C with the MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>It’s arguable that we are taking about Beats Headphones and not Apple. It is unknown how much of a free entity the company really is, but given Apples ownership and advertising push they can be considered first party accessories. A whole load of accessories which Apple seem to be lacking courage with and need to push forward so we can do the same as Vlad. Down with MicroUSB!<br />

<p>The Verge summed it up perfectly in their post <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/2/16727238/apple-macos-ios-software-problems-updates">“Apple’s had a shockingly bad week of software problems”</a>. Apple have had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/01/apple-macos-high-sierra-bug/">twice fix a glaring bug with macOS</a> allowing access to machines, and also <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/12/02/apple-releases-ios-11-2/">date related reboot</a>s on iOS. It’s something that is becoming increasingly hard to stomach for users that have come to rely in the robust nature of the products coming from Cupertino. Unfortunately it also appears to be getting much worse.</p></p>
<p>It seems as though inherent traits appear the larger and larger that Apple become, and isn’t a uniquely Apple situation. The deterioration of Software standards and <a href="/post/2017-10-06-apple-design-failing/">hardware filled with compromises</a> resembles those of early 2000 Microsoft. Mix one large corporation with shareholders to satisfy, remove strong leadership and the result is a company that is removed from its user base. When you become more and more insulated from the outside world, and more and more people around you are simply employed to do as they are told, then you get less and less feedback.</p>
<p>Studio Neat have spoken about simular issues when <a href="https://www.relay.fm/inquisitive/3">talking to Myke Hurley</a>. They used Kickstarter successfully to not only fund products but also gage the reaction to them. Outside input is detrimental to making products that people actually want and not those that the team thinks they want. This will have been further impacted by Apples attempt to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/29/3051521/tim-cook-apple-will-double-down-on-secrecy-on-products">“double down” on security</a> which no doubt asks for much less external input due to the fear of leaks.</p>
<p>As a slap in the face, the vast majority of hardware leaks have <a href="https://www.byodpodcast.com/episodes/episode-29-democratisation-of-firmware-spelunking-with-special-guest-guilherme-rambo/25/11/2017">come from inside Apple</a>. I have no doubt that Apple listen to feedback, but how much can they really implement when the culture is so closed. Such is the trade off with using Apple hardware that you MUST be beholden to their decisions. If they begin to make wrong decisions, or those that are removed from what the user base really needs, then they have a serious problem.</p>
<p>There is a lot to be said about bugs being reported on social media and <a href="/post/2017-11-19-bugs-vs-noise/">the actually severity of them</a>, but these two bugs are inexcusable errors. I am one of the lucky ones, none of these issue have plagued me yet. However if I rely on my phone and the fact someone coded the wrong date won’t allow me to make important calls, I will soon be looking for an exit from the ecosystem.<br />

<p>It was long before the Apple Watch existed that I first slapped on a smarter wrist watch. As Garmin, Nike and Samsung were pushed aside for an Apple Watch- just one thing remianed. They have all pushed me to exercise better by keeping an eye on what I’m doing and giving me a kick when needed. Now that I’m using the third iteration of the Apple Watch, I really think it’s time for a rest.</p>
<p>By ‘gamifying’ activity Apple have found the market that really matters, getting more and more people moving inevitably leads to <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/apple-watches-are-dominating-the-wearable-marketcharts-2017-9">taking over the wearables market</a>. By doing so they have also implemented one of the most dangerous and addictive trends in fitness – streaks. Despite its popularity, this highly addictive pursuit of keeping the streak going can get people into trouble very quickly.</p>
<p>There is even a <a href="http://www.runeveryday.com/">United States Running Streak Association</a> (USRSA), which tracks people that run at least a mile a day “without the aid of crutches or sticks”. Adam Alters <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/irresistible/id1128615587&amp;at=100ltj4">book Irresistible</a> recounts several people that have gone to obscene lengths to keep this streak going, it doesn’t take a genius to work out why this is actually pretty bad for your health. The fact that USRSA needs to state you can’t use any aids should be warning enough not to start!</p>
<blockquote><p>Streaks uncover the major flaw with goal pursuit: you spend far more time pursuing the goal than you do enjoying the fruits of your success. – Irresistable, Adam Alter</p></blockquote>
<p>The pursuit and desire to exercise should come from within and not to make sure the yellow and the red line make a circle. Enjoyment and forfillment are one of the most important aspects in exercise and help immensely with improving mental heath.</p>
<p>Continuous activity is all very well, as long as it is sensible, and all the checks and balances are in place. If you’re injured, sick or just have more important things to do should you really be pushed and prodded to exercise?</p>
<h2>Dangers of the game</h2>
<p>Well that depends how sick. According to study in <a href="http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/45/12/987">British Journal of Sports Medicine</a> you should be fine pushing to your goal if it’s just a runny nose. However anything else should be treated with a few days rest along with at least a doctors visit. So iOS really shouldn’t be pushing you to exercise when you’re in no fit state to do so.</p>
<p>However keeping that streak going can be addictive as scrolling through social media. A couple of notifications with ‘motivational’ prodding could see some people heading to the gym when they really should be heading to bed. Rest and recovery is as important as the exercise you are completing. Doing too much is a recognised condition, and Overtraining Syndrome (OTS) can lead to reduced <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435910/">immune system, physiological and mental health issues</a>.</p>
<p>Hitting a move goal of a few hundred won’t lead to OTS, but the Apple Watch pushing you onto a higher and higher goal will. No one should be hitting their move goal everyday of the month. That is unless you are blazing past it 5 days out of 7 and just achieving it the other two. Unfortunately it seems Apple doesn’t want you to do that, achieve your move goal well and it will push you on to a higher and higher on. Whilst activity perusing a perfect month in September it pushed me from a 600 goal to one over 1000.</p>
<h2>Rest Day Solution</h2>
<p>If Apple want to do the best for their users, they must consider a rest day option in next years watchOS update. The option should exist for users to mark at least one day from 7 as a rest day and be pushed towards 1/2 of their usual tally.</p>
<p>This option is available already in a fashion, but is buried away behind a force press in the activity app. Users would be better served with the options being available from an Activity notification or clearly marked <em>Rest Day</em>. Doing so will enable those that have been pushed a little harder to achieve their move goal to get the rest they need, and also still allow those addicted to the game to keep the streak going.</p>
<p>There clearly needs to be limits set, there is no point users being able to mark every day as rest – however this could easily be linked to a set activity level or the move goal itself. Low (one rest day), High (two rest days) or any combination based on types of activity and stand hours.</p>
<p>Keeping people from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/11/health/sitting-increases-risk-of-death-study/index.html">sitting is vastly more important </a>than provoking slightly more exercise. However sitting down and resting one day a week would be best for all of us.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Whilst I have never been overly motivated to have a <a href="/post/2017-08-30-miss-dual-camera/">portrait mode capable handset</a>. Now I actually have the iPhone X I have enjoyed the odd occasion of trying out the feature. It definitely has some issues, especially using the front facing camera, but does get some great snaps. With that said I think Apple could do much better, and I can’t be the only one.</p>
<p>Self titled Apple analyst Rene Ritchie was critical of the way Google’s Pixel phones capture portrait mode shots. Although I can see the issue he is getting at, I think in many situations Google’s way could be better than Apples.</p>
<p>A picture should be as easy to capture as possible, and the increasing amount of camera options are getting in the way. The view finder is already cramped, and has not taken advantage of bigger screens on the Plus models and most notably the iPhone X. Apple lay out numerous camera options for live shooting, a few of which can be condensed or removed. Does the portrait option really need to be a shooting option? Also who shoots in ‘square’ any more?</p>
<h2>More intelligent shooting</h2>
<p>The Pixel way of applying the filter afterwards could be easier achieved and applied like HDR mode. The camera could and should be more intelligent and workout that this particular shot is a portrait and give me both pictures on the camera roll. Apple certainly has the ability to do this – according to some, Apple is <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/09/14/inside-apple-a11-bionic-and-silicon-team/">yet to take full advantage</a> of the huge potential inside the A11 Bionic chip.</p>
<p>I understand that it’s natural for those that have been using iOS devices for a number of years to think the Apple way is the best way. Settling on this decision simply because it’s the way you are used to is closed minded at best. In the case of portrait mode I think the ideal position is somewhere in the middle. Some indication that the image you are taking will create a portrait shot, but the processing and optimisation done afterward.</p>
<p>Users shouldn’t have to decide which ‘scene’ to use, or wonder if their snap will come out ok. Apple and others should be making these decisions for us and streamline the time from deciding to take a picture and pressing the shutter as much as possible. The options should indeed be there for those that want to tune the images to their liking. However in a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/benefits-shooting-auto-mode/">similar vein to all point and shoot cameras</a>, Apple need to develop a robust ‘auto mode’ and do all the hard work for the user.</p>
<p>Matt Birchler has <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/google-pixel-2-and-iphone-8-plus-camera-comparison/">been digging deep and comparing the differences</a> between Apple and Google between portrait mode approaches and it leads to some interesting comparisons. The great thing about Googles approach is that it will get better and better over time with little input from the user. Using services such as Google photos (unlimited <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/05/google-photos-pixel-2-limit/">back up until 2020 is given for free</a> with the Pixel 2) will clean up and improve the images over time. As always with anything Google there is a trade off with privacy, so for Apple any improvement would need to be done on device.</p>
<p>Portrait mode can be improved over time, and it is clear Apple are going all in on the dual camera so their attention must turn to improving the experience and the processing. Only then will the iPhone really catch up to the Pixel for ease of use.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Since <a href="/post/2017-11-06-apples-service-advantage/">collecting my iPhone X from Apple</a>on release day, my <a href="/post/2017-11-08-iphonex-impressions/">impressions of using the device</a> have gotten better and better. The size is perfect for me, splitting the difference between a <a href="/post/2017-07-17-smaller-phone-much-happier/">smaller phone in my pocket</a> and a larger screen to get things done. However the one huge sticking point in my enjoyment is Control Centre.</p>
<p>The notch has proved to be the most controversial design choice of the year. Yes it allows for more screen space but still packing in loads of new technology, but it also splits the status bar in two. Swiping from the left side brings down the cover page, and from the right reveals Control Centre. There is no way to change this so if you use your phone left handed you are in for a particularly palm stretching experience.</p>
<p>Whenever I stretch my thumb over by awkwardly shifting the fragile bit of technology in my hand I am immediately reminded of the Apple ‘thumb’ advert.</p>
<p>The demand for larger screens has meant Apple had to drop its previous stance, but without doubt this has lead to trade offs. Reachability is a work around for reaching areas of larger screens, but there is no denying that you must accept these trade off when choosing to use a larger device. With that said Control Centre is without doubt not one of these trade offs. The whole concept of this is to have toggles and quick launch options available quickly and easily.</p>
<p>It can no longer exist as a swipe up from the bottom as in previous generations, because this is now the gesture to go home, but even Android tried this interaction and it didn’t work then. The question is, where exactly could you put it?</p>
<p>There have been lots of options suggested for an easier accessed control on iPhone X, and it is clear Apple had other options on consideration. Guilherme Rambo uncovered a demo video inside the Tips app that showed the Control Centre as a page inside the multi-tasking view.</p>
<p>This would make it easier to access when using the phone one handed, but also add in extra gestures in order to access the ‘quick toggles’. Users would have to swipe up and pause (or another of the hundred ways people tell you to do it), then swipe over to Control Centre and then access the toggle they wish.</p>
<p>The best idea may be to adopt the same UI as with the iPad and build the toggles into the multi-task view. The app previews do not need to be a large as they are, and there would be plenty of space to add in extra content. The only downside to this would be access from the lock screen – so a quick fix isn’t easy to come by.</p>
<p>Lets hope I just become more used to Control Centre being more difficult to access, as let me honest, if the notch goes away in the next couple of generations then it will have to change AGAIN!</p>

<p>When Apple launched the Apple Watch, it was greeted with confused emotions. It tried too hard to be everything to everyone, however from watchOS 2 onwards the message has been clear. Notifications and health monitoring are the major benefits to everyone, recording activity levels and making users more engaged. Unfortunately from time to time the health data recorded is incorrect.</p>
<p>iOS should intelligently work out what device is being used and count from one device at a time. So for example if you have your iPhone in your pocket, but are also wearing your Apple Watch it will count steps from only one device. If you then put your phone down but keep walking, data is still recorded. However not all devices are equal, and iOS prioritises some more than others. If it values your phone above your watch, things can sometimes go a little wrong.</p>
<p>Thankfully there is an easy fix. Open up the Health app on your iPhone. Then tap the red Activity square. Tap ‘Steps or walking distance’, and then ‘Data Sources &amp; Access’. This will give you a list of all of your iOS devices that are recording health data. This could be filled with every device you have ever used, so could be a confusing mess.</p>
<p>In short, make sure all Apple Watches are above all iPhones. I have a huge long list of devices old and new – so I taped edit and moved all of my Apple Watches to the top and all iPhones after. This will make sure Apple Watch data is recorded at all times, unless it is not on your wrist. This should make your steps counts and activity levels much more accurate. Although if things are still not being recorded correctly you may have to look at other options – if in doubt <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb">speak to Apple directly</a>.</p>
<p>As a side note don’t remove any old or duplicate devices as this will remove the historic data from your Health app.</p>

      <p>For a long time the big blue F was my main social network for communicating with people, keeping up to date with news and just receiving boredom. However for the last few it has been left gathering nothing more than automatic posts and links because it really is a horrible place to spend much time. I’ve finally deleted my account for good, and not for the reasons you might expect.</p><p>There are may reasons to ditch Facebook. Huge concerns with the <a href="https://www.entitymag.com/11-creepy-ways-facebook-spying-right-now/">privacy of all of their mobile apps</a>, their apparent disregard for their involvement with fake news to name just two. Although it was a recent podcast from <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/esther-perel-online-dating/">Note to Self</a> that made me dig through the settings and find the delete account option. It introduced the concept of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ghosting">Ghosting to me</a>, a term that epitomises the don’t care attitude of modern society.</p><p>Where a person simply ignores a person that they don’t want to talk to any more.<br />This refers usually to online dating, but I didn’t want people that I was friends with on Facebook to think I was doing this to them. I’ve missed messages and comments on photos that I have not replied to, simply because I don’t log in any longer. All most posts are from other apps such as Instagram or IFTTT recipes. Conversations regarding a message someone sent me that wasn’t replied to are uncomfortable to explain, and I simply don’t want people to think I am treating them as if they don’t matter.</p><p>It’s very easy to miss understand intentions without visual clues so it’s completely reasonable friends would think I’m blanking them when people treat others as if they didn’t exist.<br />If we’re friends on Facebook I’m sorry for not being there any longer, however I haven’t been there really for a very long time — I was just a ghost.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>After picking up my <a href="/post/2017-11-06-apples-service-advantage/">iPhone X on Friday</a> it was immediately apparent that the new Apple device is not going to be everyones perfect device. Despite sporting a fantastic 5.8” OLED screen, the iPhone X is going to frustrate users of Plus model phones – and there is still a huge case for the iPhone Plus.</p>
<p>The bigger sibling of each model of phone since the iPhone 6 is a love it or hate it device. There was initially a massive sales boost from those that looked at larger screened Android device with envy. Yet as bezels slimmed and handset footprints declined, the Plus was still a hulking great device. Apple gave the Plus a further selling point by upgrading the camera to a duel lens system with the iPhone 7, but adoption still slowed.</p>
<p>Since even before the iPhone 7, rumours have pointed to Apple ridding users of the home button and filling the device with screen. Many users waited with baited breath for Cupertino to deliver this promice. Thought it was another year before they released a redesigned and truly modern iPhone.</p>
<p>Even though the<a href="/post/2017-11-08-iphonex-impressions/"> iPhone X is a truly great handset</a>, there is still a massive case for users to buy a Plus model iPhone instead. Infact, bar the OIS fitted to the zoom lens, the iPhone 8 Plus is pretty much the same as the much more expensive iPhone X. Users that previously used a Plus device stand to miss out on a much wider and spaced out keyboard, and many landscape features.</p>
<p>Compared to its regular sized sibling, the usable screen size is much taller – but compared to the Plus model many users are going to be disappointed. It goes without saying that the taller aspect ratio is easier to hold but at the cost of a much larger typing space on the keyboard and well spaced out websites and apps.</p>
<p>There is no denying the Plus model phones are huge when compared to most modern handsets. However Apples insistence on using a wider screen won its self millions of fans. Unfortunately hanging onto a dated design a little too long may have lots it many more.</p>
<p>The iPhone. X is a brilliant mix of modern design, bigger screen and smaller bezels – but there is still a massive argument for using an iPhone 8 Plus. Don’t be swayed by marketing and Social Media hype. The iPhone Plus may just be better suited to you.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>As you may or may not know I don’t bother <a href="/post/2017-07-07-ipad-pro-initial-impressions/">writing reviews anymore</a>. There are hundreds of great videos and long form pieces out there to satiate your appetite for that kind of thing. However I usually share my initial thoughts on using new devices – and here are mine on the iPhone X.</p>
<p>This unwillingness to spend hours wiring a full review is further exaggerated by the hype surrounding Apples new device. There isn’t much to write that hasn’t already been covered in one way or another. The hardware is top notch see what I did there) but I didn’t expect anything less. Apple’s design <a href="/post/2017-10-06-apple-design-failing/">compromises and hardware choices</a> may be questionable now, but their ability to <a href="/post/2017-11-06-apples-service-advantage/">make a customer feel</a> happy they are spending lots of money is undeniable.</p>
<p>The phone itself is another step forward in quality feel from previous iPhones. The use of polished metal and glass makes for an extremely premium feeling device. Anyone that handles it will feel like they are touching a thousand pounds worth of device. Using these materials does have a trade off in weight, the iPhone X is noticeably heavier than similar devices, this is without doubt a reassuring feel but it hurts my pinky when adopting my usual grip.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="iphone-x-notes-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8a4ce78c61.jpg" alt="Iphone x notes 1" width="600" height="300" border="0" /></p>
<h1><strong>Screen</strong></h1>
<p>The 5.8” OLED display dominates the front of the phone, this is no more obvious than when first powering on the phone. The white screen of the setup screen creates wonder and intrigue from the very first second. Combine this with the boost in resolution to 2436×1125-pixel resolution at 458ppi and the True Tone technology you have a device that not only looks but feels like the future.</p>
<p>Of course it isn’t, this is Apple playing catch up to the Galaxy S series but for an Apple user the brightness of an OLED that keeps the Apple colour accuracy tremendously improves the experience. Even in bright sunshine the screen is bright and easy to view.</p>
<p>The usable area of the handset is going to frustrate users coming from a iPhone Plus model, the keyboard does not have the space that the wider handset provides. Although I have found the device fantastic to use, I often write on my phone and have found it a much better experience than my previous regular sized iPhone 7. Apps and webpages are much more suited to a taller display, meaning the keyboard is a little taller and raised slightly towards the middle of the phone than previous models.</p>
<p>There is without doubt a blue shift when looking at the screen at very acute angles, it remains to be seen about burn in – but these are just the ofset things about OLED screens. The screen is stunning in every situation and the notch disappears almost instantly and is a complete non issue.</p>
<h1><strong>True Depth And FaceID</strong></h1>
<p>The notch allows for one of the most controversial features of the new phone, FaceID. By removing the home button and going all in on FaceID Apple have changed the way you use your phone. I am not a massive fan of this shift in authentication however it has meant that being more secure has faded into the background. It has worked flawlessly for me, all meant that I no longer have to think about pasting in passwords from 1 Password or entering secure apps.</p>
<p>As stared of for this, using the device flat on a table is slightly more awkward, and holding the device pointing at your face needs to become a habit. Going forward I have no doubt that this will improve, however as it stands right now it is absolutely fine.</p>
<p>The true depth camera has also allowed for portrait selfies, which works as described and also animating your very own emoji. Animoji is a unsurprising hit, if a little annoying for those that don’t have an iPhone X. I have no doubt this fad will run out of steam, but at the moment it is a enjoyable way to communicate.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="iPhone-X-Camera-portrait-1-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bb3d6b9491.jpg" alt="IPhone X Camera portrait 1 1" width="599" height="334" border="0" /></p>
<h1><strong>Camera</strong></h1>
<p>I wouldn’t go so far as to say I am disappointed in the camera, but it doesn’t offer anything over the camera on the iPhone 8 Plus. It does feature OIS on both of the lenses but I am yet to see any benefit to this. Zoomed images are still noisy and fail to capture quite a few snaps I have tried. I still default to using the wider lens and getting a bit closer, which is a real shame.</p>
<p>Focus also takes quite a long time to action, I feel the camera app itself is not intelligent enough for a modern smartphone and wonder if it is trying to do too much before taking a snap. Perhaps adopting an post processing model would make the experience better – and for the love of god please do something with the increased screen size!</p>
<p>Not even a week since getting the phone I would say I am very pleased with the phone overall. It doesn’t change the way the phone is used, bar the new gesture based navigation. This still takes a little too much brain power to remember, however this must remove ten years of muscle memory so I have no doubt it will sink in soon and feel natural.</p>
<p>Fundamentally it is still an iPhone and those that are Android users are not going to be attracted. However Apple have caught up to the pack now and sell a modern smartphone. For someone so on the fence about buying the phone I am very glad I did. I am not sure those that purchase their phone outright and have a modern iPhone should rush to upgrade, however if your in the market for an upgrade look no further than the X.</p>

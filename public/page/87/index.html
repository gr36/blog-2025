<blockquote><p>No user in their right consciousness would look to opt-in for personalised ads considering its used for monetisation purposes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Quite often there is a push back, usually from people regarding Google, that they would rather see relevant ads than random ones. Whilst this could be true, the ad tracking and data storage doesn’t just stop with seeing more relevant ads, its tracks everything about you for no good purpose.</p>
<p>Personalised ads should be viewed as manipulation, and unfortunately most people just don’t join the dots. Whilst the statement above is a bit bold, as I think most people just taps yes because they don’t care – they really should start caring.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>That crusade is as vulnerable to mistakes and excesses as any other struggle against abstract evils. Some of the most zealous crusaders are demanding affirmations of solidarity and punishing mild dissent. Institutions are imposing draconian punishments for minor transgressions. Individuals are scapegoated for structural ills. There are efforts to get people fired, including even some who share the desire for racial justice.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I will preface this by saying that some transgressions are simply unacceptable, and deserve no understanding. However currently, whenever I see people being shamed for holding an alternative view point and ‘pilled on’ by social media I think about the stories in Jon Ronson’s excellent book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/So-Youve-Been-Publicly-Shamed-ebook/dp/B0196HJ6OS/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=56190338627&amp;dchild=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwjLD4BRAiEiwAg5NBFsuOgr1VHgrOgwUp296WSDbNd6tzQCcjfpYeNPEsx8q3wzDmteFrxxoCSMgQAvD_BwE&amp;hvadid=259084702764&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1006745&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=1814641648316723248&amp;hvtargid=kwd-304224817332&amp;hydadcr=10833_1789925&amp;keywords=so+you%27ve+been+publicly+shamed&amp;qid=1594634320&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=googhydr-21">So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed</a>.</p>
<p>This is full of stories that were once the outrage of the internet, and are now looked back on with embarrassment. i think we will look back on people like David Shor and institutions like The Tattered Cover with the same remorse.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When I think about <a href="https://gr36.com/stop-wearing-my-watch/">ditching my Apple Watch</a> after five years of faithful usage, I can only ever get about 90% there. The easy part is working out how I am going to use my phone and finding ways to stay connected only when needed and remove it entirely when I wish to switch off. Unfortunately that last few tweaks to my usage never fall into place.</p>
<p>There is one pretty big issues that I am not sure I can find a way around yet, it’s caused all sorts of headaches and stress already. I cant for the life of me work out how any one manages notifications without an Apple Watch.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time I have thought about my notifications and <a href="https://gr36.com/notifications-haze/">managing them</a>. It’s been a struggle since climbing up the corporate ladder — emails pinging at all times of the day and night. Factor in loads of apps that want your attention, and it could soon become a nightmare.</p>
<p>I love the peace and quiet, I love not having a tan mark on my arm, and I love the fact that I have one less bit of tech to manage. I just don’t know how anyone puts up with dings and phone ringtones in their life.</p>
<p>From the first time I put on my Apple Watch I don’t think my phone has been switched off silent. The Apple Watch allows me to be notified about what I want to show up, but with a subtle tap on the wrist. No buzzing, no dings and much less stress. I can often action it right then and there, without even needing to pick up my phone — I am actually getting comfortable answering the odd phone call from the Apple Watch too.</p>
<p>How on earth people manage notifications I really don’t know. For the longest time I have turned everything off but messages, phone calls and emails from VIPs and it’s still too much without a watch to screen everything. So for now, the Apple Watch remains attached to me like a life jacket, there to stop me downing in noise.</p>

<blockquote><p>Sixteen marketing associations, some of which are backed by Facebook Inc (<a href="https://uk.reuters.com/companies/FB.O">FB.O</a>) and Alphabet Inc’s (<a href="https://uk.reuters.com/companies/GOOGL.O">GOOGL.O</a>) Google, faulted Apple for not adhering to an ad-industry system for seeking user consent under European privacy rules. Apps will now need to ask for permission twice, increasing the risk users will refuse, the associations argued.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course they are kicking up a fuss. All of their shady tactics, designed to circumnavigate user permissions are being shut down one by one.</p>
<p>Marketing companies have been offered use of Apple tools to make sure ad targeting is working and numbers are reported well. This uses anonymous aggregated data – but this still isn’t enough. The tool is “engineered to not track users, there’s no need to request permission to track,” Brandon Van Ryswyk, an Apple privacy engineer,</p>
<p>These companies want access to user specific data and clear tracking of clearly defined individuals. These are not marketing businesses, they are spying on you and have made it looks like advertising.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>I would hope that no body starts morning that I am not writing about enough technology lately, but I’m finding it hard to write about anything at all. Never mind getting motivated to write about the very little news going around. I have been spending my time <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/cycling/">riding my bike when</a> weather allows, but when the bad weather comes I have to take it inside to the virtual playground of <a href="https://zwift.com/athlete/7b4045fa-cc88-4e49-92b4-f871e8811ef4">Zwift</a>.</p>
<p>Writing recently in <a href="https://gr36.com/gtt-9/">my newsletter</a> I covered my love of the cycling (and running) platform and trying to gamify my cycling as much as possible. I’m still in the very early stages but having just crossed into level 11, my aim is to complete as many of the available routes as possible. Unfortunately Zwift is not great at this, and although the information is obtainable, it’s not easy to work with. So I spent some time building a way to track it.</p>
<p><br /><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8335452151565777" data-ad-slot="5524743860"></ins></p>
<p>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</p>
<p>There are loads of posts discussing several online and offline manual methods plotting out distances, XP points and the dreaded hilly bits. Thankfully a huge amount of data exists about each route, because so many people have ridden them. While looking for ways to automate this I stumbled on some spreadsheet methods on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zwift/comments/eqles5/i_made_a_complete_list_of_the_zwift_route_badges/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">Reddit</a>, and put together my own version combining several of them.</p>
<p>It’s dead easy to use, most routes link to information about the route you will take and the world used. The spreadsheet itself outlines distance covered (KM) and distance claimed (M) during the route, as well as the XP you will be rewarded for completing it. After a few weeks I am only at 12 % due to better weather currently, but I have done some of the worst – <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/route/road-to-sky/">Road to Sky</a> up Alpe Du Zwift, and <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/route/mountain-8/">Mountain 8</a> up the Epic KOM I particularly hated.</p>

      <p>Something that I am constantly thinking about is broadening my horizons and appreciating other peoples interests and points of view. Something that is actually quite difficult to do, as it seems we are preprogrammed to believe our own points of view above all else and defend our positions. So, some of this is understandable, but we owe it to ourselves and others around us to be better people.</p></p>
<p>I don’t believe that anything in life is binary, it can be not completely good or bad. You can find positives in everything, and if 2020 has taught me anything, it is that there a whole load of people I once respected that live in a bubble of their choice. Many fail to see that their experiences are not what others have felt and share some disgusting opinions online.</p>
<p>I am talking disputing systematic racism levels of idiocy. View points that will affect others should be questioned as much as possible and living in a bubble of your mind won’t help you do this. I urge everyone reading my newsletter to breakout of your normal and experience other peoples view points and beliefs. Certainly challenge them, but spend time learning why and how they have come to this view point — you just might learn a thing or two.</p>
<p>On the plus side, I follow a few less people on Twitter now.</p>

<p>For the past year, I have been running my blog on the <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost platform</a>. It gave me the ability to have a site as fast as the static one I used to have, but with a much more powerful CMS behind it. When first testing it out and setting up memberships I knew this platform would be for me.</p>
<p>It allows me to keep control of everything from payments to blog posts, and send emails to you all at the push of a button.</p>
<p>Lately though it has been suffering from poor updates that have affected the site structure and inner workings. Updates have been released and then having to be patched a few hours latter due to some bug or another. Unfortunately the 3.22 update removed all the sites menus and emails settings, with a fix not easy to achieve.</p>
<p>This time I had made a snapshot of my server before updating, but this was just dumb luck not great planning. Having had to resort to the support forums for a few days running I have run out of patience with the lacklustre testing going on. I don’t want to bad mouth developers doing their best, but updates to the blog will be few and far between for the time being, until I can be confident these kinds of issues are sorted.</p>
<p>I don’t see myself switching anywhere else, but its times like these when a Mailchimp email and a WordPress blog seem like some welcome, if a little boring, tech resilience.</p>

<blockquote><p>The irony is that the people we’re most likely to want to trust and engage with are the ones who don’t pose. They’re consistent, committed and clear, but they’re not faking it. – <a href="https://seths.blog/2020/08/posing-for-selfies/">Seth Godin</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I seriously doubt Seth reads my newsletter but this post seems to tug on the things that I was approaching last edition. The apparent rise and rise of taking pictures just to show off what you are doing, or rather doing things just so you can pose for photos.</p>
<p>This isn’t new information but those people online you flex your ego to are not your real friends, those likes you get doesn’t mean they like you — the people around you are your friends. They know the real you, who you actually are and they see the difference in who you are on social media. Put the phone down and enjoy those people instead of showing off to people online.</p>

<blockquote><p>Google, on the other hand, takes a different approach. Google literally stores exactly where you are, where you have been, and even the route you took. And, it saves that data. Sure, you could go in and delete the information Google has stored, if you happened to know how or where it was located. In reality, very few people did that.</p></blockquote>
<p>The minimal approach has its benifits, but also its downsides. When better results come from Google having more data – most people opt for that.</p>
<p>You be forgiven for thinking that people outside of the tech bubble care about their personal data to a level that these types of posts do. The worry fact is they don’t. Bilions of people still use Facebook.</p>
<p>Google has its place, and it is at the heart of most peoples internet – and that’s not going to change.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Nothing can ever be perfect, and Hey is no different. It takes some thought to get used to all the features, but there are some things that I would really like to see implemented in the near future. I have every confidence the service will be imported following feedback, so investment in this is well worth it in my opinion. Heres some things that I would like and ideas about how they could work.</p>
<h2>Import of Mbox</h2>
<p>This is a biggie, and almost the one that put me off switching over. I really would like to see the ability to import all my old email, so I can be done with gmail forever. There are emails, files and all sorts fo information I am almost constantly referring back to, so I really need to only rely on once service.</p>
<p>Hey allows you to export your email in the mbox format, so I would really love to see them allow it the other way. This would allow me to set up my filters better than ever. This would put strain on their storage and servers though, and I do understand that they want you to have a fresh new start.</p>
<h2>Smarter Notifications</h2>
<p>As it stands currently there is no way for me to know that there are emails in My Feed or Paper Trail. I am currently checking periodically and it’s a bit of a pain. I completely understand that these types of emails are supposed to be out of sight, but some notification would be great.</p>
<p>Currently, I can turn notifications on for some emails that go into the feed, such as my <a href="https://gr36.com/signup/">wonderful newsletter</a> but I think it is too much work to filter these. Being able to set notification or notification levels would be the perfect balance. Perhaps I don’t want a push notification, but a discrete banner to let me know my bill has arrived such as below.</p>
<h2>Navigation Improvements</h2>
<p>The team need to improve the way to get from Imbox to Paper Trail and The Feed particularly on mobile. Currently, you must tap on the Hey button, tap the area you wish to go to. This isn’t too much hassle, but when you wish to go to the next area, swiping back and the repeating the process becomes tiresome.</p>
<p>A tabbed menu at the bottom would be too much and defeat the whole purpose of putting marketing emails and receipts out the way, so some thought around this is needed.</p>
<h2>The Feed</h2>
<p>Newsletters are my thing. Reading them in Hey is great as they are all filtered out, bar a few marketing emails mixed in that I still want to see. However, What about them disappearing from the feed completely when I have read them?</p>
<p>Currently, the feed displays everything that has arrived with nothing to say you’ve seen it before. A small notification for some that I like reading straight away would also be a helpful addition.</p>
<p>There you have it. Not many things that I haven’t got my head around and made Hey my email service of choice. I would really like to see the mbox import if all else fails. Just so I can finally move over completely. 🙏</p>

  That made me think, if money isn’t going to be a significant factor in any decision, and I have no desire to write for a specific audience, then I may as well just write for myself. Then if people like what I write about, then great, and if not then it doesn’t particularly matter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been banging on about this for a while, but not taking my own advice (I’m good at that). Still trying to <a href="https://gr36.com/asking-giving-and-blogging/">build something that works</a>, still seeking those numbers. When in reality it’s not what I want.</p>
<p>If growth is your game, <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://ljpuk.net/2021/02/15/do-you-need-to-find-your-blogs-niche/">find your niche</a> and do that, but it seems like a pretty boring writing life to me. I’d rather write what I want, when I want and not worry about it.</p>

  Next up is figuring out an angle to talk about this machine, because it’s great and I want to shout about it from the rooftops.</p>
<p>  I’m going to use it a bit more than normal over the next week or so because it’s new and shiny. Maybe I’ll leave my iPad for good because of how good it is…but that’s not likely 😛
</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt does these posts every now and again that sum up why he’s done something. And at first glance this post seems like a bash the iPad post. But it does a great job of summing up the reasons for using a Mac – and I agree with all of them.</p>
<p>While the iPad can do a lot of great things, editing video is not one of them. Lumia fusion is ok, but missing so many things that both speed up workflow and make editing much easier. If you make an iPad app you must cater to touch input and that doesn’t work all the time, especially when you have complex features and menus 2&gt;3 levels deep.</p>
<p>I can see a world where iOS and Mac have a lot of cross over but distinctive traits that make them great at specific things. Theres still something holding the iPad back for some things and that’s ok. Let’s not squeeze things into holes they are not designed to fill, but embrace them because of what they are made for.</p>

     <p>After <a href="/2018/01/20/using-microblog-aka.html">trying</a> and <a href="/2019/12/15/bye-microblog.html">failing</a> several times, I am starting to move <a href="/2021/02/04/digital-social-distancing.html">further and further away</a> from Twitter. I still check in every once in a while, but a good long break is helping to stop my impulses and <a href="https://gr36.com/twitter-muscle-memory/">curb my impusive usage</a>.</p><p>I don’t hate Twitter, far from it, I love it, I just want it to do more than it does. It offers a platform that has barely moved forward for years, and just isn’t <a href="/2021/01/11/social-media-in.html">powerful enough for the modern web</a>. So I still cross post everything to Twitter and visit perhaps once or twice a day to check my mentions. I might even scroll through if I am feeling particularly interested and see what is going on, but in the main part I stay away a lot more than I did.</p><p>Which has gotten me thinking about where it fits in and the image I want to portray. I deleted my <a href="/2017/11/12/i-finally-deletedfacebook.html">Facebook account fully in 2017</a> after months of not using it because I didn’t want to appear like I was Ghosting people and this situation feels remarkably similar. I am sure people understand that a blog post is probably auto posted, but my micro.blog posts appears as if I have posted them myself and slow or no replies seem a bit rude.</p><p>One of the reasons I love <a href="">micro.blog</a> is because it is so slow. It is based around stopping, thinking, and writing a response properly. Taking a <a href="https://ljpuk.net/2021/02/11/take-a-breath-before-you-post/">breather before you tweet</a> is an important lesson, but one very rarely taken. So Twitter sometimes feels like a whole network built on “this is why you’re wrong” when in reality it is just the fast paced nature of the platform.</p><p>Twitters whole deal is instant, always on connection constantly being updated. So, slow replies don’t fit in here. I don’t want to appear rude, and I certainly don’t want to cut it off completely, but you may not get many replies from me anymore, and I hope that is ok.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>There are numerous things that I cannot remember when and why I started doing, I just do. But running I know exactly when and why. I was in my second year of secondary school, and we were doing cross country. I’d never been a highly active kid, but it was a nice day, and I couldn’t be bothered to walk it like the ‘cool’ kids did, so I ran.</p>
<p>Turns out I quite enjoyed it, and despite what half the school would tell you, it was lots of fun. Even more shocking to me was that I was actually rather good at it too. That was the day I started to run, and it improved that day tremendously. I went to my next class with a big smile on my face. To this day I’ve never stopped.</p>
<p>I ran at first because it made me feel good. I got faster and people started pushing me faster still. I started to run races, and win medals, and the pushing never stopped. Very quickly I became to hate running, because it was no longer enjoyable, it was a chore and one I had to do at set times, distances, and speeds.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I no longer run for gold anymore, but I still run. Most days I lace up my trainers and go out for a run, and the benefits to me are huge. Getting my blood pumping, clearing my lungs and my mind and making me feel so much better. I don’t focus on running every fast, and don’t set out to even cover certain distances I just go out and see what happens. Despite <a href="https://gr36.com/injured-best-thing-health/">discovering cycling last summer</a>, nothing has ever replaced the feeling I get from running. It has become part of me, just something I do.</p>
<p>People do ask, but I never have to ask myself why I run. The answer is because I love it.</p>

  The crux of having other significant others (as coined by psychologist Eli Finkel) is to have your needs met from more than just your romantic partner. Your partner cannot always meet all your needs even if you expect them to. So, these are the people who would go along with you to exercise or listen to you vent about things your partner isn’t interested in hearing.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is some of my issue and why I keep a lot of things to myself. I do not want to burden my wife with my problems, but have no real significant others the share things with.</p>
<p>There are people that <a href="https://gr36.com/reaching-out/">reach out</a>, and I am very grateful for this. But how personal do you get with people before feeling embarrassed? Looking back I’m not sure I’ve ever had friends close enough to share my frustrations and worries with. That’s pretty weird isn’t it?</p>

While average users are definitely becoming more aware of the issues surrounding some companies, look at the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/whatsapp-flap-shows-importance-of-message-platform-to-facebook/articleshow/80874101.cms">uproar directed towards a fairly mundane policy update</a> for WhatsApp. Users are still using Facebook in their billions despite all of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">issues</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-civic-groups-internal-docs-capitol-riot-misinformation-hate-2021-2?r=US&amp;IR=T">surrounding</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">them</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444205/mark-in-the-middle">during</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/20/21375381/facebook-qanon-purge-content-policy-tide-pods">the last</a> few years.</p>
<p>So, silly me, was expecting a clear and concise sum up of the app you are looking to download. For it to be displayed clearly. Allowing the user to know exactly what they are going to install on their phone.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/dcfccef7e5.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>What we actually got feels like a token gesture to use as a signal to their customers they are fighting for you. Yet it is buried away at the bottom of the listing, underneath the rest of the information that no body reads. They might as well have put it in the terms and conditions of their devices because it stands about as much chance of being read.</p>
<p>This half step, which took an age to make, is frankly pretty pointless. I struggle to understand why the big companies kicked off so much in the first place. Most of them have been allowed to get away with pretty much whatever they like anyway. Remember Facebook <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/the-background-data-and-battery-usage-of-facebooks-ios-app/">playing silent audio</a> because of a ‘bug’? Or using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">enterprise certificates</a> to get more data on users, with very little recourse. Remember <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16343304/uber-location-tracking-opt-out-apple-ios11">Uber tracking the hell</a> out of pretty much every iOS user? Apple clearly needed to make a change, but this pathetic attempt is more PR than a privacy upgrade.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am missing something, perhaps there is more going on behind closed doors and we are getting a privacy upgrade, but these labels will make pretty much zero difference, and I can’t understand why it stopped <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/12/google-youtube-iphone-update/">Google updating it’s apps</a> at all.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Facebook states that choosing between tracking users for personalized ads and protecting their privacy is a “false-trade off,” claiming that it believes it can provide both.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Why are you not providing it then 🤦‍♂️.</p>
<p>This par spin Facebook puts on its actions and the attempts to curb its control are getting laughable. We all know what Facebook is like, we all know their company is run by some one letting his ego run a mock, yet they try and spin the story every time.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg has a tendency to lash out when provoked so it will be interesting to see what happens. I can’t think of much they can do to harm Apple though?</p>

     <p>After reading some other bloggers writing workflows and even looking at some diagrams to illustrate them that I realised how simple my own is. One thing I definitely don’t want to be worrying about is where my posts go, and wondering what to do next — but I guess I’m a pretty simple guy!</p>
<p>In fact just looking at the graphic on <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/02/01/our-secret-optimizing.html">Numeric Citizens</a> post makes me stare in amazement. I cont even keep up with having more than one notes app, never mind about publishing to more than one or two websites. I take my hat off to him, but I love having one avenue to worry about my words going to and then in syndicate everywhere.</p>
<p>I am interested in what goes where and why, as if anyone has a method to this madness it’s JFM.</p>

     <p>I’ve kept reasonably quiet about Stadia, and it’s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-02-01-google-shutting-down-internal-stadia-studios-offering-streaming-tech-to-publishers">predicted demise</a>. Partly because I can’t be doing with the hassle and moaning, and partly because I am not that motivated that I want to argue the case for a huge corporation. However, since I first started playing on it a couple of months ago it has been a revelation.</p><p>It started out as a way of me feeling in with the crowd <a href="https://gr36.com/non-gamers-guide-google-stadia/">and playing Cyberpunk 2077</a> but has become a valuable way of my unwinding and catching up on all the gaming I have missed out on for the past few years. I’ve had a Switch on and off since launch but never got as in depth into playing as I am now. For some reason being able to pick up my controller and play on my phone, iPad, or on my TV whatever the situation really fits into my life.</p><p>I get next-gen graphics for a fraction of the price, and I’m loving almost everything about it. There are a few stutters sometimes, and not all the games I want to play are on it (hurry up FIFA 21) but the downsides are compromises I am willing to make. There are more and more games launching all the time, and my only criticism is related to all digital games — they are overly expensive!</p><p>Like I said, this isn’t an argument for Stadia, I have no strong feelings either way. You might have other views about it, that’s cool too. This is just my thoughts on me being able to play something that fits into my life. My enjoyment of playing has increased and instead of spending money on tech I seem to be bankrupting myself buying games!</p><p>If it goes away, I will be sad, but I’m not about to argue with you why you think it sucks. You do you, I’ll carry on playing Stadia. 🎮</p>

     <p>Last night, just before heading up to bed I published a blog post. Not an exceptionally long one, but something that <a href="/2021/02/10/reaching-out.html">I wanted to share</a> and hopefully inspire others. Rushing it out, hitting publish just before I turned everything off for the night.</p><p>Despite settling down and reading my kind for a while and enjoying a peaceful house my brain started to wonder what feedback I had gained on my post. But you know it’s getting late, dark outside and I am quite enjoying this <a href="https://micro.blog/books/0316457426?title=The+Coast-to-Coast+Murders&author=James+Patterson&isbn=0316457426">James Patterson book</a> so I try and put it out of my mind. It’s still there though, the need to check what’s going on. This is a feeling I have been paying attention to recently due to my years of ingrained <a href="/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html">Twitter muscle memory</a>.</p><p>It’s more than a fear of missing out and seems to run deeper into my brain than I care to admit. Soon becoming apparent that I can’t shake this itch in my brain and need to see what’s going on. So I put my Kindle down, pick up my phone and bounce around on Twitter and micro.blog annoyed at myself.</p><p>Of course nothing is happening other than a couple of likes, but even if there was I shouldn’t be reading it at this time of night anyway. My need for feedback is now messing up my sleep pattern as well as beginning to stress me out. It seems I am surprisingly good at giving out advice to others, but not very good at keeping it myself. When it comes to social media, it’s got me right where it wants me. Not only am I checking it every bored moment, but I am also checking it for feedback.</p><p>I wouldn’t say that I was doing it to inflate my ego, this wasn’t that kind of posts, but I wanted to see if others thought the same. To see if I could provoke others to do something kind, so I’ve already got a kind of excuse sorted in my mind. The fact remains that social media is taking a much larger role in my current life and I don’t like it!</p>

     <p>Perhaps I have listened to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/modern-wisdom/id1347973549?i=1000637768699">too many bro-podcasts</a> over the last few days, but I am led to believe that a massive fear of failure exists in people. I fail at so many things that perhaps I am desensitised to the whole experience, but there is absolutely nothing to fear from not getting the result you wanted.</p>
<p>I should preface this with a warning about taking unneeded risks and not ruining things that make huge changes to your life — but outside this, fail hard and often. Failure is the way you find out what suits you best. It’s the way to round off the corners of all the square things you find to make sure something fits as you need it to. As Alain de Botton <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success">elegantly put it</a> “It’s bad enough not getting what you want, but it’s even worse getting to the end and realising it isn’t what you wanted”.</p>
<img src="uploads/2024/d03f197ae4.jpg" alt="" />
<p>How on earth do you even know what you want without failing at a million things first? I’ve tried <a href="/2023/11/22/my-big-flip.html">Flip phones</a>, and <a href="/2022/12/31/i-really-want.html">journals</a>, notebooks, and hundreds of other things. All which fell flat on their face, and from the failure I learnt lessons, and improved the way my life works.</p>
<p>None of these things I pointed out above matter, it’s easy to fail at these things. Don’t even get me started on the declined job applications, rebuffed dating advances and miserable attempts at being a writer. A<a href="/2022/01/06/it-depends-on.html">t the time some of them seemed like world ending events</a>, but I learnt things, I worked out what I wanted and and moved forward. </p>
<p>In many way I learnt how to fail and now I will never shy away from trying new things. Exploring my thoughts around subjects. Working out a millions ways to do a job before I dive in. Throwing a high percentage of draft blog posts into the bin. There is nothing wrong with any of these things, it is the not doing part that sucks. The wondering what if, or the missed opportunity because fear froze you. That sucks, failure doesn’t. </p>

     <p>If you’ve read more than 2 of my blog posts, you will know <a href="/2021/04/16/back-as-far.html">I yearn for a simpler time</a>. A time pre-smartphone, where everything didn’t rely on my having a computer in my pocket — whilst also loving technology. There is no getting away from the feelings, but I have become to realise that if you are not paying attention, how ridiculous the pursuit of less can become.</p>
<p>One of my favourite sub-Reddits is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbphones/">r/dumbphones</a>, it is wonderful to see the phones people are still using and the ones available if you look hard enough. From old school Nokia remakes to <a href="https://www.catphones.com/en-us/cat-s22-flip/">mixes of flip phone keypads and Android</a>. One of the post tends recently has been everyday carries, and seeing people using a flip phone and a notepad gives me hope. Then I see others lugging around a dumb phone, MP3 player, camera, kindle, and even more things — and that brings me back to reality.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3b998d1faa.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This was one of the reasons I failed my flip phone experiment. At some point, you just have to realise that all this stuff is a bit ridiculous. This is no slight against the person posting in the screenshot above, it is more a revelation for me. The reason smartphones caught on so quickly is they cannibalised all of these extra things we used to carry around. They made our life easier, and going backwards is not always the way.</p>
<p>By having a smartphone in my pocket, am I actually making my life simpler. I have in my pocket a camera, kindle, music player, writing device and much more. There is a lot to be said for <a href="/2019/12/17/intentional-barriers.html">intentional barriers</a> but carrying around all of these extra things doesn’t simplify anything. It just adds complexity. To carry on using a flip phone, past the week or so I managed, I would need to buy more devices when I can just exercise some self-control.</p>
<p>Which indeed is easier said than done, but it’s something to think about. I’m not completely convinced by <a href="https://stolenfocusbook.com/audio/">Nir Eyal and his insistence that destruction is our personal fault</a>, but I must take some responsibility. The solution is often not a worse experience, it is just to use the tool you have, well.</p>

     <p>There’s a line I hear a lot when people get preachy about being online too much or using social media. “When you’re on your deathbed, you will wish you weren’t on your phone so much” or some paraphrase of this is reeled off again and again. Mainly because it’s probably true. I’ve written before <a href="/2022/09/21/this-might-be.html">about longing for the things you hate when they’ve gone,</a> and it often causes me to pause and think about my blog.</p>
<p>Should I lie on this hypothetical deathbed, hopefully decades from now, what will I wish I had done differently? I won’t wish I spent less time on social media, I met most of the people to interact with there, well maybe I should have shaved a few months to a year off my usage towards the end. I would definitely wish I posted more to my blog though, it doesn’t feel like wasted time regardless of the external results.</p>
<p>Publishing here feels like I am at least trying to leave something behind. I’m not lucky enough to be good enough to write a book, so I guess this is the next best thing. It is my only wish that should I pass on, it stays behind as my one and only legacy, a side from my kids, of course. I’m not a big blogger. I don’t get thousands of ‘hits’ and you could be reading this thinking what on earth does this rubbish need to stay alive for. I’d tend to agree, it’s just something I think about.</p>
<p>I love writing, publishing, and interacting with people about my thoughts and ideas. Many of them are formed, flexed and even broken through online discourse and I value all the time and effort it takes. <a href="https://lili.bearblog.dev/if-writing-changes-me-let-it-change-me-for-the-better/">Writing changes you</a>, it helps form ideas, and I find so much about myself just by typing out my internal monologue. So much so that when the time does come to cross the rainbow bridge I think I would miss it most of all.</p>
<p>These thoughts bring me to thinking about the discoverability of my writing. Not in an SEO way, but the people I care about being able to read the things I think about and the thoughts that are important to me. I want people to be able to flick through the pages of my journals and take something from them. If my son ever thinks “what would dad do” I want him to be able to find out. To search through my blog posts and have me talk to him.</p>
<p>The morbidness of this train of thought is not lost on me. I don’t think others in my position have these desires. But when I am gone, I want to still be around.</p>

<p>Do I want to be a blogger? Am I already a blogger? Why can&rsquo;t I seem to spell simple words correctly? Do others worry about the amount of things I worry about?</p></blockquote>
<p>I still think about these things. I feel like reverting back to a blank page and a free ‘blog’. Everything else seems pointless.</p>

     <p>Have you ever developed new habits or changed existing ones without realising it? There isn’t an abrupt shift, but rather a gradual evolution in your subconscious mind. You suddenly &lsquo;wake up&rsquo; to this change with a sense of surprise. This realisation hit me today when I went for my daily walk with my dog and my headphones died. I&rsquo;m not even sure when I began to wear them for my walks, but their sudden absence made me acutely aware of my new routine.</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my walk today. There’s something special about the slight chill in the air paired with the warmth of the sun that I find delightful. It&rsquo;s an odd time of year when you need both a hat and gloves as well as sunglasses, but I think it&rsquo;s the perfect balance. That might seem like a tangent, but perhaps being alone with my thoughts allowed me to appreciate it more. Unwittingly, I had been walking with my AirPods for the last few days, listening to podcasts or audiobooks, which meant I was never truly alone.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s nothing inherently wrong with listening to something while walking. However, I find that excessive consumption of content prevents me from fully developing my own ideas. The ideas I do have, influenced by various media, never seem to fully materialise or reach a conclusion if there’s a constant influx of new ones. Podcasts, in particular, tend to spark new thoughts or introduce intriguing topics, but I <em>need</em> those interludes of silence to explore and expand on them before moving on to the next.</p>
<p>There are already numerous thoughts occupying space in my mind, most of which I tend to overanalyse, without the addition of new ones pouring in. That is why <a href="/2021/03/14/the-importance-of.html">I value silence</a> and downtime so much. It enables me to read a book, jot down notes, or just <a href="/2023/09/09/i-enjoy-being.html">embrace a slower pace</a>, which in turn allows me to operate at full capacity when necessary. However, this doesn&rsquo;t make it any easier when <a href="https://wheresyoured.at/p/sam-altman-freed">a company I am interested in implodes</a> over the course of a week leading to an influx of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/podcasts/hard-fork-altman-openai-rehired.html">emergency podcasts</a>!</p>
<p>Over the years, I have learned to appreciate the uncomfortable sensation of boredom and not to shun it. I see many people who cannot stand to be unoccupied, and I believe that being comfortable with boredom is an important skill for self-discovery. The desire for constant entertainment is pervasive and seems problematic. As I discovered today, despite the world being filled with distractions, sometimes all I really need is silence.</p>

     <p>I have been trying to write this post for a very long time. Trying to outline my <a href="/2023/08/23/my-big-flip.html">experiment of using a flip phone again</a> because it is the culmination of a few years of wanting to try it, knowing I can’t and then slowly walking myself back from the edge. This time my wife pushed me over the edge with words along the line of “stop talking about it and do it” with comical results and some realisations along the way.</p>
<p>I say this with the knowledge that I have written and rewritten this post quite a few times. I hoped that my thoughts would come easily as they are plentiful, but my fear was that they could be judged as more than a little preachy. This would have destroyed the message behind this post and removed any hope of people reading it. So I hope this version finds the right spot in your motivation to keep reading. It circles a realisation I had about a week into the experiment and applies to numerous things in tech circles.</p>
<p>On the first boot of my sim being in a new Nokia 2660, I hit barriers. The phone cost me a whopping £25 from a local business and ticked all the boxes I wanted it to tick, but the barriers came from other places. There is no way to transfer contacts over, so I had to spend quite a bit of time doing the new phone dance that people of a certain age will remember. Typing all the numbers and contact names in on the t9 keypad, that after ten minutes, made my hand cramp. I used to be able to send a text without even looking, and although some muscle memory remained, the dexterity to do so did not.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/be322f6dde.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Once this was done, I put the phone down and stared at it. You see, the great thing about a dumb phone, although this particular model <em>did</em> have Facebook installed, is that there is nothing to do with it. Outside the occasional game of snake, unless the phone beeped, or I needed to contact someone, it never moved from the table in my kitchen. For something to do, I even when and connected it to my car&rsquo;s bluetooth, which went about as easily as any other phone I have used. Which was frustrating because I expected to hit more annoyances than this. How dare this ridiculous phone be easy to use and peaceful.</p>
<p>Truth be told, for the first couple of days, I wished we had never moved past this stage in the mobile phone evolution. I wanted to stay with this device that asked absolutely nothing from me. It delivered on everything it promises, which is next to nothing, and that was one with me. That&rsquo;s the thing about weekends though, they are not the indicator of normal usage, and once the week rolled around I was sure the issues would start showing up. Secretly hoping I would have a good enough excuse to shove my sim back into a phone it deserved. Unfortunately, nothing major happened.</p>
<p>The calls were answered. Texts were replaced with telephone calls because it couldn’t be bothered to give myself hand cramp. Most importantly, no-one was any the wiser. This marvellous device sat on my desk next to my computer and did exactly what was asked of it. It wasn’t until the dawn of the third day that I began to release what I needed from a phone. It came in the most embarrassing of situations, at the front of a queue of people trying to pay for something. My card would not work for whatever reason and I had no way of getting another one, nor using a banking app.</p>
<p>I walked away in a grump, with my dumb phone in my hand and simmering over imagined sniggering from people in the queue behind. Curse my desire for a simple life and not having the world at my fingertips when I most needed it. It suddenly occurred to me — well once I had been home, sorted my card out, and then gone to a <em>different shop</em> to buy the things I required — that I do need my device to do more. I began to think of all the occasions where I might need a device with me. Quickly putting together ideas of how I could overcome them.</p>
<p>I ran through them all in my mind to make sure I could solve these problems and continue in blissful device silence. Banking was simple. I return to carrying a wallet with me at all times. The next one was running, that would require a new watch because I can’t use my beloved Apple Watch now. Something simple will do, a cheep Casio and a good route planning session to log my milage means I can jump that hurdle effortlessly. Podcasts on long runs might take a bit more thought.</p>
<p>After exploring the web for MP3 devices, which there are quite a few of even with the rise of smartphones, the possibility of more expenditure started to pull the curtain down on my experiment. Not because of the cost, a simple MP3 player with bluetooth is around £40, but more because of the hassle. I could download the episodes I want to listen to, convert them to MP3 and then put them on the device. Worry about keeping it charged and tracking my run on a new watch. Or I could just use Apple Watch as I have done for years.</p>
<p>I could ask for paper menus and order forms in places that relied on QR code scanning or online ordering. Printing out things I needed to have with me, or writing them in <a href="/2023/03/12/what-is-my.html">my notebook</a>. All the issues that cropped up had solutions, but after a certain point the juice wasn’t worth the squeeze. Despite all the attention it tended to suck away, and all the outlay it cost — the smartphone has pushed itself into my life to such a point that it is just easier to have one. That sucks.</p>

     <p>There are numerous tech things I am intentionally quiet about. Not because I don’t have thoughts about them, but because I would rather not add to the noise of initial emotion blog posts and hot takes. The <a href="https://hu.ma.ne/aipin">Humane AI Pin</a> was one of those things, and while I don’t see it catching on, I think it is a fascinating device because of what it signals.</p>
<p>For years now, technology commentators have been theorising on what comes after the smartphone. It’s explosive success in shaping our lives and how we interact with the world around us is nothing short of remarkable. Although we can debate the positivity of them, there is no denying that the societal changes we have experienced well exceed those caused by similar cultural shifts.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f85131c6f4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This oblong glass and metal device I am typing this blog post on is nothing short of a technological marvel. One that we could not even dream of a decade ago, yet we are searching for <em>the next thing</em> already. For years, many people have been expecting voice first interaction to become the prominent interaction method. No more typing on screens, you speak to something, and it does the heavy lifting for you. It’s easy to forget this vision of easier interaction with your device and view the Ai Pin from its marketing alone.</p>
<p>Right from the start, the device has been developed and now launched differently to what we expected. There’s nothing wrong with that, but the self-importance of the <a href="https://vimeo.com/882968794">companies launch video</a> overshadows the entire device. The successfulness of the device aside (I am very much of the opinion it will fall flat on its face) it says a lot about the future of devices. The one seen by technology investors, and how much they differentiate from regular users.</p>
<p>Although voice first interaction hasn’t caught on as quickly as expected, and many devices have had to go back to putting screens on them, there’s still <em>something</em> there. It’s either a dream, or a marketing push, but the voice first idea clings to the back of my mind with a certain level of excitement. It wasn’t until I really thought about the ridiculousness of wearing a pin on my clothes, or the worse possibility of <a href="/2016/10/10/please-dont-put.html">something on my face</a>, that I came to understand the issues as I see them.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/46e0c533ff.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The truth is, voice first doesn’t need to be voice only. Now granted, the AI Pin <em>does</em> have an over-engineered laser projector. This requires a series of dexterous gestures to interact, which in itself is enough to pull your phone out and do the same thing in a couple of taps. What they really want you to do is push the button and talk to it. Transmitting everything over the constant internet connection to be interpreted, and a response beamed back to you. Let’s hope you never go out of a reliable signal.</p>
<p>You can issue commands like “catch me up” to be read your latest emails and text messages. A command that I expect won&rsquo;t return “nothing, no one likes you” but speaks to the kind of person AI wants to market the device to, or perhaps who purchasers wish to be. This is something that may not raise an eyebrow in Silicon Valley circles, but <em>will</em> on your local high street. What companies fail to realise that the acceptability of voice interaction is varied, and this device must sit in the Venn diagram overlap of <em>can talk to a computer</em> and <em>wearing clothes sufficient to sustain <a href="https://musictech.com/news/gear/humane-ai-pin/#:~:text=It%27s%20a%20small%2C%20square%20device,can%20be%20attached%20to%20clothing.">“the same weight as a tennis ball”.</a></em></p>
<p>I suspect this sits is the same tech douch zone as Juicero, Google Glass and Dyson Zone. The aims of Humane are noble ones, to reduce the time spent using devices that take us away from the world around us. Ensuring that we can use technology in a way that doesn’t impact our attention. Forgetting that there is a far more socially acceptable option of device, one that I am a big fan of—the smartwatch.</p>
<p>After years of wearing an Apple Watch, my preferred interaction method with it, outside simple taps, is by far voice. The watch is already a device people are used to seeing, it fits into life perfectly. There’s nothing on my face and no weird badge sagging my clothes down. I remain convinced it is the best <a href="/2022/02/10/the-ultimate-minimalist.html">minimalist phone you can buy</a>, and wish it were my main device. I have a feeling that had Humane stated with such a device and then pushed into other areas it may have gone down better, but there is always a desire for something new and different.</p>
<p>A new interaction method takes time to find its space in society, like the smartphone. Some never reach that place and die out like Google Glass, and it remains to be seen how long Humane can hang in there. Working to persuade people that the learning curve is worth it. Voice first and lasers seems like an interesting proposition, but new doesn’t always mean good.</p>

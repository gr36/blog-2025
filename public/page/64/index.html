  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The two week free trial I had in place for <a href="https://glass.photo">Glass</a> comes up for renewal today and I am really conflicted. To the point where I think I might sit and wait for a bit before jumping in. Granted the cost is only £26 for a year currently, so what I stand to loose is minimal — but what I stand to gain isn’t exactly much either.</p><p>I stand by much of the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/glass-thoughts/">thoughts I had originally</a> in that I do really like the way it works. The founders of the company really seem to want to make something great for photographers, and I trust them to stay stead fast on their founding aim to avoid all of the social trappings spoken about when pitching the app. However my worry is I just want anything but Instagram and this is just the latest in a long line of attempts to replace it.</p><p>These thoughts on getting into yet another social platform do not happen in a vacuum either. Since diving back into <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/having-a-camera/">taking pictures</a> I have been thinking about what kind of pictures I like to take and also why I enjoying taking pictures in the first place. Worry isn’t the right word to use, but I certainly think about who I take photos for and why I share them. The words I use to describe it can have lots of delusions of grandeur. Using words like “artistic” and “self expression” when in reality they could simply be to try and make me look cool on the internet.</p><h2 id="a-bit-of-validation">A Bit Of Validation</h2><p>I havn’t quite found my ‘thing’ yet and as such take very varied photos, and the reality is I want other people to like them. They are taken as much for me as they are other people and I do worry constantly about making them good enough to share because they are important to me. James Popsys talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/FffEPQqGDPc?t=106">making his photos</a> <em>about</em> something, not just <em>of</em>something. Which really speaks to me when I start to think about capturing a split second of a scene and try to tell the story of why I took that image. Composing a story in one split second when the world around is constantly changing is like meditation to me.</p><p>But with all this fluffiness going on, turns out I like my images being validated and Glass doesn’t do that for me. I know this is the whole reason the platform was built, and I agree with its goal but maybe I just don’t need that at this point in my journey. I have a sinking feeling that my photos are not good enough when compared with the smaller number but higher percentage of actual photographers on Glass and they just disappear into the app.</p><p>When I scroll through the app, the people I follow are also very minimal. Many of those that flocked to the app have fallen off already, with many more to follow once the end of their two weeks trial arrives. In which case I may be left with a ghost town of dead accounts and photos that all seem to look the same.</p><p>Although they are improving things slowly the discovery is not where I want it to be, and the resultant people to follow list features loads of people that take the same kind of pictures and offer me very little in return. Invites are specificity being shared with a more diverse pool of photographers currently but even that doesn’t seem to have moved the needle yet. It doesn’t have much to do with diversity, but everything to do with an iPhone only, invite only barrier to entry — which <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/intentional-barriers/">could be intentional</a>.</p><p>I knew this newness would wear off, and I knew that I had reservations right from the start. Don’t mistake this post for a full on trashing as I still think that in the long run apps like this are needed – I just don’t think it is for me currently. Turns out I quite like getting a few likes.</p><p>Update: Follow up <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/refill-my-glass/">here</a> where I changed my mind and went back!</p>

<blockquote><p>Although I wouldn’t go as far as saying I entirely dislike them, I feel I could experience much better and healthier communities and technologies than those I have found on the likes of Instagram and Twitter.</p></blockquote>
<p>I completely get this feeling. I am constantly looking for somewhere where I fit in and people share the same outlook as me, and because of the way most social platforms work they all suck. They seem to all want my attention, want to force conversations on me, and don’t do enough to grow communities on them. [[Social Media In 2021]]</p>
<p>I love Twitter, and that’s part of the problem. Yet I always get this sinking feeling when I use it for a bit. A feeling of dread, doom and stress instead of interacting with like minded people. Yet I have to still us it, not least because my brain won’t let me quit it [[twitter-muscle-memory]], but more for the (at least fleeting) feeling that I am being social.</p>
<p>I’ve tried micro.blog and although the people on there are lovely, if your face doesn’t fit or you opinions on things are different it can suck. Mainly because the people are all pretty similar. [[bye-micro-blog]] However I am convinced that the smaller, paid for communities are the answer it is just a matter of how to find them.</p>
<p>As Carl signs off with.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s only going to be through experimenting with other community platforms that this will become clearer to me.</p></blockquote>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In case you’ve switched off, or reading my blog for the first time, you will have noticed that I am struggling to use social media in all of its forms – but <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/07/09/a-quick-check/">particularly Twitter</a>. The <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/04/11/time-to-slow/">constant moving nature</a> of the service, coupled with its instance on surfacing the very worst of that constantly flowing information, leaves me feeling exhausted and upset at the world. Sometimes it feels impossible to keep up with all that is going on and that’s because I simply don’t need to.</p>
<p>Social media puts millions of people in front of our face every minute of everyday. Meaning that you can easily communicate with more people than ever before in human history. The bad news is, they can also communicate with you, and the noise can become too much very quickly. Filtering out the noise and getting to the important things easily is one of the most useful skills to learn if you want to live on the web, and lets be honest in this day and age <a href="https://gr36.com/2020/08/09/i-cant-go/">you have to</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What may seem interesting and important now may be completely irrelevant and uninteresting in a few days. – <a href="https://bagerbach.com/blog/how-i-process-inputs-from-the-internet/">Christian Bager Bach Houmann</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The millions of people in front of you can lure you into a false sense of what is important. If 1% of Twitter gets upset at something that’s million of people, but if 1% of your fiends did it wouldn’t be important at all. Without constant mindful thought, the large scale of social media can dangerously push you down rabbit holes to taking in information that simply doesn’t matter. It has a habit of portraying a false senses of importance and urgency towards topics that in very short order become unimportant. However it is only you that can decide what is <em>really</em> important to you.</p>
<p>I find that saving things to read later helps a lot, allowing me to delete articles that no longer interest me when I get around to catching up. Leaving some space between discovery and reaction often dulls the urgency felt to topics and also allows me to get a much fuller picture of what actually goes on. Only then will I try and formulate my thoughts on topics that matter, often in the form of a new note in <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/05/15/my-obsidian-set/">Obsidian</a>.</p>
<p>Writing about the things that matter and the things that I learn is huge. This doesn’t have to be blogging, although <a href="/2021/03/01/this-is-how.html">that would be great</a>, but just writing something down is key. mUch like having a second brain for tasks — journaling, making notes in a system, or starting a full on <a href="/2021/05/15/my-obsidian-set.html">knowledge tree</a> will help to filter noise and has the added benefit of helping to retain much more important information.</p>
<p>The constant need to publish all of our half baked thoughts to anyone that will listen is not a new idea. It has existed almost as long as humans have existed. The only things that has changed is the scope of communication and the availability of the platforms. The <a href="https://gr36.com/2020/09/09/its-not-the/">internet is not to blame</a> for the pressure we all feel, but some simple things do help with cutting down the noise. Being clear about the things that really matter and being aware when you are being sold something different is key.</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s such a hard thing to be honest about. Because money is tied into status, possibility, self-worth, connection, sustenance and more. How many people would be doctors if being a doctor was something you couldn’t get paid for?</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people spout similar things about not working if you love what you do blah blah blah. I mean, its true that if you can find something you love then it doesn’t feel like work, but the world just doesn’t work like people on Linkedin seem to think it does.</p>
<p>Anyway. Who on earth should work for free on anything? Even if you love what you do and don’t get paid for it (like<a href="https://gr36.com/2021/02/08/asking-giving-and/"> my blogging</a> in some part) you should be rewarded for it if you are providing some value. There are enough people trying to get things <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/forexposure/">for exposure</a>, or companies trying to to employ loads of free interns without all this nonsense.</p>
<p>Seth uses this post to pose some interesting questions about payment for simple things and the value of what people are doing, but providing value to others for no reward is dumb.</p>

      <p>Chris Wilson on <a href="https://chrisjwilson.me/2021/08/06/how-do-you.html">How do you know if they’re a good app reviewer?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you more trust a reviewer who jumps apps as often as they change clothes or one who hasn’t changed app in years? The one who always changes probably is probably too interested in novelty over real usefulness, but the long term user might be too stuck in their ways.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have been thinking a lot about reviews lately as I <a href="/2021/07/29/having-a-camera.html">dive back into cameras</a> and lust after about a million different lenses. Over the past year I have begun to have a thick layer of distrust against almost anyone doing reviews. YouTube especially has gone from being an invaluable resource when researching into a purchase, to something that provides very little value.</p>
<p>This isn’t just tech. It’s cameras, cars, days out, almost every company trying to sell you stuff has infiltrated the world of online reviews and it’s a pain. Unless I know the reviewer or the person making the video I find myself having to watch multiple people saying almost exactly the same thing until I switch off. I get the need for income if you want to ‘make it big’ and I know a lot of people watch these kinds of videos as entertainment, but when I am trying to research something now I am a bit stuck.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It is really hard for me to form thoughts on new services as quickly as I would like. My initial excitement usually dulls in very quick order but not before I have shelled out some cash to use it. As much as I never think anyone wants to read my thoughts when there are far more <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/13/glass">popular takes</a>, I do have a few things to say about photography apps.</p><p>Since reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781847942548">No Filter</a> last year I have been a little sad. The excellent behind the scenes story of Instagram from founding to acquisition made me miss the service even more. I am still filled with a longing for the old Insta days, unfortunately one that I know couldn’t exist today. It’s hard to believe that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/20/instagram/?guccounter=1">just 10 short years ago</a> Instagram was the popular up and coming app with all the buzz, but a decade is a long time on the internet and things change.</p><p>The modern version is 5 or 6 different things crammed into one app, and removes exactly what Instagram is for. This, understandably, has left <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5FHv0g0agg">many photographers</a> out in the cold and a little bitter considering how much work they have put into the service over the last decade. So many have been looking for something new. In recent memory the app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/gala-creativity-welcomed/id1560876288">Gala</a> arrived and <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1421159556571353089?s=20">looked promising</a> but ultimately failed to keep my attention.</p><h2 id="a-little-different">A Little Different</h2><p>Glass is different though. It is set up as an anti Instagram and removes all of the foils that entrap almost anything that Facebook touches. The app is designed to display the photographs beautifully, removing almost all engagement traps. Likes, follower counts and a constant strive for influence is replaced by a constant stream of the latest images uploaded.</p><p>The design focuses on the images themselves and the details of them. Displaying privacy conscious EXIF data about the image giving you an insight into exactly how the image was shot. You get to not only see the images, but feel the desire behind them, if your a photographer of course and know your shutter speed from your aperture.</p><p>My first log in allowed me to follow a few people that I knew already, but also find others that took the kind of images I like to see and learn from. As an amateur shooter being able to peek behind the curtain and understand how a shot was made proves a great learning angle too.</p><h2 id="glass-intentions">Glass Intentions</h2><p>The founders talk a great talk, and seem to be walking exactly as then intended. When <a href="https://om.co/2021/08/10/glass/">talking to Om Malik</a> they sold the service well and aimed it to fulfill exactly what I and many photographers were hoping for.</p><p>We’ve intentionally avoided any public counts. We don’t want Glass ever to become a popularity contest. We’re not home for influencers. We are a home for photographers. – Tom Watson, founder of Glass</p><p>There is zero counting and metrics going on. No followers (well I guess you could count them yourself if you want to), no hashtags and best of all no likes. I want that rush of dopamine as much as the next person, but double tapping is far too easy. Where as in Glass if you like a photo the only choice you have is to leave a comment, which feels much better.</p><p>With these metrics gone there is no algorithm at play currently. I am sure if the app grows there will be no choice but to tweak this slightly, for the risk of becoming unmanageable. Glass is no where near reaching <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/the-problem-of/">a scale that needs more though putting into it</a>, but only time will tell. I do fear that they will eventually feel the pain of volume, however with zero metrics there would be no point gaming the system anyway.</p><p>Which in short means that my trust in getting into the app feels very well placed currently. They have spoken publicly about the very straight forward way you are able to get your photos back out again should you wish to leave, which is also great. The iOS only limit also seems to be lifting with Android and web versions in the works, so hopefully everyone can join very soon.</p><h2 id="paying-for-it">Paying For It</h2><p>However. Saying things like “We believe great photography can come from anywhere and anyone” is fine. But the anyone is only those that can stump up the £50 a year entrance fee. Don’t get me wrong I love the fact that paying money to support a service means none of the bad stuff that comes from free services. However the worry would be that Glass becomes just another service along side all the others.</p><p>If I want as many people as possible to see my shots then I have no choice but to post them every where else too. So when the next years subscription comes around am I willing to pay again to look at photos posted by others everywhere else too?</p><h2 id="reservations-prevail">Reservations Prevail</h2><p>My answer is probably yes, but the true telling will be how many people stick around in in a few months time. A <a href="https://gabz.org/2021/08/15/things-i-love.html">few</a> <a href="https://chrishannah.me/glass-a-new-photo-sharing-app/">of my</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbirchler/status/1426920735113629696?s=20">friends</a> share similar feelings towards the new hotness app but I might have to cross my fingers and hope. Following high profile shooters is one thing, but I would like a mix of people I know.</p><p>As the opening few sentences gave way to a flood of my opinions I am still very bearish on the future. I can’t tell people how good a service is until I have used it for <a href="https://chrisjwilson.me/2021/08/06/how-do-you.html">more than 14 days</a>, and more so for a service that costs money and isn’t for everyone. My hope is that the grand plans for Glass keep on track and achieve even more, but my worry is the new hotness burns out and we all skulk back to Instagram again.</p>

      <p>I am sure I will keep going on about it, and also spam my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gr36m/">Instragram</a> now, but having a camera back is a great feeling. I am no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3DkFux8Iv-aYnTRWzwaiBA">Peter McKinnon</a> but to try and build my skills as much as possible I have been watching loads of YouTube, and one point in particular has struck a cord with me and applies to so much of life.</p><p>James Popsys discuses some <a href="https://youtu.be/RXO2dcWg_G0?t=441">tips for beginner photographers</a>, not the usual shutter speed and ISO stuff, but actual practice advice on getting better. You see, in photography it’s pretty hard to judge how well your progression is coming on. The easy thing to do is compare your images to ones shared by your favorite photographers and get down beat about it. While it’s important to remember their skill level is something to aim for, what we don’t see is their trash can.</p><p>For every stunning image shared there are hundreds, if not thousands, of images in the bin. All we see is the polished end result curated to share online, and that goes for almost everything in life. For every runner that jogs past your flat out sprint. Or every writer pushing out amazingly written concise posts. We don’t see the whole story. No one is present for the painful miles of hard work, the deleted drafts and indeed everything else that goes on behind the scenes.</p><p>This could be said for all social media too, comparing <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/insides-vs-outsides/">your insides to others outsides</a> can be completely demotivating when you are trying to learn a skill or just get better at something. What is worse is that we all know it with ourselves, we pick the best of everything to showcase, but forget when consuming others work. However keeping in mind other peoples trash can is exactly the same as yours can be vitally important.</p><p>I am a big proponent of marginal gains, and improving steadily and consistently over time in whatever it is we choose to do. Spending time to make sure we are working towards a goal at all times and only using others to motivate us in the correct way. No matter how good the end product may be, we all have a trash can full of rubbish that never sees the light of day.</p>

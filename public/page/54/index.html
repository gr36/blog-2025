  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Have you ever heard the expression that the universe is a mirror? The idea that whatever you put out into it, gets reflected straight back at you. It seems a little absurd on the face of it. A theory akin to <a href="https://www.thesecret.tv">The Secret</a>, that you can manifest whatever you want just from your frame of mind. Yet, I think there’s something in this, you know.</p><p>Ever been in a room with someone who’s in a bad mood? You don’t need to see or hear anything, you can feel the energy in the room. The stress feels as if it is leaking out of their body and often starts to affect surrounding people. That feeling lights something in me and I often need to get out of there straight away. It makes kind of sense thought when you think about it.</p><p>All the negative stuff we put out or see every day must go somewhere. Crappy tweets, passive-aggressive comments at work, it can’t hurt to be mindful of it.</p><p>Since listening to a fairly out-there conversation with <a href="https://www.duncantrussell.com/episodes/2021/12/10/meet-delic-live-with-aubrey-marcus-johnny-pemberton-and-vince-kadlubek">Duncan Trussell and Aubrey Marcus,</a> I’ve been more concerned with the negative energy I put out. This isn’t directly anything to do with <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/goodbye-for-a-bit/">my hiatus from Twitter</a>, but there’s got to be some benefit to not seeing all that the cesspool has to offer, numerous times day. Given the fact that some people learn to express more outrage over time whilst using social media has been <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2021/08/13/likes-and-shares-teach-people-express-more-outrage-online">scientifically proven,</a> it could be manipulating us all more than we think.</p><p>As I wrote about yesterday, I know I am more predisposed to this kind of thing. I’ve seen the results for myself. From emotionally abusive and manipulative partners to down right aggressive work colleagues, they’ve all taken their toll on me in one way or another. So in a bid to do what I can to steam the flow, I’m beginning to be more mindful of the way I am and hope that this brings about a positive change in others. It already makes <em>me</em> feel better!</p>

      <p>James Tocchio on his view <a href="https://casualphotophile.com/2022/01/06/yes-the-camera-matters/">that the camera matters</a>:</p><blockquote>I’ve been missing that. All of that. And it’s really hit me this week that I’ve spent the past couple of years thinking that the camera didn’t matter anymore. But I think, maybe, that it matters more than ever.</blockquote><p>If I am honest, I’ve not yet worked out what all the words are, they seem jumbled and don’t really get to the point. Yet, the whole time reading I was thinking about my thoughts about my camera, so I guess that’s the point.</p><p>I have two, my A7c and my iPhone 13 Pro. After spending some time accepting that I need both in my life, they now serve entirely different uses for me. Neither is more important than the other, but I am glad I have both.</p><p>My smartphone needs to have a good camera to capture all of life's moments. My kids doing things I want to let others know about, or record a memory I want to look back on. Perhaps to show the world what I am up to and post a <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk">short post about it</a>. I often try to put come artistic flair on it, but more often than not they are candid, slightly blurry moments frozen in time.</p><p>My camera on the other hand is for expressing myself. Picking it up to do something, or go somewhere, I want to capture with my self-expression. Like painting a picture or making some music, this is my art. Granted I am still learning, but it's the way I want to express myself outside my blog and what I am dedicated to.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There have been a few points in my life that have felt like it was ending. The specifics of these no longer matter to me, a long time ago fading into insignificance. Yet at the time, they felt like major issues that appeared insurmountable.</p><p>Of course, everything can be overcome. The feelings of major issues fade in time. Life moves forward, and the events depicted in the stories told about it evolve.</p><blockquote>It'll go from being, you know, a book of my life to becoming a chapter to a paragraph to a line to a word to a doodle - <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jason-sudeikis-august-cover-profile">Jason Sudeikis</a></blockquote><p>Not everything happens like this. There have been turning points that need to be worked through, both good and bad. They still retain the size and gravity that the moment dictates, but they still fade in time. As Jason sums up above, depending on when the book is written, all lives events shrink in importance the further you get from them. From a chapter, to a few lines, and often become next to nothing.</p><p>The rawness of emotions regularly feel overwhelming at the time. But like physical scars, they need time and space to heal. They also need to be looked after, tended to and dealt with. Ignore an issue, and it will get worse over time. Baby it, and the surrounding area will stiffen up and make matters worse. The only answer is to deal with the issue and recognise your body and its amazing ability to heal itself, in time.</p>

      <p>Colin Devroe on <a href="http://cdevroe.com/2022/01/05/bye-social-media/">Quitting Social Media</a>:</p><blockquote>Not that I can’t focus. I can sit down and get into flow on a programming project more often than not. But when I’m still, when I’m idle, when I feel like I could be bored at any moment I grab my phone and scroll through Twitter which sends my mind into overdrive on a million topics, timelines, thoughts, and emotions.<br />I don’t think this is good for the human brain. I know it isn’t good for my brain.</blockquote><p>It’s the last few words of this post that I’ve been saying for a while. I know the are are loads of positives in connecting with people, yet every time I move away I get “yeah but why”.</p><p>I know, for a fact, that when I use social media a lot I am a worse person. I waste more time, I procrastinate more and I think about things less. My desire to watch more films, play more games and also write more just doesn’t have time for scrolling through other peoples lives. My Twitter obsession started more than a decade ago and it’s time for me to take back my brain.</p><p>Yes I know I do this every so often. No it’s not going to be for a year like Colin. If Social Media is good for you, great, but the amount of push back I get is stupid. <strong>You do you.</strong></p><p>I will check in a bit, but the last few days of only being able to go on Twitter on my desktop has been really helpful for me to see things more clearly. So if a little is good, more must be better, right?</p><p>Well, we’ll see. Goodbye for a bit. Feel free to reach out in other ways if you want to. Love you all.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Taking inspiration from a <a href="https://www.kvn.li/plan2022/">few other bloggers</a> posts that I have read, I thought I would post my intentions for the upcoming year. That way everything is out in the open and there is at least a little accountability in the universe. The new year is usually when I start something new, leading to it dieing around April time. This year is different.</p><p>Nothing new is planned for this year. That’s not to say that opportunities and ideas won’t arise, but I intend to double down on what I am currently doing.</p><h2 id="writing">Writing</h2><p>Posting every day in November was <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/writing-everyday-is-exhausting/">exhausting but also very beneficial</a>. My blog has broken even for the first time in years for November <em>and</em> December. I am never going to make the money out of writing that I have in the past, but getting to a stage where my traffic justifies the work I do is a fantastic feeling. All from a small Carbon advert at the top of each page and post.</p><p>I will continue to post regularly, no numbers, no targets, just solid output whenever inspiration strikes. I have moulded my workflow into a great place, filed with Shortcuts and publishing prompts that I <em>know</em> I can continue at a good pace. Due to my increased output I like to think my writing has improved, and I know my style — which is half the battle with writing.</p><p>I have a few posts lined up for other publications in the works, so I hope that this will bring a bit more exposure to my blog and open up other avenues for creative work.</p><h2 id="other-skills">Other Skills</h2><p>Learning new skills recently to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-new-home/">build my new blog</a> and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-to-use-tailwind-with-your-ghost-blog/">take on new challenges</a> has been enjoyable. Having <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2021/12/24/micro-alto.html">ported a new theme to micro.blog</a> I have plans in the works to do some more, as well as produce my own theme for Ghost.</p><p>This year will be one of less wasted time on social media and more learning new things to expand my skills. I hope that this again will open up more areas for creative work and allow me to progress my career.</p><h2 id="other-areas">Other Areas</h2><p>After the usual discussions with family on New Year's Eve, we have all outlined what we want to work on this year. Mine is one of improving my social side in person and make more connections. I struggle a lot with in person socialising and lean far too heavily on social media to provide the needed conversation. How I do this is something as yet to be finalised, but no doubt will involve pushing myself a long way out my comfort zone.</p><p>I have also highlighted my desire to play more games, watch more films and also read more books. With that comes to an end, my eclectic range of things to do in 2022. My overall theme is “more of the same”, worry less and enjoy more.</p>

      <p>A friend Of mine, <a href="https://gabz.blog">Gabz</a> has been going backwards and forwards on where to host his blog. He tried Ghost for a bit, but went back to micro.blog mainly because of a feature he likes called “on this day”. Much like some features on social media, it surfaces posts from the current date one year ago, meaning you can see what you were posting. This gave me pause for thought.</p><p>Not on his blog, it's wonderful, but the desire to look back. It is human nature to lean on our memories. They made sure we didn’t go to the dangerous places, knew what a predator looked like, and allowed us to flourish as a species. Learning and growing from our memories is a fundamental building block of success in every area of life. Yet, I am not convinced we need to do so much of it now.</p><p>Due to digital technology, almost every area of our memories are being offloaded to the web. Each image permanent, each post saved and in some cases brought back to life every so often. I take photos of my kids and life things all the time, yet have a mentality to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/shot-with-meaning/">hardly ever look back</a>. My personality is fixated on living in the present and looking forward — but some people find looking back important.</p><p>I get a lot of benefit of offloading my mental load to other means. Even this blog is my place to think out loud and work though my thoughts to conclusion. Linking back to old posts that have supporting ideas or often changes in attitude are essential for my personal improvement. Clearly there is a massive benefit to looking at the improvements that have happened and the journey you have made through life, I am just not convinced it needs to be so fixed.</p><p>Don’t our memories need to be a bit fluffy and malleable? Would life be better if we didn’t remember so much. Just the bits and pieces we need to, in a way that suits us. Can growing and learning still happen if we can’t move away from mistakes and events that have happened?</p><p>These are all questions I have not answered yet. I am sure there will be a time when I will be thankful that my past self took so many pictures of life events. They might be the only thing to stir the memories from their sleeping place in my brain. My interest is how different we as people can be when it comes to our memories and the things we value most.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I am not the type of person to be influenced by other people's thoughts, but they often prompt thoughts of my own. Lots of <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/photography-needs-to-be-fun/">talk about Glass</a> from people I follow has led me to think about my usage, and it’s complicated to some them all up.</p><p>The simple one is I love using it. The app design is beautiful. An uninterrupted feed of great photos with a well-thought-out UI. Finding people to follow is pretty easy now that categories feature heavily. Meaning my feed to full of both the types of images I like to look at and those of the few friends I have that use Glass.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/5a7f3dcf37.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>Granted, the standard of photography feels a bit intimidating. Glass is definitely where a lot of pro level shooters share their shots. Some very skilled individuals simultaneously give me imposter syndrome and teach me lots about the pictures they take. Glass can be very inspiring in terms of the type of shots that look good and the settings to be able to capture them.</p><p>With all that said, I’m losing the motivation to check it. If it wasn’t for the wonderful widget, I think I would have deleted the app by now. Trends in photography absolutely exist, but I see lots of the same type of images. All shown in the same way, and often whole sets of images posted one after the other in a ‘dump’ that floods my timeline for a long while. However, I can put up with all this, frankly I put up with a lot bigger issues by using Instagram — but posting in multiple places is untenable.</p><p>No one I know apart from nerds on the internet uses Glass, and that is unlikely to change. I don’t need Glass as a portfolio of sorts, so I think it has reached its usefulness lifespan. The novelty has worn off for many people I follow, leading me to question my usage. As nice as the app is, and as great as the team behind it are, my interest in using something so niche is coming to an end.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Some would say we have an unhealthy relationship with our phones. That for many it is a digital attachment to our hands, ever present in a world that increasingly encourages it. Others would argue it’s a revolution, allowing us to be more connected to each other and have more information at our fingertips than ever before. We all sit somewhere on the spectrum between those two extremes, but I find it essential to try to establish where you are, and where you want to be.</p><p>Personally, I have a weird relationship with mine. I don’t like to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-dont-use-my-phone-much/">use it much</a>, but I am stuck in a world, a job, and an interest group that needs one. Having come to the realisation that I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-cant-go/">can’t get rid of it</a>, I like to push it to the extremity. Or at least that is the story I like to tell myself.</p><p>I don’t like to use my phone, but I do. Going through periods of addiction, then realisation, before I return to sporadic use. The reasons for this are varied. I am unquestionably being manipulated by the apps and services I use, but all of this <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/its-not-the/">lays at my door</a>. The reality is that I love using my phone, it allows me to interact with more people, get more stuff done and generally be more social than I would be in person. However, using it makes me a worse person. I don’t sleep as much, I am distracted, and I hate what <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/needing-feedback/">it does to my brain</a>. So, I ask myself this question, often whist staring at the slab of metal and glass in my hand. What is my smartphone for?</p><p>What does it achieve? Which tasks couldn’t be achieved without it? What can I do easier? There are numerous answers to these questions, but focusing on them is important. Using the tool for the purpose you bought it for in the first place and not sliding down the hole is all about self-control. Being able to know what job your phone <em>is</em> doing, and what it is doing <em>to</em> you.</p><p>Everyone’s answer to those questions will be different. I need my phone to keep in contact with people I don’t see in person. For taking photos of my kids to save. To share my thoughts and ideas with the world. I don’t need it for scrolling through Reddit at 2am. Or for tweeting random stuff instead of interacting with people that are around me. However, for others this will be different, and some of those things will be true, but knowing this is half the battle.</p>

     <p>In my tendency to over simplify things, I <a href="/2023/05/17/get-a-notebook.html">wrote a post</a> about how to maximise your productivity. There are no apps involved, just <a href="/2023/03/12/what-is-my.html">a notebook</a> and something to write with. No fanciness, no expensive things, just a tried and tested method of keeping everything with you – the problem is: How on earth do you put it to use?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a practice that is rife in productivity, it keeps people busy and keeps whole companies in business, it’s called <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/">the collectors&rsquo; fallacy</a>. The logic that saving some things can be helpful, so more must be better. With the only issue being you are quickly drowning in saved ‘things’ and cant make use of it. As R.J. Nestor put it in <a href="https://signup.rjnestor.com/posts/weekend-upgrade-35-surface-tension">his newsletter</a>, the issue is often that capture is too easy and I would also argue too permanent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…capture in itself is not the primary problem for most of us. The problem is that we capture too many things, and we don’t have a corresponding way to surface what we’ve captured. — R.J. Nestor, Surface Tension</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ve all be there. Like a note hoarder, we can&rsquo;t bear to not save something, or later delete it “just incase”. When digital storage is so plentiful, there might seem like no downside to collecting absolutely everything to refer to at some point in the future. However, it then becomes impossible to sift through the pointless stuff and get to the important parts of your system.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/605ca0ed12.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In almost every productivity system I have come across there is always some kind of ‘inbox’ followed by a sorting phase. A review <em>has</em> to take place to make the most of the things you have saved, no matter if they are digital or physical things, you <a href="/2022/12/31/manual-practices-to.html">must review them</a>. The next part is painful, though, you must now admit your errors and throw out most of what you saved.</p>
<p>Not throw it out per se, but at least no longer dwell on it. If it’s digital, consider deleting it or perhaps not tagging and sorting it. If is a physical note, don’t copy it anywhere else, read it, digest it, and then decide to move on or not. The real benefit of physical notes, of which I am a massive proponent of, is that by writing them out you are more likely to remember them anyway. As much as <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/you-will-remember-information-longer-you-hand-write-notes.html">70 percent increase</a> if you go through them again in the next 24 hours, and it produces <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210319080820.htm">stronger brain activity</a> too.</p>
<p>This post is about more than that though, it is about getting the most out of <em>your</em> system, and that involves sorting your notes afterwards. I have tried <a href="/2023/03/17/indexing-a-used.html">indexing my notebooks</a> for more benefit, but that didn’t last long. Copying out and sorting my mess of a handwritten ledger has proven is essential to surfacing information I can use later on. Making sure the helpful notes hang around, and the useless ones fade away.</p>

     <p>One thing I love about consuming so much written on the internet is that it raises interesting thoughts in my head. Sure, I get annoyed at the constant cycle of AI this, metaverse that, but newsletters like <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/on-the-internet-you-can-in-some-sense?publication_id=9317&amp;isFreemail=true">this edition for Garbage day</a> from Ryan Broderick really made me think.</p>
<p>He discusses a friend who passed away, leaving behind herself scattered over the internet, and ponders on what will stay behind. The below passage brought up thoughts about the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_(2017_film)">Disney film CoCo</a>, that you die twice, once in physical form and again when the last person alive forgets about you. In the modern world, that could be three times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, it seems, we die three times. First, when you stop breathing, second, when a corporation deletes your account, and, third, when someone says your name for the last time.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve written before about my <a href="/2021/07/27/be-happy-it.html" class="u-in-reply-to">thoughts about death</a>, but the way that technology and the services you have used is interesting to think about. In many ways, I could echo around the web for years after my passing because I have put so much content onto it which could be a comfort or dressing to others in my life. Or I could be permanently deleted once I stop paying.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c5f1d00d31.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Ryan talks about all Facebook Messenger chats disappearing once an account turns into a memorial, which would be something that other people might miss. However, Twitter is now recovering whole accounts that have laid dormant for a while, which will include many people no longer with us. No doubt to flog for profit. Bringing into sight the realisation that where you put your online life could be more important in death.</p>
<p>All this talk of deleting accounts and recovering dormant ones reminds me of wanting a username that appears unused. That handle that I desire <em>could</em> in fact be someone’s comfort, and the ethics of recovering it become a little murky. Thankfully, I feel blessed that I have placed my posts on micro.blog, and they will remain online indefinitely <a href="https://www.manton.org/2023/05/13/reclaiming-usernames-policy.html" class="u-in-reply-to">thanks to Manton</a>.</p>
<p>So, should the time come for me to leave this mortal realm, I <em>will</em> die two deaths, but perhaps not a third.</p>

  </div>
<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Can I apologise if this post triggers you in any way, these are simply my thoughts after using a ‘mechanical keyboard’ for a bit, and they may not be all positive. The people that love using these types of keyboard are plentiful online, so I may get an influx of name-calling after this, but please bear with me. I decided to <a href="/2023/05/08/i-might-regret.html">have a bit of an experiment</a> and dove in knowing absolutely nothing, so this very well is the reason behind my thoughts.</p>
<p>First things first, I bought a <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k3-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron K3 v2</a> after some feedback online and seeing that this was reasonably cheap and approachable. This came with Optical Brown switches. I chose this because and after years of using a Magic Keyboard I felt this was a good introduction to this minefield. Your thoughts may differ on this, but I want to be transparent straight away.</p>
<p>So, I get it. I think that using a mechanical keyboard provides so much tactile feedback that it’s hard to understand until you use one. Known for their ‘clicky’ keys and their multitude of modifications and set-ups you can make, the world of mechanical keyboards is one that I now understand. However, I had two major issues that may be due to this specific keyboard or may just be trade-offs you have to make, I don’t know, but let&rsquo;s just say I am writing this on a magic keyboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3fd99b390a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="comfort">Comfort</h2>
<p>They’re no getting around the fact that I didn’t find the K3 very comfortable to use. To accommodate the travel of the keys, even this ‘low-profile’ keyboard is considerably chunkier than I am used to. I knew this going in so allowed it some time to get to, but the hovering my hands had to do, and the weird slant of the keys just made a long typing session painful.</p>
<p>Could I have become used to it, perhaps over time. Was a prepared to risk it, absolutely not. The K3 added its own ‘screw your wrists’ take on this by slanting the keyboard itself slightly toward you, but the keys slightly away. Meaning, I had no confidence in using the keyboard even after a week or so of hard use. My wrists hurt bad. I tried a wrist rest, I tried changing my posture, I tried numerous things, but it was just too different for my body to like.</p>
<h2 id="wireless">Wireless</h2>
<p>As I wanted this to replace my current set up, being wireless was a big selling point. I went into this knowing that this might mean that keypresses are a little less reliable and that wired is often the preferred set up for people. The Keychron K3 was straightforward to set up, came with Mac-specific keys already on the board, but still fell down. The connect time for using the keyboard after being idle for more than 10 minutes was painful. I could change this in the setting to keep it witched on, but opted instead to use the wired mode – only this didn’t work either.</p>
<p>The cable that the keyboard comes with doesn’t connect to my Mac, at all. Why on earth it is a USB-A version I don’t know, but obviously if you have a Mac that&rsquo;s less than 4 years old you have to use a dongle, but the cable doesn’t work with a dongle! I am not <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Keychron/comments/m5frps/unable_to_use_keychron_k2_with_macbook_in_wired/">alone in finding this out</a>. It works with a regular USB-C cable, so I <em>could</em> use it wired, but at this point I’d just about given up. My frustration for this issue is squarely aimed at this specific keyboard and the choices they made to provide a Mac setup keyboard without a Mac cable, so I can’t hold that against other companies.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-just-me">This is just me</h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t hold this against all mechanical keyboards, like I said before, I genuinely understand the enjoyment people get from using them. The reason I no longer have one is personal, not a slight against those that do. To sum up, I chose to return the Keychron K3 and go back to my Magic Keyboard for a few reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfort of typing in a position I am used to</li>
<li>Connection issues with a Mac</li>
<li>Not wanting to spend more money and still not be happy</li>
<li>Touch ID</li>
</ul>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my update in a nutshell.</p>

     <p>A few years ago, I read the book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781090532084">Ruined by design</a>. You could consider it <a href="/2023/05/12/finished-reading-hooked.html">Hooked</a> written by an ethical designer. It talks a lot about doing the work that you want to do, and not compromising on your morals and values. At various points in your life, that might be extremely difficult or impossible, but you must know what your values are and stand for them in everything you do.</p>
<p>If you want to be the type of person that enjoys working, either for yourself or someone else, you must display your core values <em>all</em> the time. Do not compromise yourself to gain things, as this will just make you feel a bit rubbish, not to mention the frustration that comes from being led down a path you would rather not take. Believe me, I’ve been there in my early life, compromising wheat I stood for in return for more money or a flashy title. There is nothing at the end of the path but crap feelings and lack of motivation.</p>
<p>When I look at people in my working life that struggle to get things done, it is because they would rather not do the tasks that they have. No-one wants to do <em>everything</em> that they have to do, but a general sense of enjoyment and belief leads to better productivity. You don’t have to have the best job in thew world, you just need it to be something that reflects you as a person. Pursuing passion has more to do with reflecting yourself in the things you do that <em>what</em> you do.</p>

     <p>I am hyper aware that I have been mentioning this constantly for quite a while but bare with me. Since watching a few videos on YouTube about Notion, their algorithm thinks I am some kind of productivity hustle porn obsessive. It constantly forces videos about apps, morning routines and hacks to make my life my productive – when in fact my outlook is the opposite. There <a href="/2023/01/30/there-will-always.html">will always be more work</a> to do, so it’s time to do less, <a href="https://dailystoic.com/do-less-better/">but better</a>.</p>
<p>My biggest productivity tip isn’t <a href="/2023/05/13/you-do-not.html">another app</a> or staring at the sun at 6am. The best thing you can do is get a notebook and use it. You don’t need to spend much, it doesn’t need to be fancy. Any old book you have lying around or can pick up for cheap is fine. Simply have a notebook by your side and jot things down when you need to.</p>
<p>Everything, absolutely everything. Write it down in the same place as everything else. You <em>could</em> use a notes app if that’s your thing, but make sure you use one notes app, it really doesn’t matter which one, and keep all your notes in one place. I am a massive proponent of <a href="/2023/03/12/what-is-my.html">keeping a notebook</a>, but digital notes are often the route for most people to get stuff done. Just make sure you write little notes about everything that there is even a small chance you think it might be helpful. You <strong>will not</strong> remember it, write it down.</p>
<p>You don’t need to start a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com">second brain</a>, or do some weird <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management">PKM</a> stuff, you just need to have a place <em>full</em> of things that will help you out. Record things you find interesting, things you need to remember, things that might help you work later on, literally anything you might need later on. You don’t need to start a <a href="/2023/05/10/my-adventures-with.html">commonplace book</a> or anything, you just require a notebook around, all the time.</p>

     <p>Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-previews-live-speech-personal-voice-and-more-new-accessibility-features/">announced</a> new accessibility features and tools that will help people with cognitive, vision, hearing, and mobility needs. These tools are designed to be user-friendly and incorporate on-device machine learning to ensure privacy. This shows Apple&rsquo;s longstanding commitment to accessibility and making products for everyone.</p>
<p>Assistive Access is a feature that distills apps and experiences into their essential features, making them easier to use for people with cognitive disabilities. The feature focuses on activities that are foundational to iPhone and iPad, such as connecting with loved ones, capturing and enjoying photos, and listening to music. Assistive Access also includes a distinct interface with high-contrast buttons and large text labels, as well as tools to help supporters tailor the experience for the individual they support.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9f5326e05d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>For users who are nonspeaking or at risk of losing their ability to speak, Apple has introduced Live Speech and Personal Voice. Live Speech allows users to type what they want to say and have it spoken out loud during phone and FaceTime calls, as well as in-person conversations. Personal Voice allows users at risk of losing their ability to speak to create a voice that sounds like them.</p>
<p>Detection Mode in Magnifier makes it easier for users with vision disabilities to interact with physical objects that have several text labels. For example, while using a household appliance, Point and Speak combines input from the Camera app, the LiDAR Scanner, and on-device machine learning to announce the text on each button as users move their finger across the keypad.</p>
<p>These new features and tools build on Apple&rsquo;s long history of making technology accessible, so that everyone has the opportunity to create, communicate, and do what they love. The groundbreaking features were designed with feedback from members of disability communities every step of the way, to support a diverse set of users and help people connect in new ways.</p>

     <p>Slight mislead here, you do need apps, but you don’t need a ton of them. Every single post I see will tell you they use this app and that service, which is great — but that is unique to them. That doesn’t mean <em>you</em> need to start spending money.</p>
<p>In most situations, you will be perfectly fine with the stock options you have available. The only time to start looking at other options is <em>if</em> you start to hit issues. My best advice is to continually try to work around this first. Shortcuts is a wonderful stock app that I use to implement ‘new’ features into apps.</p>
<p>I am as guilty of this app arrival fallacy as anyone. I convince myself that I just require this new thing, and then I’ll be super productive — but I don’t. The truth is that is often hard to accept is that a new app absolutely will not make you more productive. Sure, fancy services look nice, the marketing makes you think you can get a load more done, but the real answer is to work smarter.</p>
<p>You will be more productive by having a good system in place, not having a fancy app. I will say it again for those not paying attention, a <a href="/2019/07/29/a-new-productivity.html">new app will not make you more productive</a>.</p>

     <p>I’m having a few weird experiences on YouTube at the minute. I watched a <a href="https://micro.blog/gr36/18975057">few videos on mechanical keyboards</a> the other day, and I think I might have ruined Google&rsquo;s impression of me forever. It started as a few PC building things and got worse from there. Mixed in with the usual productivity tripe and hustle things that Google seems to think all people want to watch, I have discovered a whole world of people doing their work with AI.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine and everything. I am a big fan of making the new tools work for you, and use <a href="https://www.notion.so/product/ai">Notion AI</a> frequently — but when it comes down to making AI write your assignments and complete your notes, it all gets a bit silly. If the entire point of performing an action is the result, then AI is arguably the best tool to use. You can achieve some great things and cut down the time you invest dramatically. However, if the activity is the point of the exercise, then just do the work.</p>
<p>The point of writing an essay is to demonstrate your learning. The result is not the point of the exercise, the point is your ability to complete the task. This goes double for getting AI to write your notes. Again, the entire point in writing notes on a subject (in a classroom or out of one) is the practice itself. By writing things down, you remember them, and record them in your words. AI defeats the point.</p>
<p>In these instances, if time saved is what you are trying to achieve with AI, then you’d be better off not doing it at all. To get better at something, learn information or just show others that you know things — Just Do The Work. There are no shortcuts in life, you can&rsquo;t adopt a morning routine or use a tool to cheat your way through because at some point you will get found out. By doing the work, you improve yourself.</p>

     <p>Stray too far into self-help or productivity circles, and you will soon come across this idea of a commonplace book. The practice of writing everything down and keeping it in a place you can access later is held up as the reason people are successful and a way for you to get the most out of life. Although people like <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/07/h-p-lovecrafts-commonplace-book/">HP Lovecraft</a>, <a href="https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/john-miltons-commonplace-book">John Milton</a> and even <a href="https://myowncommonplacebook.wordpress.com/tag/leonardo-da-vinci/">Leonardo do Vinci</a> kept one by their side, it is a practice that can be hard to stick too in the modern world.</p>
<p>Commonplace books are a tradition spanning from <a href="https://notebookofghosts.com/2018/02/25/a-brief-guide-to-keeping-a-commonplace-book/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">the Middle Ages</a>, but one that seems improper in the modern world. Despite all the obvious benefits of manual tasks, the avoidance of feeling out of place is often a powerful feeling. One that I frequently can’t be overcome, I just don’t want to be <em>that</em> guy. There’s just no getting around the fact that carrying around a notebook in a digital world appears strange to most people.</p>
<p>As such, my first effort at keeping this ‘book’ had to be digital. It makes the most sense as I have my phone or my watch on my wrist nearly all the time, or I am sat at my computer working. Not to mention, all the things I save are then searchable and referenceable easily from all my devices. Saving digital things just makes sense.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9f55ac5bca.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>An app such as Evernote would make an excellent digital commonplace book, in fact, numerous people I know have been doing this all along without even knowing it. Storing photos of notes, whiteboards, web clippings, meeting briefs and all sorts of things in the app to refer to later. Not wanting to spend money on Evernote after being burnt before, I opted to use <a href="/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html">Apple Notes instead</a>.</p>
<p>The main reason for doing this was to make sure I carried things that I wanted to remember. That I got myself into a better state of working though my ideas and working on them later. So, I built <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ed9071a3301944e4b7c368f93cf831db">a Shortcut to help me</a> on this journey. To capture quotes from articles I read, thoughts that I could dictate from my Apple Watch, and also anything else I stumbled across.</p>
<p>The premise was simple. My iCloud notes now contained a folder titled commonplace book. Each time I wanted to capture something, the shortcut checked for a note titled with the current date, if it was missing, it created it along with a time stamped entry. If the note already existed, it appended a time stamped capture to the note.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/69295e6660.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This folder started to fill up with all sorts of things. Quotes, ideas, web clippings, photos and any number of random things. I became quite obsessed with saving things, but I am sure you can already see where this was going. I was absolutely dedicated to saving things in my new commonplace book, but I never went back and looked at it. Never browsed the notes for any other reason than vaguely remembering saving a quote I wanted to reference in some writing.</p>
<p>The digital folder was a great idea, but it was tucked away. It wasn’t in front of me to be able to look at, flick through and review the entries in it. Although I have confidence, some snippets saved would have been used at some point though searching my phone — I just didn’t get any use from it. It became obvious quickly that the whole point of a commonplace book, for me at least, was physically writing things in it.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-book-instead">A Note Book Instead</h2>
<p>OK, I am a little <a href="/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html">obsessed with notebooks</a> at the moment. Since reviewing my plan for 2023, and reading <a href="/2023/01/13/finished-reading-the.html">Revenge of Analogue</a>, I’ve adopted more manual processes. This means writing more with a pen and paper, as well as being aware of the enjoyment gained from tactile things. I even bought a mechanical keyboard, clicky!</p>
<p>So, my journal evolved into a commonplace book. There’s a certain level of worry that comes with even mentioning that you have a commonplace book. Most of the questions I see online are variations of “what do I write in this thing” and these exact questions come whenever you get out your notebook. You have to be prepared for this and answer them with confidence. The practice has existed for hundreds of years, and will do long after you are gone, so don’t worry.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dbb431be3b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Oh, and much like with the digital notebook, the answer to what you write in it is <strong>everything</strong>. While these practices make me much more satisfied in a sensory sense, it isn’t perfect. The fact that everything is written down manually, means that you lose all the advantages that digital note bring. They are not searchable and take up physical storage space.</p>
<p>I tried out <a href="/2023/03/17/indexing-a-used.html">indexing one of my notebooks</a>, using a tag system to allocate areas in which they may be stored if I were to use the <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/12-steps-to-build-a-second-brain/">PARA system</a> for <a href="/2023/04/06/finished-reading-building.html">Building A Second Brain</a>. Given that I never referred back to it ever again in that way, I didn’t bother with the next couple of notebooks I have used. I tend to flick through them and pick up ideas and thoughts as and when I need to. This serves as a nice reminder, a diary of sorts, but also a way to review information to help with memory recall. Thats a Win/Win in my (note)book.</p>

     <p>At the iPhone phone launch last September, a thought started to blossom in my head. As they presented all of their new devices, that no doubt they toiled away for months to create, I couldn’t shake the feeling of melancholy. Sure, they are nice and everything, but we might just have reached the pinnacle of what Apple&rsquo;s current technology can offer.</p>
<p>The truth is, collectively we realised this with smartphones at least a couple of years ago. The iPhone 13, was mostly the 12, that in turn was a more square version of the iPhone 11. You can track the slow and steady ticking forward of the Apple iPhone from the very first one, but what’s inside and what it can actually <em>do</em> tended to take strides forward at least every other year. Now, not so much.</p>
<p>There is a limit to what can be achieved from a rectangle of glass and metal, and there’s something to be said for Apple&rsquo;s consistency instead of Samsungs spaghetti at the wall approach. Unfortunately, for Apple, the downturn in creativity and technology improvement is also shaping into other devices. I’m not kidding either, Apple Watch, iPad, AirPods, MacBook, they are all pretty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meh">meh</a> - and thats a good thing.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0caeebeeb3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="you-cant-do-real-work">You Cant Do Real Work</h2>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s most contentious device, the iPad Pro, is the perfect example. There has been very little need to upgrade your device since 2018. The current model features very little upgrade past a more powerful processor, making it a little <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipad/ipad-pro-faq/ipad-pro-11-inch-3rd-gen-12-9-inch-5th-gen-2021-performance-comparison.html">better on battery and more able</a>. Which is great, until you realise that most things you do on your iPad don’t even tax older iPads. The only thing that has changed a lot is the camera if that&rsquo;s your thing (it really shouldn’t be).</p>
<p>The same can be said for Apple silicone MacBooks. The launch of the M2 MacBook Pro went by with none of the clamouring that the M1 Pro devices got. The tick that had followed the massive tock of desktop devices leaves very little need to upgrade depending on your use case. The M1 Pro powered MacBook that I do all of my work on still feels like it has headroom in every task I throw at it.</p>
<p>So, we’ve rubbished the upgrades for what’s in your hand, and potentially what’s in your bag, now let’s look at the Apple watch. A device that, once Apple sorted out what they wanted it to be, hasn’t seen a meaningful upgrade in years. Each year, the device gets a little faster and a little better on battery, but you’d have to jump up from a device 3–4 years old to see any improvements. Even then, the argument could be made that it wouldn’t really mean a lot.</p>
<p>Whilst presenting the newest version last year, almost each proposed upgrade covered could be attributed to software improvements, many of which would be rolled into older devices anyway. Thank god for the Apple Watch Ultra, <a href="/2022/11/18/apple-watch-ultra.html">one of my favourite devices</a> for a few years, for at least a little excitement. I have a feeling that many purchases, my own included, were fuelled by the desire simply for something new.</p>
<p>I do think this is the right move though. No one wants to be updating their watch every year, and by providing even smaller updates there is less desire to, and less for Apple to shout about. Apple does indeed make devices more aimed towards periodic upgraders than early adopters. Those that get a free phone with their new plan every 2–3 years, rather than us hardcore upgraders.</p>
<p>Apple doesn’t make devices like it used to. We can&rsquo;t fit them on a table as Steve Jobs said they should do, and they don’t always appeal to everyone. The devices are at the peak of what is a feasible upgrade, and that is becoming less and less about headline features. There’s less to crow about but more to love, the devices have peaked and that&rsquo;s fantastic for all users, and our bank balances.</p>

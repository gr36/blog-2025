  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As much as people try and convince me otherwise, since the iPhone 6 I just cant use my phone without a case on. The rounded corners and slippery materials leave me with too much worry that my phone will drop to the floor at any moment. I’ve tried loads of cases, from dirt cheap to surprisingly expensive – but stuck with an Apple version as it simply fit and feels the best. This isn’t <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-12-29-lopie-sea-island-review/">set in stone though</a> so when Jisoncase offered to send me their leather case for my iPhone X I jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>I opted for the saddle brown version to <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-06-21-Jisoncase-ipadpro-review/">compliment my iPad case</a>, and they both arrived in packaging that didn’t befit something so reasonably priced. Unlike the £50 Apple leather cases that supliments the £1000 you paid for the phone, the Jisoncase version is priced at just £19.95. At a price point comparative to a middle of the road silicone case, this one feels like you paid much more.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="2018-06-22-jisoncase-iPhonex-side-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/64ca66ba48.jpg" alt="2018 06 22 jisoncase iPhonex side 1" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<p>The leather is complimented by hard inlays for the volume and power buttons. It’s hard to say if this is metal or plastic but they fit very well and give a reassuring click when used. Tactile feedback is something I didn’t expect, most others in this price range often neglect the buttons. Leaving users to experience mushy button mashes that you’re not entirely sure if it worked or not.</p>
<p>The quality of leather has also been surprising high. Admittedly it doesn’t feel as soft and supple as that adorning high priced cases, but it has worn very well in the few weeks I have been using it. I do think that leather cases look much better with a little wear on them, but a quick wipe with a cloth to take these review pictures and it looks good as new again!</p>
<p>My only criticism would be the logo across the back. This could be personal preference here, but I’m not entirely happy having Jisoncase across the back of my phone. A subtle Apple it is not, more like a tramp stamp across the rear of a very expensive purchase. This is of course a minor issue given the quality of the case for a very reasonable price. The case is available in saddle brown as pictured above, but also black, blue and red. For the a fraction of the price of an Apple case, this is a bargain – grab one from <a href="http://www.jisoncase.com/iphone-x-genuine-leather-slim-case-ipx05a_p0059.html">Jisoncase website</a>, <a href="https://de.aliexpress.com/store/product/Jisoncase-Leather-Case-for-iPhone-X-Case-Cover-Genuine-Leather-Luxury-Brand-Slim-Anti-knock-Back/339855_32834930108.html?spm=a2g0x.12010612.0.0.2d973e5dvBNQLV">Aliexpress</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2usrzY5">Amazon</a></p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>For years the thoughts and rumours of iMessage on Android has been floating around. Depending on who you are listening to you get every response from “never going to happen” to “Apple need to do it”. I have often been dismissive of this ever happening, but more recently I think it could work and really should be something that Apple work on.</p>
<p>One of the arguments given is the fact that Apple already provide an Apple Music app on Android. Although this may be a left relic of Beats Music, it gives more of a reason for families to sign up for Apple Music, and even of they don’t want their kids using expensive iPhones, they can still stream music on any handset they are given. More family plans sold means more revenue for the services group and more growth to report to Wall Street.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">While this is a nice thought, the reality is that iMessage isn’t just messaging anymore. It’s a platform. Difficult to wrap my head around how they’d accomplish this at this point. <a href="https://t.co/dqkyA0SnQv">https://t.co/dqkyA0SnQv</a></p>
<p>— Zac Cichy (@zcichy) <a href="https://twitter.com/zcichy/status/1011155940257615872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
</figure>
<p>One of the huge arguments against is the fact that iMessage is often the glue that keeps people returning to iPhone when it’s time to upgrade their phone. They don’t want to leave the group chats and become a green bubble. If iMessage were provided on Android, users may be less likely the buy the new iPhone and more likely to switch to Android. Less sales of iPhones means less income for Apple.</p>
<p>Let’s take both of those arguments and consider the following. Apple provides iMessage on Android, a way for users of Android to message each other and iPhone users, end-to-end encrypted. It over night provides one of the best messaging platforms that can be used universally and freely to anyone.</p>
<p>During the last few updates to iOS, Apple have been turning iMessage into a sudo social network. A place for people to send stickers, play games, send money to each other – and in iOS12 jump into a group FaceTime call in a few taps. Apple should provide a stripped down version of iMessage on Android, a kin to the version on Mac, and let the extra features sell themselves. I believe the ability to join in with a group chat but not all of the Animoji fun and FaceTime calls would actually push more users to adopt an iPhone next time they are upgrading.</p>
<p>Android users would be included in the group chats and messages that iPhone users are, but not all the extras. Users are free to use whatever platform they choose, so don’t feel excluded but still don’t receive the full experience. How many group chats are taking place on WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger simply because not everyone uses an iPhone? Could the potential for extra sales exist if they are introduced to things like Animoji and iMessage game without the sales pitch. I believe now is the time to push forward to a universal platform and let the benefits shine through.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>esterday was a nice warm day in the UK, so I decided the tan mark from my Apple Watch could use a bit of help fading. Instead of strapping it on my wrist first thing in the morning I left it on the stand. This is the first time I I haven’t had it attached to me for a long time, and it it has highlighted a huge problem with the Activity app.</p>
<p>You see, I had my iPhone in my pocket the whole time. It recorded my 6000 steps around the farm park, yet when I open the Activity app it’s as if I’ve been asleep all day. Only when I strapped on my watch to go for a run did the activity app register that I had actually moved at all. I love my Apple Watch, I wear it constantly but I shouldn’t fell like I HAVE to have it on to register my activity.</p>
<p>I can’t understand why all the information isn’t transferred from Apple Health. If a user inputs a workout in Apple Health it appears in Activity so why not steps? Obviously there wouldn’t be any heart rate data to show, but it should be pretty easy to work out my standing time with the data gained form my iPhone, It’s pretty easy to work out that my watch is sat still and my iPhone is moving.</p>
<p>Perhaps every situation isn’t suited to having a watch on. There are no doubt many instances where people simply don’t want a watch on, but want to still record all the activity they have been doing.</p>
<p>The Activity app has ‘gamified’ my workouts and made me much more motivated to move just that little bit more. Apple could make a huge move in this direction and enable all sorts of accessories to transfer data into the service and encourage even more people to get moving. Yet Activity ONLY shows up when you pair an Apple Watch and I cant help but feel millions of users are missing out.</p>
<p>How many people would move more if their Fitbit enabled competition with anyone they knew with an iPhone not just other people with a Fitbit. All of the data is collected in Apple Health – so make every step a competition and get more people moving.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>For as long as I have been using an iPad as my main computer I have struggled with where to keep it. I have never been a fan of many case designs as they often add a lot of weight which makes holding an iPad much more difficult. Couple this with the fact a case is pretty much redundant while in use, it’s usually in my hand or being used propped up in the Smart Keyboard, there simply hasn’t been anything to fill the void.</p>
<p>So when Apple introduced leather sleeves with the 10.5 inch iPad Pro I was interested to see if they would work – but at £130 it was far to much money to simply test one out. Thankfully as with everything made over the last few years, it has been reproduced at a much more acceptable price point – introducing the Jisoncase iPad Pro Case. All the features, but at a considerable saving and I’ve been trying one out for a couple of weeks – here is my review.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Design And Usage</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The case fits the iPad Pro and pencil snuggly inside, it is reassuringly fitted to the design and offers pretty good protection from everything other than a very high drop. It pretty much copies the official Apple design with real brown leather that is lined with soft material on the inside. Meaning not only is your iPad going to be protected, it’s going to be dusted off while inside the case and more importantly you’re going to look good carying it.</p>
<p>The cover is also available in black or red, but I opted for the brown colour to match my other brown peripherals. The leather, although not as high quality as more expensive cases, appears to be wearing very well – although a bit of wear and tear makes a leather case look much better in my opinion. So I am actually looking forward to it appearance after a few months of use. I am much more comfortable putting my iPad into my bag knowing it has more a little more protection.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-06-21-jisoncase-desk2-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/577d572c14.jpg" alt="2018 06 21 jisoncase desk2 1" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<p>I was initially very sceptical about using the case, and put off a little due to the sung fitting, but after a few days of use the case provided a great deal of protection given the amount of traveling I do. Thankfully there is also a slot to store an Apple Pencil, seeing as I have already lost two, this should hopefully make sure I know here it is and it is protected. Unfortunately it isn’t all good news because I cant use it with the Smart Keyboard.</p>
<p>Unlike other cases there is absolutely no chance of fitting an iPad in with Smart Keyboard attached. I can just about wedge it in with enough effort, but this just isn’t practical. I presume the leather will stretch over time, but when compared to simpler cases on the market I really shouldn’t have to stop using the keyboard when I want to put it in a case. I considered getting an occasional keyboard, however as great at the case is, given my <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-02-19-one-year-ipad-computer/">usage and the amount of work I do on my iPad</a> I can not justify making changes to my workflow just to use this case.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Conclusion</strong></strong></h2>
<p>I am not really sure where this now fits in, I use the Jisoncase iPad Pro Case a small amount when at home, but without storage for my keyboard the usage when traveling has stopped. If you use just the iPad and Apple Pencil (<a href="https://twitter.com/gr36/status/997016619477069826?s=21">which according to my poll</a> quite a few people do) then this is the case for you. Great quality, nice looks and protection can be found at a bargain price point.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Curbing screen time is very trendy in tech circles at the minute. There have been huge movements to <a href="https://www.tristanharris.com/">change app design</a>, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/change-your-screen-to-grayscale-to-combat-phone-addicti-1795821843">turn it black and white</a> and even calls for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/08/apple-investors-iphone-addiction-children">manufactures to step in</a> and stop people using them so much. So it was no surprise when Apple took to the stage, only a few weeks after Google i/o and launched pretty much the same thing. ScreenTime is a quintessential Apple response to outside pressure, a way to highlight the latest Silicon Valley worry – but it is hugely important people pay attention.</p>
<p>Taking its design inspiration from Apple Health, ScreenTime is built right into the setting of every iPhone that will run iOS12 (and that’s most of them). Displaying graphical data about app usage, notification tallies and even how many times you pick the device up – you could be forgiven for thinking it was a step too far. However Apple have found a very safe ground where there is no scolding no matter how much you use your device. No set amount for how you use the apps that are installed, simply well presented data that will hopefully make some users think about the things it shows.</p>
<p>No one thinks it is Apples (or manufactures) place to tell you how you should use a device, but I am so happy that at last there is coherent data people can see. If this sparks a change in usage, they can be guided to a healthier way of life. For far too long I have overheard awkward conversations from average people trying to explain to others just how much they are using their phone. Finally the place exists to show them, a place to send them to look into where they are spending their time and leave the decisions up to them.</p>
<p>Time is a metric you never get back. Time is something we all know we need to make the most of, return the most value from it. I’m not advocating that every one works harder, or that everyone starts jumping from planes or becoming hedonists – but value is a very personal thing and users can now make the decision themselves. If they take away great value from engaging on Twitter for 4 hours a day – brilliant, that is great to hear. If they take great pride from being the person that everyone communicates with so recieve 500 iMessages a day – again perfect. Yet at its very core ScreenTime provides an almost real time view of how much of it is spent on a device and offers a few tools to help, should you decide to cut down.</p>
<p>Along with improvements to Do Not Disturb and notification handling Apple are moving into a very unique place. They make a serious amount of money from selling you the device, but also from the apps you purchase from the store. They do not profit from your personal data nor the level of engagement you have with a device. Google however – Do.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It’s become a bit of a running joke amongst my tech friends. A personal meme that I keep repeating the same sort of phase when questioned about a whole range of topics. Anything from GDPR to Social Media harassment my answer – [micro.blog}().</p>
<p>Many people don’t understand. I’ve tried and failed to explain why micro.blog matters in a world of Twitter, Facebook and countless blogging platforms. A few have converted and love it, and a few have tried and given up (and <a href="https://darylbaxter.micro.blog/">given me some stick</a>. My biggest take away from all the jokes is that the platform is not for everyone and that’s ok.</p>
<p>This post started off as a bit of a joke, but there is a sensible point in here somewhere. We all preach about things that we love, hell most of Twitter is people doing exactly that. It may be the latest bit of technology you’ve bought and think everyone should have one. It might be your choice of religion and you want to express all of the benefits it will give you in this life and the next. Or it might just be a new(ish) publishing platform that gets you <a href="/2018/05/25/intentional-twitter-usage.html">away from social media</a> a little and gives you a place to publish the writing that doesn’t quite make it to your blog.</p>
<p>Remember when I thought Medium was the best thing since sliced bread, that lasted quite a while and look how that ended up! You are all just going to have to weather the storm until I find something else to get obsessed with. I’m sure there is a start up out there planning to “make a difference to the world” and they should be along shortly.</p>

<p>There are several narratives that exist through my blog posts. Productivity <a href="https://gr36.com/apps">apps</a>, <a href="https://gr36.com/workflows">Workflows</a> and me trying to quit social media. The latest news in accordance with the latter, is trying to use Twitter more intentionally and it’s working very well.</p>
<p>We’ve all been there. Standing and a queue, waiting for something, or just generally any moment where or lives aren’t rushing along – the first reaction is to pull the phone out and start scrolling through an app. Mine is <a href="https://twitter.com/gr36">Twitter</a>, I’ve been around there for years and there is usually something interesting going on to take my attention for a few minutes. Unfortunately the level of stress involved and the amount of negativity is really starting to get to not just me <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40545727/i-unfortunately-have-the-equivalent-of-5-phds-in-twitter-harassment">but many users</a>.</p>
<p>Quitting Twitter completely is just <strong>not</strong> an option for me (<a href="https://gr36.com/2018-01-20-building-a-micro-blog-on-jekyll/">I’ve tried</a>), I do get a lot of benefit from Twitter – I’ve met loads of really interesting people and started my <a href="https://www.byodpodcast.com/">Podcast</a> because of it. So the answer is to limit my exposure to things that affect me negatively. The perfect solution will not only cut down my usage of Twitter but alos stop this always present urge to pull out my phone at any moment of boredom.</p>
<p>Turning my notifications off mediated this somewhat, I am no longer poked to go back to Twitter by dings. I have never really viewed those notifications as important that need instant attention. The answer has been simply removing the app from my phone, I have drastically reduced my exposure to Twitter, and I really do feel better for it.</p>
<p>My Twitter usage is now restricted to when I want to ‘go and check’ Twitter on my computer. The downside is that I don’t reply to messages and mentions like I used to, and also my tweets will come in short bursts of quite a few in a short space of time. So I must apologise for the time line spam, however I will still continue to share things to Twitter using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/linky-for-twitter-and-facebook/id438090426?at=1000ltj4">Linky</a>, and posts to micro.blog will appear there also. I am not gone, just using Twitter far more intentionally and it has worked wonders.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?at=1000ltj4">Drafts</a> being around for ages, I am very new to using it for any length of time. I’ve already posted about my <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-04-29-finding-use-for-drafts/">love of the app after giving it a chance</a>, so I won’t go into that here but thought I’d share some of my most used and favourite actions.</p>
<h2>Send to Things</h2>
<p>I really don’t need to discuss my love of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?at=1000ltj4">Things</a> here again, do I? This action enables me to write multiple todos and pass them all to Things at once. Saves loads of time for planning a project or if you take meeting action notes like I do.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Cc">Install</a></p>
<h2>Post to Micro.blog</h2>
<p>The greatest thing about Drafts is the fact I start absolutely every bit of text in the app and then pass it to its destination. I start all writing here and if it is long enough or good enough I post to my blog, if not I use this action to post to micro.blog with ease.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Hg">Install</a></p>
<h2>Send To Bear</h2>
<p>My longer notes or <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-05-15-workflow-things-attachments-using-bear/">lengthy attachments to Things</a> todo items are stored in <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-01-19-bear-app-review/">Bear</a>. This action does exactly what it says, passes all text to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bear/id1016366447?at=1000ltj4">Bear</a> and creates a new note.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CZ">Install</a></p>
<h2>Post To My Blog</h2>
<p>Should the text I’m writing be deemed worthy I post it to my blog hosted on github using Jekyll. In order to do this it needs to have the correct front matter and then be pushed to github using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/working-copy/id896694807?at=1000ltj4">Working Copy</a>. This action does all of that in one tap. I have several of these for posting to different parts of my blog.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1GO">Install</a></p>
<h2>Covert To HTML</h2>
<p>I quite often write columns for <a href="http://eepurl.com/dvApEj">newsletters</a> or websites that require me to send it across in HTML. Or perhaps I just want to see what the page I’m building is going to look like. Whatever the reason this action turns markdown into HTML.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Eb">Install</a></p>
<h2>Do More..</h2>
<p>There are hundreds more that I could mention but these are my most used ones. Matt Birchler has also <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/draft-5-actions-the-birchtree-collection/">created some really good ones himself</a> and helped out with the post to micro.blog action above. Drafts has become my favourite app and does most of what I used workflow for. I’d love to know your favourite.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>I’ve made no secret that I have been crying out for the ability to add attachment to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?at=1000ltj4">Things 3</a>. I love the app but this is the only thing that is keeping me using <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-01-14-todoist-review/">Todoist</a>for work related reminders. I have tried loads of different options and work arounds, been <a href="https://twitter.com/syrinxstarman/status/995692751277645824?s=21">helped out along the way</a>, but could never find something good enough. This isn’t perfect but the best way is to use Bear to add files as attachments to Things.</p>
<p>Bear has a great implementation of file attachments to notes, you can clip pretty much anything you wish. The app will then show file links inline, allowing for other notes and attachments to be placed as desired. Thanks to the developers love of URL schemes you can then link to the note from Things. You can do all this manually but you came here for the Workflow!</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-05-15-workflow-things-attachments-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/69664ce76b.jpg" alt="2018 05 15 workflow things attachments 1" width="1000" height="498" border="0" /><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/2b23f20166734c06be30b71bb80f0d6f">Download the Workflow</a></p>
<p>This can be run from the today widget, provides the file picker, and once you’ve decided on your attachment it gets to work. The file name will be used for a note in Bear, and of course an item in Things with a link back to the note.</p>
<p>Despite the need for a work around it actually allows you to clip a few attachments and also make notes alongside for a pretty great experience. I have my fingers crossed for Cultured Code to add in attachments, but they seem adverse to adopting the feature.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://gr36.com/workflows">some of my other Workflows</a> I have shared over time, these are steadily increasing as I find and make more. If you need any help or want to try and achieve something with Workflow <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/workflow/">head over to the subreddit</a> and ask away.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>After <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-04-29-finding-use-for-drafts/">giving it some time</a> I am very happy with doing all my blog writing in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?at=1000ltj4">Drafts 5</a>. Unfortunately due to Workflow’s slowing updates, actions take ages to update and I have been stuck on a way to update my old <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-03-13-workflow-bear-and-things-ideas/">Bear for ideas Workflow</a>. Luckily using Drafts actions and the robust URL scheme I’ve been able to get this going again.</p>
<p>For this Workflow to work you will also need this <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Ib">Drafts 5 action</a>. The Workflow uses the url scheme to create a note using your chosen idea title and notes, and also run the above action. This copies the open note URL and the notes UUID to the clipboard, ready to be placed in a Things to-do item.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bb3ebafb36.jpg" alt="2018 05 15 drafts things idea 1" title="2018-05-15-drafts-things-idea-1.png" border="0" width="1000" height="498" /><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/22d2e29e5ddd46a9b1d04d723574a089">Download The Workflow</a></p>
<p>The Workflow will then create a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?at=1000ltj4">Things</a> item with the ideas title, and copy in a link to open the Drafts note with a single tap. Last but not least you will be returned to your Drafts 5 note ready to tap away if you wish.</p>
<p>As with every Workflow, you can customise this to your liking. If you don’t want to be returned to Drafts, simply deleted the last open URL action from the Workflow. I have also left out an reminder or due date on the Things item, although I like to add in a reminder for later that day just to give me a gentle push towards fleshing it out a little.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When speaking (over the internet of course) to Jeff Perry yesterday I realised a weird tendency I have to refer to ‘it’ wrong.</p>
<p>We were <a href="https://micro.blog/JeffPerry/10961046">conversing on micro.blog about Craft.do</a>, and I replied saying that “I just don’t get it”. The ‘it’ I was referring to is the hype around the app at the moment. I do understand the app, it seems really powerful and, to its part, fairly straight forward to get to grips with powerful features. I just find it very strange that some apps seem to go through these periods of evangelical usage and coverage that seem to spout from no where.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.craft.do">Craft</a> is the current hotness, it has a small period when it first came out too, <a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a> also has these periods of expansion where it appears that not only is everyone using it, everyone is talking about how they use it, and telling you to try it out. I find it interesting that some services seem to be able to cultivate these periods of growth that spark in all of us some form of FOMO. It is these periods that I don’t ‘get’.</p>
<p>I guess this is why influencers exist and marketing people are paid so much money for the work they do. Paid to create conversation around the app and motivate people to go and learn about the app and see if it is for them. There is a whole world out there of ‘set up’ videos and blog posts of people telling you why this app is the best things ever. There’s a weird world of productivity videos out there and <a href="https://gr36.com/a-new-productivity-app-wont-make-you-more-productive/">a new app rarely makes a difference</a> without a change in you.</p>
<p>Although I have been working really hard to limit my subscription expenditure due to fatigue. More often that I care to admit I get swept away in these waves and spend money far too easily on apps I no longer use a week later!</p>
<p>BTW: Awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8raOG7HXJoCUygx219fU4A">YouTuber Chris Lawley</a> has an upcoming video on Craft so make sure you’re subscribed to his channel if you do want to find out about it.</p>

  For most part of the 12 months I was eager to go back, but there has been a change in the last few months. I think it hit me too late that I have been without physical human interactions for so long.<br />
  I have now bundled down into myself which does not want to get exposed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I know this feeling well. I love working from home and I don’t want to go back to a place of work full time but I wonder if this isn’t going to be good for me long term.</p>
<p>I am both perfectly happy and lonely at the same time and it’s only if some checks on me that a state is observed.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Most writers started writing to please the search engines (later just one search engine). To feed the beast, more “original” content was needed. The sharing moved to social media and got lost with the ephemera. Writers burned out producing longer and longer posts for ad pennies over trust and community.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This has been playing on my mind recently and CJ sparked a thought in my head before it had formulated properly. I too love writing link posts, just taking a paragraph or two and expanding your thoughts on the subject. I’ve promised myself to write more of them, but I think many people view them as a cheap way to turn out content.</p>
<p>However this post prods me to wider thoughts about what to write. About pandering to algorithms and news feeds just to get clicks or views. It comes up <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisWilmshurst/status/1354736032835645443?s=20">time and time again</a>, and if you need the metrics you simply have no choice but to pander to the platforms and make the content that ranks.</p>
<p>But I am joining the ranks of those that refuse to write longer form posts just because, or sign up for courses on how to rank higher in algorithms. I want to write whenever and whatever I want, and so should you.</p>

     <p>Sending email newsletters from Ghost can be a daunting experience, especially if you have not done anything like this before. A big issue I have come across is the signup form not working for people trying to get set up. It either does nothing, or just spins and doesn’t set up a subscriber.</p>
<p>This is more than likely due to the email service and nothing you have done wrong. Emails are actually split into two types on Ghost so you might be able to send out a newsletter to thousands of people, but none of them are able to log in. The two types of emails sent by your Ghost install are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bulk – Your actual newsletter. So you can send test emails and posts out to all of your subscribers.</li>
<li>Transactional – These are everything else. Sign up emails, log in emails and everything else to do with memberships.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re having issues these areas are where to check.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-mailgun-api">Set Up Mailgun API</h2>
<p>Chances are you’ve already done this, most guides walk you through this part. Head into your Labs section, turn on Members and at the bottom under Email Newsletter settings paste in your Mailgun API and the domain you are using.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6fac857dfa.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>If in doubt click on the links under the boxes to head straight to the area you need in Mailgun. Don’t forget to change your region to EU if you have an EU flag next to your domain.</p>
<p>This will enable you to send all your ‘bulk’ emails.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-smtp">Set Up SMTP</h2>
<p>Depending on where you host your Ghost blog, this part may not be needed, however if your on <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/how-to-host-your-own-ghost-blog-on-digital-ocean/">Digital Ocean like me</a>, you’ll need to send your transactional emails by SMTP and not direct from your server.</p>
<p>SSH into your droplet and</p>
<pre><code>nano /var/www/ghost/config.production.json
</code></pre>
<p>Then copy in this code to replace the mail JSON item that is there already. Changing the “user” and “pass” to your own Mailgun details.</p>
<p>If you have a droplet in the EU change the “host” to your version.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">“mail”: {
“from”: “Your name ”,
“transport”: “SMTP”,
“options”: {
“service”: “Mailgun”,
“host”: “smtp.mailgun.org”,
“port”: 465,
“secureConnection”: true,
“auth”: {
“user”: “your_user_name”,
“pass”: “your_password”
}
}
},
</code></pre>
<p>Also set the email you want these transaction emails to appear from as this is different from your newsletter ones. An email address that is in use anyway is advisable to avoid spam filters.</p>
<p>This should allow you to send all of your transactional emails.</p>
<h2 id="check-domain-and-ssl">Check Domain And SSL</h2>
<p>This is the part that drove me crazy. I have set everything up and still my Ghost members subscribe from did not work. This was due to a miss match in the domain set up in my production.json. So head back into there:</p>
<pre><code>nano /var/www/ghost/config.production.json
</code></pre>
<p>And check right at the top where it says “URL” that this is https:// and not http:// if you are using SSL – which you will be.</p>
<pre><code>“url”: “https://YOURDOMAIN”,
</code></pre>
<p>Your sign up form should now be working correctly and you can start gaining subscribers!</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>This is the type of headline that usually sounds the alarms and announces shutting down a service. Thankfully this is quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Since <a href="/2021/01/28/i-didnt-want.html">moving my blog back to WordPress</a> I’ve been looking at what to do with my newsletter. It was the biggest sticking point that almost sent me back a step, but I am much happier posting to the indieweb. So I began looking around. The trendy <a href="https://www.getrevue.co">Revue</a> was an option however importing old issues was a Hughe issue. I settled eventually on the place where everyone else is – Substack.</p>
<p>As time went on and I got things set up, I just couldn’t get comfortable with this. There is nothing wrong with the service, and loads of people use it happily. I just have a few worries about services giving things away for free, they always eventually have to recoup it somewhere (looking at you Medium). There also is no way to turn off tracking, another thing I am not comfortable with. As such I just didn’t want to get invested in a service that I wasn’t 100% on.</p>
<p>So I built my own version. <a href="https://email.gr36.com">Greg Thinks Things</a></p>
<p>This will make it easier for signing up, viewing old versions and means I can keep control of everything from start to finish. No tracking, no third parties – just me and you like an email should be.</p>
<p>If you’ve subscribed already nothing changes. The emails will come to you from my personal email address and you can just email me back if you want to get in touch. I’m looking forward to sending the next one so if you’ve not signed up already there is no better time to do it.</p>
<p>Also my membership is no more. Thank you to all those that have been contributing, the money had 100% gone towards hosting. I will look at options to offer a paid service with perks I the future depending on how things go.</p>

<p>A million times this. I have lost count of the number of people that lose themselves and their personality online.</p>
<p>It’s not just about creatives, although this quote is talking directly to them – “link in bio” – it’s about being yourself. I’m guilty of this recently and it’s a big reason I pulled away from social media. You become a voice of whatever it is your peddling. Be it your content, your workplace or even just yourself.</p>
<p>Losing personality and approachability loses the whole reason for being social in the first place. We’ve spoken about it being <a href="https://gr36.com/not-being-a-fan-boy-is-hard/">hard to not be a fan boy</a>, but being one for yourself is a terrible place to end up.</p>

<p>I don’t have many apps installed at all and always keep my homescreen icons down to a minimum. Widgets are becoming much more useful so I have quite a few in the side page, but only ever a couple on my actual homescreen for information I need in my face.</p>
<p><em>Note: I have no idea where I got the wallpaper from so it’s not fair of me to share without credit. If I do ever find it again I’ll update the post.</em></p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s said a bad workman always blames his tools. An old saying yes, but it’s always clear when people feel responsible they look to shift the blame to other things. A faulty saw causing a wonky cut is one thing, but how about a smartphone ruining society?</p>
<p>It’s true that almost all the big players in mobile applications use some unsavoury tactics to keep you using them. Notifications, dark patterns and a number of dirty ticks all in the name of growth. Designed to get your data, spend your money or keep you engaged with whatever service it is that they are peddling. But here’s the thing, you still have a choice.</p>
<blockquote><p>Think about this phone. You can use this cellphone to gossip. You can use this cellphone to tell lies. You can use this cellphone to tell some really great jokes. You can use this cellphone to expose corruption, inequality, bad behaviour. What’s important is that we actively think about how we use it, how it affects our lives and our societies, and learn from it. – <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/mike-pondsmith-cyberpunk-2077/616924/">Mike Pondsmith</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Can you class a smartphone as a tool? It certainly helps you get things done. Helps you achieve the goals that you want it too. Stay connected, be productive or snap the photos you want to snap — but to be truly a tool, it shouldn’t require anything back from you.</p>
<p>My hammer doesn’t make a noise because I haven’t put many shelves up for the last few weeks. Outlook doesn’t pester me to send more emails. Tools ask nothing in return for their purpose. However, it’s really all about how you use the tool.</p>
<p>My iPhone doesn’t really ask much of me. I can <em>choose</em> to load apps onto it that allow me to communicate or I can load some that waste my time. That’s the choice we all can make, and some responsibility must lay at our feet. Even the apps that ‘waste our time’ are also tools to be used which ever way you see fit. Twitter enables real time communication to millions of people. Facebook has the best suit of communication apps we have ever seen, used for everything from peer support to psychiatry at a distance. Modern tools built from ones and zeros instead of wood and metal just need a little bit more moulding and a lot more will power.</p>
<p>With a little work we can <em>choose</em> to shape our tools to our own usage. Mediate the distractions they peddle and contain the downsides. Making the tools work for us as they should have done from the start.</p>

  All my life I have had the habit of liking the idea of things and not the thing itself.
</p></blockquote>
<p>How many of us want to be someone that does x but don’t want to actually do x. It could be writing, running or just being a happy person. It doesn’t matter what it is, the thought of it is often more enjoyable that the thing itself.</p>
<blockquote><p>

<p>The stories we tell of the things we do, the things we enjoy and the memories we have made are at the very core of life. Some TV shows are funnier when talking about them with your friends. Hardships something far more positive when recalling them after the event.</p>
<p>The stories are the very substance and the reason to do things.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p style="text-align: left">This is one of my most used Shortcuts now I have <a href="https://gr36.com/i-didnt-want-to-move/">removed posting friction</a> and settled a little. Shortcuts is a really robust way to publish to WordPress and not have to use the WordPress app or third party app.</p>
<p>
<p>This isn’t all of my work, and all the technical stuff was done by Tim Nahumck in his <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-4-siri-shortcuts-wordpress-and-more/">drafts review</a> it just needed updating and tweaking a little as Shortcuts evolves.</p></p>

<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3dc5536449a140ba92767041ad2608fb">Grab It</a></p>
<p>You can write a post in pretty much any app you have now. Use Markdown format though as the shortcut looks for # to set the title and removes all this for you. See my screen shots for an example of my Apple Notes publishing.</p>

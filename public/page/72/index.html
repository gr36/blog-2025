  How bizarre it would have seemed back then to learn that in the future your reading habits would not only be tracked forever by Big Tech, and thus available to any agent with a subpoena, but broadcast to the world in a variety of uncomfortable ways.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I am sure you all know my thoughts on tracking things. <a href="/2021/03/10/stop-tracking-random.html">I hate it</a>, unless it has a clear and transparent reason. The main point of the above post is to talk about being able to follow and consume whatever content you like, but this part stuck out to me.</p>
<p>Even just a few years ago the very idea of being tracked about what you do would be alien. No doubt it happened in some small instances, but by and large our lives where private.</p>
<p>Now we give up huge chunks of our private data either because we think <a href="/2020/08/18/your-privacy-is.html">it’s required</a>, or we do so willingly for the clout! There is nothing wrong with whatever data you choose to give up, that’s your choice, but how much of it is really needed and how much is collected just because it might be needed later. Kept in data centres we have no control over, just in case.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>In recent weeks I have been a bit of a restless soul. Moving things around despite my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/digital-consumerism-and/">insistence that you didn’t need to</a> do it. It’s been part of a long-running plan for me to straighten everything out and stop spreading myself too thin in projects, but I digress.</p><p>I’ve moved my hosting from <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/i-didnt-want/">Ghost to WordPress</a>, and now to Micro.blog. Despite <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/feed-worries/">a few hiccups</a> and me not being 100% happy there is a <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/im-still-frustrated/">certain freedom</a> that is felt by just posting everything to one place. This is by far the biggest reason I choose to jump ship so soon and put all of my posts in the same place.</p><p>Photos I would usually post to Instagram come here, status update posts like books I am readingcome here, and are combined with the rest of my writing. I’m not worried about where this goes and that goes. Moving things backwards and forward and breaking links — it’s all just here.</p><p>I have been on micro.blog <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/youre-not-cool/">for a couple of years</a>, it started as a way for me to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/using-microblog-aka/">quit Twitter in 2018</a>, but took until now for me to really get invested in it. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/bye-microblog/">rage-quit</a> a couple of times because I was frustrated in the offerings, but always returned. This time feels more real, and I’ve worked out what I want to do with my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/social-media-in/">content going forwards</a>.</p><p>Those few times I have quit mean I completely understand the frustrations people have with the service. It has a considerable barrier to entry, but this is somewhat intentional and somewhat freeing. You have to give up some notions you have on blogging, and let some things be dictated for you. You also need to learn a few bits of code to mould the site to make it yours (mine is months in the making of learning CSS and Hugo).</p><p>I could wax lyrical about my change in thoughts about my blog, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/asking-giving-and/">my frustrations</a> with never achieving what I wanted, and now my more <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/what-is-your/">personal content creation</a>. I am sure micro.blog, <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> and the excellent community have helped me with this transition. The people that use mb can be <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/this-is-how/">more than a little preachy</a>, because of these barriers to entry does attract an overwhelming ‘type’ of user, but I have had overwhelmingly positive experiences with people that makes it all worth it.</p><p>Everything will still be <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/cross-posting-to/">cross posted everywhere</a> I can, and I still check in to Twitter a couple of times a day (I can’t quit it as it’s my social media addiction) so nothing much really changes. I wrote this as a kind of explainer to myself more than anything else, but now I have <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/whats-this-for/">worked out what this is for</a> I just hit post and forget about it. Perfect.</p>

<p>To steal some inspiration <a href="https://world.hey.com/gabz/something-i-liked-this-week-2635f110">from Gabz</a> I wanted to write about my favourite Apple device I own. For which I own loads of them — Apple Watch, iPhone 12 Pro, iPad Pro, iMac Pro, MacBook Pro (Pro all the things) — but these pale in comparison to my absolute favourite AirPods Pro.<br />
<br />
Since I purchased the original version within minutes of them going on sale, AirPods have been my go-to headphones for almost all situations. Before which I’d had a long stream of different ones and had to keep several around for different activities. I had Bose QC35 for music, Beats X for the gym and different headphones for running. Although I still put on some <a href="/2019/08/20/powerbeats-pro-review.html">Powerbeats Pro</a> for long-distance running, the newer Pro AirPods replaced everything else with ease.</p>
<p>What has further cemented their place in my heart has been the recent pandemic. They are invaluable for video calls, long telephone calls and catching me up with my <a href="/2020/10/18/podcasts-and-me.html">podcast feed</a> whilst walking the dog.</p>
<p>They are not perfect, but there are. It many things to improve. To mirror Gabz thoughts I love the physical buttons on the Powerbeats Pro, but it would be impossible to feature these in the small design. In fact, I would be hard pushed to think of any major improvements that would push me to upgrade to a new version. Even the battery life has been great for me, although that is bound to start to drop as they get older.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/a067433daf.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Sure the <a href="/2020/10/25/iphone-pro-thoughts.html">iPhone 12 is great</a>, I quite <a href="/2020/04/22/using-an-ipad.html">like my iPad</a> but is easy to pick my favourite device, and it’s also perhaps the cheapest one I have.</p>
<p>When Apple talk about the Apple Watch as their most personal device, I’d have to also put my AirPods Pro in that category. They are never very far away from me, and even fit in that weird small pocket in my jeans, so I always know where they are.</p>

<p>Sometimes regular things to everyone else are overwhelming to others. Every time I try and explain how I feel to others they pooh-Pooh what I am saying because they don’t see an issue. That’s great to hear, but something has changed in me and I don’t want more of anything. I want less.</p>
<p>I want to know less, consume less and take in less information. I’m not built to have access to all of these people at once, and I can’t be trusted.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Yes. Unless you can’t tell I have moved my blog, <a href="/2021/01/28/i-didnt-want.html">again</a>. It’s now firmly rooted into micro.blog, and I’d like to say it’s made me happier. But you know me, I <a href="/2021/03/25/at-the-moment.html">worry</a> about almost everything at the minute and one of the biggest things I think abut is you!</p>
<p>Yep, you read that correctly. Readers. I can’t quite achieve where I want to get to with my micro.blog hosting, but I can get 90% of the way there. Links should be forwarded to the correct URL and the consumption of posts should be almost the same. The only thing I can’t fix is the RSS feed, it’s going to contain <a href="/2021/03/24/moved-all-of.html">all posts</a>, not just the important ones as before and of course I worry about that.</p>
<p>I want people to still follow me as before for whatever they want to read, but I am sure most people don’t want to have my random ramblings pushed to them all the time. I’ve sorted the main page to only contain important posts, but RSS subscribers might get a bit fed up.</p>
<p>When in reality I don’t owe anyone anything, and I really shouldn’t be bothered. I have never made any money out of this, and I am certain if people want to follow along they will find the <a href="/categories/main/feed.xml">correct feed in time</a>. Any new subscribers will be pointed toward this too, but little things like that always drive me nuts! Anyone know how to limit a Hugo RSS feed to a category? Because I can’t work it out!</p>
<p>Meanwhile I have ‘switched off’ the posts to the main feed in the hope I don’t annoy anyone. I’m sure I won’t, but if I do, let me know, and I’ll worry about it a bit more — or you can just put up with my ramblings.</p>

  Facebook is cigarettes… It’s Big Tobacco… They know its product causes harm and they keep minimizing the harm to keep selling product.

<p>As <a href="https://mariovillalobos.com/2021/03/12/am.html">Mario pointed out</a>, who brought this to me attention, there are 2 billion people addicted.</p>
<p>This is a perfect analogy. We know it’s bad for not only us personally, but also to society as a <em>whole</em>. Yet the addiction runs deep through the world. Of course nothing will ever happen to Facebook, it’s too popular, and makes too much money.</p>
<p>Maybe the best we can hope is that the people that do use it are a bit of an outcast and have to huddle around outside in the rain!</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In the middle of last year I was debating my surrounding technology, and 8 moths later I am still doing the same thing. Yet, this time, I <a href="https://gr36.com/my-set-up-and-want-for-more/">don’t want more from it</a>, I want less.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  My desire to make my set-up more is also contrasted to my need to make my computer more discreet. A more minimal approach to my office would make me much more comfortable, as well as win me some Instagram points! I don’t like a great big iMac stuck on my desk, so I am leaning more towards something like the LG Ultra Fine or an ultra-wide display which I could mount to a wall and also use with my Switch.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Whilst I want my set-up to deliver more, I want it to do so with as little intrusion as possible. Be flexible and work in many scenarios. Sounds like I am describing an iPad doesn’t it — sorry to disappoint. The iPad falls down at too many tools that I used to be an <a href="https://gr36.com/today-is-the-day-i-quit-the-ipad/">option any more</a>.</p>
<p>So, where to go, what to do? I have no idea. Since working from home, and ditching a few projects in my life, I have managed to slim down the amount of technology that I need around. Unfortunately, in contrast to this the time spent using a computer has increased tremendously due to working commitments that have taken over from personal projects.</p>
<p>There is something great about being able to just put a laptop away and its out of site, but WFH and needing a larger screen and a comfortable desk set up means this is also a no go. Thinking about the amount of room that technology takes up in my home, as well as my life is a scary thing. I want it to be less, but much like my desire to <a href="https://gr36.com/cant-go-back/">remove a smartphone</a>, it’s just never going to happen.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  At the same time, the internet is constantly disappearing. It’s a world of broken links and missing files—often because the people in charge cast things off on a whim. In 2019, MySpace lost 50 million music files and apologized for “the inconvenience.” Around the same time, Flickr started deleting photos at random. Even though many of Vine’s most unnerving or charming or “iconic” six-second videos have been preserved, its community was shattered when the platform was shut down.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of my big worries about where to publish to. I am always reluctant to get invested in somewhere that my content is because I just don’t want to loose it.</p>
<p>Tweets and random chat is nothing to be concerned about, but I have lost too much of my <a href="https://gr36.com/wheres-my-name-gone/">writing over the years to fools and their websites</a> to loose more to services shutting down or just misplacing it.</p>
<p>You can preserve site through the internet archive as much as you like, but it doesn’t get back the links and feelings that go with it. So making sure to preserve as many details about my digital life as possible is important to me, and one things I needed to make sure my writing app does. I have toyed with the idea of also backing this up in text documents with dates etc in them, but that just another long term project that I never get around too.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I question almost everything about my life. Constantly wondering about each and everything I do and many things that I come into contact with. It’s one of the best and worst things about my brain, and for the past few months I’ve been thinking a lot about what I do and what I enjoy. This has led me to important discoveries, like my love of gaming, but also some questions writing and publishing online.</p>
<p>You see, my blog doesn’t really have a thing. It’s not tech-based like it used to be. It’s not really about anything in particular, which I am not really fussed about. It’s a personal blog, people read the personal bits of and follow along if they want. What matters more is the publishing part, putting those words out there and not keeping them in my brain.</p>
<p>I figured a long time ago I didn’t need a ‘thing’. I’m not a brand, nor do I want to sell myself or anything that I produce. So the argument arises what exactly the websites, social media things and blog I have are for? With a certain level of <a href="https://gr36.com/where-does-this-go/">where does this go mixed in</a>?</p>
<p>So I am getting a bit stuck and where micro.blog fits in. At the minute it’s getting a bit left out because although I check in a few times a day I’m not really publishing anything to it like I used to. The photo challenge really made me appreciate where I post my things online but that seems to have fallen away again.</p>
<p>I am leaning more towards just cross posting everything into micro.blog and checking in for the social aspect. I’d like to get this to a stage where it is my only blog but I just can’t work the design or ability to a stage where I am happy with everything. Having <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/03/22/ulysses-with-microblog.html">Ulysses now publish to pretty much everywhere</a> after my <a href="https://gr36.com/looking-for-my-perfect-app/">exploration of writing apps</a> complicated things tremendously.</p>

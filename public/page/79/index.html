     <p>There are many things in life I am never happy with but my content production is the biggest one. I’m never quite happy with anything I design, build or publish and my blog is always top of this list!</p><p>After a year on ghost I was getting frustrated with having to use Ulysses to publish – nothing wrong with the app, but it’s another cost to publishing. And also wanted to make my work more open on the web. Ghost does not support indieweb things such as micropub, web mention or pretty much anything despite its tendency to pitch itself as for “independent publishers”.</p><p>I love Ghost for looking clean, running fast and allowing me to publish my newsletter from the same blog. There’s no tracking, no fuss and nothing to break – unless an update breaks my blog that is!</p><p>In order to remove any friction whatsoever WordPress is the best. I can publish through micropub, Shortcuts or any number of apps. In fact I’ve published this very post in Apple notes and published through Shortcuts on my phone. However it’s slower, older and has a tendency to break.</p><p>So I’ve built something that allows me to publish micro.blog posts to social media and also longer form things without any fuss. But I’ve lost control of my newsletter, it’s moved to <a href="https://gr36.substack.com">Substack</a> – which I’m not over the moon about but it’s not a massive deal.</p><p>I still almost just switched back to Ghost last night, I can’t bring myself to delete the droplet yet.

     <p>After denying it for quite a while, I succumbed to getting myself a third-party mouse, and you can’t buy anything other than the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/mx-master-review/">MX Master 3</a>. It’s more comfortable, more accurate and is packed full of power user features that allow you to mould its usage to your will. There is one small issue though, every so often an update comes around which causes the mouse to freeze and disconnect at random intervals — but here’s the fix.</p><p>If you have this issue, each time the MX Master 3 freezes up you will notice random Bluetooth devices connect and disconnect before disappearing. This happens at random intervals and lasts for anywhere between a few seconds up to a minute. All the time you will be unable to use the mouse. It looks something like this.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/626d5000f0.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>The issue stems from Apples use of hand off. An amazing feature that allows you to move seamlessly from device to device with minimal fuss — but also with a tendency to break things that don’t work with it. If you’ve got your mouse paired to more than one device using the same iCloud, Apple is trying to sync them across all of them and failing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="750" height="188" frameborder="0" src="https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-8335452151565777&output=html&h=188&slotname=5524743860&adk=3000940899&adf=1057741593&pi=t.ma~as.5524743860&w=750&fwrn=4&lmt=1636365897&rafmt=11&psa=0&format=750x188&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgregmorris.co.uk%2Fblog%2Fmx-master-freezing%2F&flash=0&wgl=1&dt=1636365896905&bpp=10&bdt=28&idt=58&shv=r20211103&mjsv=m202111030101&ptt=9&saldr=aa&abxe=1&cookie=ID%3D624289800618cd6a-2205bf5cdacc0058%3AT%3D1636364026%3ART%3D1636364026%3AS%3DALNI_MaK4ep4hjl4TBG5SsfZqenP5X_i-Q&prev_fmts=0x0&nras=1&correlator=7511213397426&frm=20&pv=1&ga_vid=2046011996.1636364022&ga_sid=1636365897&ga_hid=708583389&ga_fc=1&rplot=4&u_tz=0&u_his=2&u_h=1440&u_w=2560&u_ah=1415&u_aw=2560&u_cd=24&adx=277&ady=969&biw=1304&bih=1210&scr_x=0&scr_y=0&eid=31063355%2C31063361%2C31063426&oid=2&pvsid=580926662659406&pem=271&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fgregmorris.co.uk%2Fghost%2F&eae=0&fc=1920&brdim=80%2C150%2C80%2C150%2C2560%2C25%2C1319%2C1290%2C1319%2C1210&vis=1&rsz=%7C%7CeE%7C&abl=CS&pfx=0&fu=128&bc=31&ifi=2&uci=a!2&fsb=1&xpc=UsfMDdvhpv&p=https%3A//gregmorris.co.uk&dtd=237" allowfullscreen="true" data-google-container-id="a!2"></iframe></figure><p>The MX Master supports up to three devices with the click of a button, so I have no idea why iCloud is trying to do this, but they broke it nonetheless.

  Memberships are not about a money grab at all, they are about people being rewarded for their efforts, but also to know that people enjoy what they are putting out. Bloggers don’t always get page views; we don’t have subscriber counts or post likes – so these types of things help.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I wanted to try and get something back for the years I have put in. Granted many of them failing and kidding myself, but they are still years — tens of thousands of tweets, photos, podcast episodes and hosting all for free.</p>
<p>I longed to be supported and feel at least a little bit of validation. I am amazingly thankful for the people that contributed, but my membership failed. Getting no where near the response I expected form the people around me. My post reads still come from Google searches and not from social media.</p>
<p>Does that mean my efforts where in vain? I still got the enjoyment out of it. Typing away, editing away or just talking to people.</p>
<p>Would I do it again? Perhaps not.</p>

  All of this is very much making me think about giving Hey a try. Except for the fact that I don’t want an <a href="http://hey.com">@hey.com</a> email address.

<p>This was a big sticking point for me at the start. However I forward all my email to my hey email address and use the actual address very rarely. I only give it out to people I know and this helps with the spam coming through. I don’t love having to use their email address however, because their are a few times I need to send email as an <a href="http://gr36.com">@gr36.com</a> address – but thankfully these times are few and far between.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  So I want to stop some emails getting through to me, but also once I’ve dealt with an email I want it to get out of the way.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I would LOVE Hey to be inbox zero, however everything hangs around instead. There are really well thought out ways to save emails for later so I have no idea why the others don’t go from your inbox but it’s not a game changer for me.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’ll try to write about anything I try along the way, and hopefully, I can find a solution that fits my needs.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I get too much email, but thankfully using Hey has helped a lot. Its not perfect and I wish I habd looked at sane box before jumping in, but I’m excited to see where Chris gets to.</p>

  You don’t have to be a communist to appreciate the force of Marx’s observation: “The worker does not make use of the working conditions. The working conditions make use of the worker; but it takes machinery to give this reversal a technically concrete form.” Well, we may not work on assembly lines in factories as much as formerly, but I can’t help seeing the contemporary gymnasium, with its emphasis on training with machines, as a strange sort of nostalgia for that state: working out in lieu of… working
</p></blockquote>
<p>Will is a brilliant author, with a passion for walking and saving yourself the grind in more pointless pursuits. To be honest I don’t think I can ever see myself going back to a gym, but I don’t think my realisation is the same fit everyone.</p>
<p>Running on a treadmill and using a statuary bike is unfortunately all some people have access to. Running, or cycling around the streets of some cities needs to become a much easier and much safer pursuit – but I can see the ridiculousness of doing it at a gym.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  During lockdown, people were doing sit-ups, press-ups and even lifting weights in parks and other open spaces, but as soon as the gyms reopened, many disappeared back indoors. I really cannot understand this. To me, the most bizarre sight in the world is someone on a running or cycling machine, rather than running, cycling,

<p>I was hoping the community exercise that I saw in the spring and summer would continue, but I some people seem institutionalised to return to an indoor gym if they possibly can.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>For some reason I managed to miss all of the build up to this book despite Ready Player One being one of my favourite books. So catching this the day it was released was a rear period of excitement and hunger to get reading.</p>
<p>I held off until I have finished the book I was on, so reviews and criticism was already flying all over the internet by the time I turned the first page. Despite these I went straight in with an open mind, but a longing for it to be as good as RPO.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it isn’t. RPT isn’t a bad read, and well worth it for those longing for a new story but don’t expect it to capture your heart. All of the right pieces are in the right places, but for some reason it feels overplayed, padded out by about 30%, and manages to pull on non of the nostalgia strings it should.</p>
<p>I found myself skimming large parts of the text in an attempt for the plot to get to the point much quicker. Although the story is somewhat well rounded, it feels like a book written to be made into a movie due to its lack of detail in some elements of the story but in-depth nitpicking on the 80’s trivia.</p>
<p>Ready Player Two is well worth picking up and reading but does not hold a candle to the first book.</p>
<h3>Book Notes</h3>
<blockquote><p>that this invention has the power to drastically alter the nature of human existence. I think it could help humanity. But it could also make things even worse. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B08CGP9TJ7&amp;location=368">Location 368</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Drawing parallels between this and [[Project Human]] with Zichey and <a href="https://www.projecthuman.fm/show/2-rene-ritchie">Rene Richie</a>. This quote would not have stood out to me so much had I not just listened to this episode.</p>
<p>Leading to my post on <a href="https://gr36.com/people-think-about-stuff/">Do People Actually Think About This Stuff?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>agree that everyone should balance their time in the OASIS with equal time in reality. But it’s not our place to mandate how our users live their lives. Growing up in the stacks would have been hell for me if I hadn’t had access to the OASIS. It literally saved my life. And I’ve heard Aech say the same thing.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B08CGP9TJ7&amp;location=803">Location 803</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>My online life is very similar. It has been the saviour of myself so many times that I cant even give attribution to them all. The amount of awesome people I have met is crazy high, yet social media is the worst, most toxic place I have even been.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, I knew the haters’ opinions were utterly meaningless, and had no effect whatsoever on our real lives. Unless, of course, we let it. Which, of course, I did. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B08CGP9TJ7&amp;location=1033">Location 1033</a>)</p></blockquote>
<h2>Social Media as a great filter</h2>
<blockquote><p>was even beginning to wonder if the invention of a worldwide social network was actually the “Great Filter” that theoretically caused all technological civilizations to go extinct, instead of nuclear weapons or climate change. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B08CGP9TJ7&amp;location=1065">Location 1065</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this is a fascinating idea, the other civilisations got to sage where they developed social media and it caused the death of their society too. I wonder how this fits into Dunbars number? Could it be that we are simply no meant to be able to talk and interact with so many people that the thoughts and ideas spreading will eventually ruin the world? This is a bit too real currently!</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe every time an intelligent species grew advanced enough to invent a global computer network, they would then develop some form of social media, which would immediately fill these beings with such an intense hatred for one another that they ended up wiping themselves out within four or five decades. Only time would tell. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B08CGP9TJ7&amp;location=1067">Location 1067</a>)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“Some people define themselves by railing against all of the things they hate, while explaining why everyone else should hate it too. But not me. I prefer to lead with my love—to define myself through joyous yawps of admiration, instead of cynical declarations of disdain.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B08CGP9TJ7&amp;location=1588">Location 1588</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>If only more people, myself included at time could lean into this. Even this books reviewers should have studied this passage a little better. Life is not for explaining why things are wrong all the time, it’s for enjoying the take away and the little things you <em>do</em> enjoy.</p>
<blockquote><p>The mind is the only thing about human beings that’s worth anything. Why does it have to be tied to a bag of skin, blood, hair, meat, bones and tubes? No wonder people can’t get anything done, stuck for life with a parasite that has to be stuffed with food and protected from weather and germs all the time. And the fool thing wears out anyway—no matter how much you stuff and protect it! —Kurt Vonnegut Jr. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B08CGP9TJ7&amp;location=5681">Location 5681</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>This might be the fact I am playing CyberPunk at the moment but reading back on these things makes me draw parallels to all sorts of things. Synthetic modifications to our biology is only a matter of time and could draw into questions what exactly a human is because we could begin to steer very far away from homosapiens. Certainly <a href="https://tim.blog/2020/10/27/yuval-noah-harari/">Yuval Noah Harari</a> believes so.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>In a broad sense of the word I understand the need for answers, but this need in modern times seems to be one of the most dangerous things around. In a world that contains a virus killing thousands of people every day, conspiracy theories are ravaging the planet and causing irreparable harm.</p><p>People have always created stories to try and explain away things that they do not understand. In older times attributing things to god or gods, but in more modern times these attributions have been replaced by arguably something more crazy. Everything from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-53416247">the pricing of furniture</a> to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html">names of fast food restaurants</a> seems to be a hint at an organisation pulling the strings of everything, and it’s getting a little ridiculous.</p><p>Unfortunately according to research, we just can’t help it. The human brain is hardwired to find patterns in everything, and as a reward when we find such a pattern our brain releases Dopamine. The same chemical released at more pleasurable times, and one that is easy to become <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/dopamine-addiction">addicted to</a>.</p><blockquote><em>The pleasurable feeling that our explanation is the right one—ranging from a modest sense of familiarity to the powerful and sublime “a-ha!”—is meted out by the same reward system in the brain integral to drug, alcohol, and gambling addictions. —</em><br /><br /><em><a href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/our-brains-tell-stories-so-we-can-live">Robert Burton</a></em></blockquote><p>Anthropologically it makes sense for us to be able to quickly and easily identify patterns to cut down the time we need to recognise things. Once you’ve noticed a dangerous animal, different parts of your brain will work together to process what you’re seeing and recognise it easier going forward. Our brain then leans into a false positive bias because it’s better for us to run from something that could have been a danger but isn’t, then spend time confirming it.</p><p>It’s uncomfortable for us to not understand what we are seeing or what is going on. Just as building and understanding a pattern leads us to a reward, the reverse is true, faulty patterns or confusion leads our brain to diminish that dopamine release we crave. When you look at conspiracy theories biologically, trying to explain away strange things happening, or building up a whole narrative to explain vague predictions, is completely natural.</p><p>Creating stories for ourselves and, now we have platforms to do so, sharing them with others is the “narrative equivalent of correlation” according to Robert Burton. “It is easy to understand why our brains seek out stories (patterns) whenever and wherever possible”.</p><h2 id="telling-our-stories-to-our-community-helps">Telling Our Stories To Our Community Helps</h2><p>We feel compelled to tell stories, even incomplete ones, as if they are the truth — because we believe that they are. Too hungry for the dopamine hit that we not only get from creating the story but also the validation from others, we overlook contradictory information even in the face of opposing proof.</p><p>That social aspect of retelling these stories is also as dangerous due to our need for others to validate both our survival and our happiness. Validation from others for the stories we tell releases an important chemical in our brain for feeling safe and welcome. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_J._Zak">Paul J. Zak</a> published research to suggest that Oxytocin, released when we are shown kindness and feel welcome, plays a key role in whom we believe we can trust. Some research <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_J._Crockett">also suggests</a> that Oxytocin plays a role in gloating and bias against other groups.</p><p>Creating possibly the perfect storm for our brains. Not only do we receive reward for creating stories, we also have a tendency to disbelieve those that appose them and only trust those that validate us. In these modern times of curated feeds and group recommendations it’s not hard for us to find a welcoming community, one that strives to explain away the world to us. What possible reason is there to test our theories when they are validated for us from the people we trust?</p><h2 id="cult-like-behaviour-is-easy">Cult Like Behaviour Is Easy</h2><p>Issues like these have existed forever. In-pre internet times the stories we had were explained to us by our family, or people in positions of power to keep us safe. In modern times it’s easy to find a connection and find some importance in the world. It’s even more exciting when the pattern you crave to understand is apparently being hidden from everyone, yet you’ve solved it!</p><blockquote>What a movement such as QAnon has going for it, and why it will catch on like wildfire, is that it makes people feel connected to something important that other people don’t yet know about — Cult Expert Rachel Bernstein</blockquote><p>In a time when there is more information available to the general population than ever before, we find ourselves with large portions of the population disbelieving proven facts and sharing stories that are false. With social platforms pretending they don’t understand the issues at play. Humans already have a tendency to stick together with people that trust and share common interests, and cult like behaviour is bred by those platforms seeking to increase engagement on their service without much care for consequences.</p><p>We are becoming increasingly aware of the effect that social platforms have on the spread of cult like behaviour, yet it starts clearly with natural processes. In large numbers we are often quick to dismiss those who believe something difference as lacking intelligence. When in fact creating or believing in conspiracy theories has no link to intelligence. In fact, those with a high recorded IQ can explain away information that disagrees with them more easily and rid themselves of the discomfort that comes from conflicting information.</p><blockquote>“Tell him you disagree and he turns away. Show him facts or figures and he questions your sources. Appeal to logic, and he fails to see your point … Suppose that he is presented with evidence, unequivocal and undeniable evidence, that his belief is wrong: what will happen? The individual will frequently emerge, not only unshaken, but even more convinced of the truth of his beliefs than ever before.” — Stanley Schacter</blockquote><p>A cognitive behaviour know as Motivated Reasoning is linked to how, in the face of often overwhelming evidence to the country, individuals can remain steadfast in their belief. Over the last few decades people have been convinced to <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/11/14/o-guru-guru-guru">leave everything behind</a> and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown">kill their whole community</a> by those telling compelling stories.</p><p>Stories we are addicted to discovering and reaping their dopamine reward. Stories that can lead us down paths never taken, and some that are now out of control.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Whilst writing some daily thoughts out I have recently been trying to formulate where my Social Media presence is going in 2021. Setting goals in what to achieve regarding blog posts, videos and all sorts of things is all well and good, but the web, and Twitter specifically, is where I spend frankly ridiculous amounts of time. I’ve been there for <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36">11 years and tweeted more than 38,000 times</a> (not any more they are all gone). About what I can only shed some vague guesses but every time I see those figures I really start to wonder why.</p><p>Why is it that I feel the need to share my life with others online, and especially on Twitter, a platform aimed at following people you don’t really know very well at all. To be honest looking from the outside, and really taking stock, it’s hard to understand why any of us share anything on Social Media. The platforms must have built such a homely atmosphere that makes us all feel so comfortable we share intimate and personal details on to a web that is often open, relentless and at points unforgiving.</p><p>Posing this question on Twitter is met with the warm and fuzzy replies you would expect from people that are ingrained in the platform, but every now and again I just can’t help but question myself. Why do I believe that other people, with equally busy lives, need to read what I am doing, reading, watching and sometime even eating? I have tweeted more things in the past 11 years than times I have updated my family what I am up to. In fact, I would never share most of what I tweet into more personal avenues.</p><p>Sharing based on those more personal networks makes sense. Facebook exploded by piggybacking on connections existing in the real world. Posts became a digital extension of your real identity and personality because it really was.</p><p>You became Facebook friends with your real life connections allowing them to see into your everyday life. But as the Facebook population grew to billions — your friends list grew to include family members, co-workers and that friend of a friend you thought was cool but turned out to be a bit racist — it all gets a bit much. Managing expectation can be exhausting and curating a feed that entertains but is also varied. With all these on your friends list you are expected to have one identity, one digital face that is a recreation of your normal life.</p><p>Having one identity and sharing to those close to you, well, at least a bit closer, has now devolved back to more personal networks. iMessage and WhatsApp groups are the new normal points of contact for the self-expression when you are not meeting in person. With no need to mediate your online work, or create a <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/finsta">Finsta account</a> because your parents are on Facebook. As well as Twitter, Snap Chat and whatever else the new hotness is.</p><p>You see, Social Media in its current form feels like the old web. A small evolution from bulletin boards, without the anonymity, but asking much more from you. Based on old ideas and clinging to the importance by the smallest of threads by putting more and more services into their apps. Starting as the place where everyone you knew hung out online, but devolving into <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="/2020/09/01/the-trickle-down.html">attention seeking contests that demand more and more of your time</a>.</p><p>Twitter feels too flat and rigid in its approach to Social Media. It’s less personal than it really should be in the world we live in. People follow me for no doubt the tech stuff, but get switched off by my other interests and personal posts. I constantly find interesting people to follow, and then click unfollow due to American politics or sports bleeding into my time line.</p><p>In many ways Google Plus got it right all those years ago, by sharing to specific circles the reach of posts were reduced, but in return you only showed people what you wanted to show them. Could a more modern approach be found to separate identities and build a place to express yourself in different ways without putting others off?</p><p>Twitter and Facebook still feels too much like shouting into the void and waiting for the replies. Many of which never arrive because we all have hundreds of people to follow and simply can’t keep up with it all. Clicking follow on more and more people to give ourselves more and more to look at, for no other reason than ‘that’s just how it’s done’.</p><p>Social Media isn’t going anywhere, but some are feeling the same pinch points that I feel and are starting to wonder where to go from here. The answer may be to spread yourself over many things, at least until Social Media becomes more social again.</p>

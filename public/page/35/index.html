  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Hello all. You may not have even noticed, but I’ve <a href="/2023/01/12/im-going-off.html">taken a short break</a> way from being online. Stresses and strains on my life have meant that I haven’t had much time to be my usual self on the internet, both in time and temperament.</p>
<p>I first noticed this towards the start of the week that I wasn’t in the best frame of mind and didn’t want my negative attitude to affect my posts or replies. I’ve let this happen before when Twitter poked and prodded at me to cause an emotional reaction, but learnt to deal with it is much better now.</p>
<p>It’s remarkable the different the way you feel impacts the way you think and react to things. Being mindful of emotions is important, and often having to save all my mental energy for important decision or deep work in my day job means I am exhausted when it comes to posting and replying online. For better or worse I truly value what I do around the internet and as such a step back is what I (and possibly many people) need every now and again.</p>
<p>What I thought was solely down to manipulation of emotions and my attention by social media companies runs much deeper than I first realised. However, the fact remains that social media companies work hard to pull on these strings and keep users interacting with their service. Emotions breed interaction. Mastodon, and in my case specifically through micro.blog, is a much nicer place for me to hang out. That doesn&rsquo;t mean there are not issues caused by the <a href="/2022/12/01/snacking-on-the.html">constant stream of updates</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of the negativity. It’s only when I step back and don’t post do I realise how much I miss it. I get overly worried about being connected all the time, but it provides a considerable benefit to me. Not only that, but I’m lucky to have found numerous great people that interact with me. Thanks for being wonderful.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Matthias Ott predicting 2023 is <a href="https://matthiasott.com/notes/the-year-of-the-personal-website">The Year of the Personal Website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your personal website is a place that provides immense creative freedom and control. It’s a place to write, create, and share whatever you like, without the need to ask for anyone’s permission.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of the main reasons I started my blog. I had been writing for other peoples for a long while, providing tech news sites with 4–5 posts a day for free, but wasn’t allowed to write about what I want to. My writing wasn’t an expression of me, it felt like being exploited.</p>
<p>So, a created a personal website. Something that could reflect me. It linked out to the posts I was still writing for other sites, but also mixed in photos, personal thoughts and everything else I wanted to post. It was my place on the internet, and in many ways it was <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>Since 2012 I’ve never stopped blogging. Unfortunately, back then I wasn&rsquo;t really concerned about my posts, so when I moved or decided to change things I pruned older things and ones I didn’t like. So many of my words are lost, <a href="/2018/04/04/wheres-my-name.html">many don’t have my name on any more</a>, but lots and lots are still here.</p>
<p>I won’t lose any of them again. Nor will I give them to other websites to monetise for their gain, or get drawn into the worst if of the worst on display. There have been many years that blogging is “coming back” but it <a href="https://cdevroe.com/2023/01/11/blogging-is-alive">never left</a>. This year more than any other, it might be true though. We’re dusting off our personal websites and making the internet ours again. My origin story will be different to all others, and some people will be starting right now. I can’t wait to see what we build together, with our blogs.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’ve never been a fan of black and white photos. Not in the sense that I don’t like them, I’m just not drawn to them, and they don’t speak to me as much as some people. My wife, on the other hand, is obsessed with black and white. Shooting in it constantly, or editing all of our photos into monochrome afterwards. Every single photo print that is up in our house I’ve had to edit into monochrome to her tastes, and until now, it’s been frustrating.</p>
<p>I have no idea what flipped in my head at the weekend, but I just decided to go out and shoot in black and white. I found a really <a href="https://fujixweekly.com/2022/12/28/ilford-fp4-plus-125-fujifilm-x-t5-x-trans-v-x-trans-iv-film-simulation-recipe/">nice film recipe that emulated old Illford film</a> and <a href="/2023/01/08/no-idea-why.html">off I went</a>.</p>
<p>Since doing so, I’ve shot so many basic things that have been transformed to show much more in the photo. By switching to black and white, the images show so much more drama. Not to mention, I feel like I’m stepping back in time to one much simpler than now. The below shot is straight from camera jpegs whilst walking the dog to try to show what I mean. It’s boring, but appealing.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/96bfbdea86.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I love the noise, the creamy colours and the texture of the leaf. There’s just something about black and white that I’ve failed to notice so far. Perhaps it’s because I’m shooting <em>in</em> black and white, so I’ve only ever seen the shot that way. Instead of shooting in colour and effectively removing it all? I’m not certain.</p>
<p>This isn’t so to say I’m converted, but a simple change to my camera has enabled me to see things differently. There aren’t many things that are like this any more, so it’s a strange feeling. Plus, I also have my wife’s “I told you so” in my ear!</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It appears that this <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html">journaling thing</a> is sticking. At least for now. I am 8 days into it (I started a bit before deciding to purchase pro) with a streak going and everything. Out of those first few days I almost forgot once and didn’t complete my morning pages until 2pm. Which I don’t think is bad going for something I am still unsure what to do with.</p>
<p>Whenever I write about this people come back with all sorts of suggestions, that I have tried numerous time. I could be really stupid but I still don’t know what to write half the time. I am just getting into the habit of opening the app to my morning pages journal and typing something out. It usually starts with some navel-gazing, but some thoughts and feeling usually come to the surface fairly quickly.</p>
<p>There is no way to know if this helps at all, but as an overall indicator of the new year, I do feel better in myself and have more motivation to do things. However, that could be that I actually managed to sleep over the holidays and my body is at a baseline of tiredness instead of <a href="/2021/12/01/team-no-sleep.html">in desperation mode</a> (it was 2:20am this morning).</p>
<p>Weirdly, I actually enjoy the process of spending a few minutes to typing things out in my own bubble. I try to do 5 minutes, and it sometimes goes a little over. I can get quite a bit off my chest in that time. I am going to start saving more things to Day One when we spend time as a family and keep some pictures in there, but as for journaling, I am still unsure. As a first test I <em>will</em> do 30 days and see what I end up feeling like.</p>

      <p>I often forget to put these two tiny words into my sentences. When I make <a href="/categories/links/">link posts</a> or try to make a point, it’s easy to get carried away and state your opinion as fact. When all we are really doing it publishing what we think.</p>
<p>There’s typically not many definitive answers to the things I tend to write about. It’s all ephemeral thoughts, feelings, educated guesses. There might be some research conducted here and there about the topics, but frequently the conclusions to those have more questions than answers.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with giving our opinions on things, it’s the whole point, really. Blogging about topics and ideas that we have that might be right. Yet, I forget to put in those tiny words a lot of the time. I think a lot about the topics I write about, I just don’t write about thinking. I write about knowing.</p>

      <p>Matt Birchler <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://birchtree.me/blog/im-once-again-defneding-like-buttons/">defending the like button</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think of likes on social media kind of like non-verbal responses in the real world.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with the statements Matt makes (or made a while ago) because they are accurate to social media convention. Most people won’t reply, nor will the author get as much affirmation back to their post. But to that, I push back and say it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>We’ve convinced ourselves to do things for likes and clicks. Posting for the sweet dopamine that comes from peoples responses when we shouldn’t care. As if posting to the internet is some kind of performative act.</p>
<p>I say shouldn’t because I get it, <a href="/2021/11/12/do-i-like.html">we all like likes</a>, but we shouldn’t do. A like online is the social media version of “lol” to a text message. It means I’ve seen this, and I want to avoid appearing rude, so heres a button click.</p>
<p>In many ways, it’s worse. Even if, as Matt points out, the replies are mostly “cool” and other derivatives, at least the person took some time to do it. They didn’t fall down, responding with anything besides a button click. But pressing like makes you and the person on the other end feel good, so there&rsquo;s no immediate downside, really.</p>
<p>It’s the long-term effects that <a href="https://www.thinkuknow.co.uk/professionals/our-views/likes-loves-and-shares-how-we-can-reduce-their-impact-on-wellbeing/?fbclid=IwAR3xWZz_Dl25HzpHr3Cu2ONiv1pS0E7f_C3RqE9j0wGB0jjqOAlc51YHmgg">cause the issues</a>. Even though it may not apply to you, a huge proportion of people get self-worth from likes. They have become a yard stick that people measure themselves against, and have removed a lot of interaction. Not all interaction is verbal, I get it, but I also don’t have a counter next to the number of people that’s smiled at me today.</p>

      <p>Mike Chudley in his video on <a href="https://youtu.be/8jAev1AecMk">Why 85mm is RUINING your Street Photography</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that 85 millimeter lens could be ruining your street photography and more precisely hindering your ability to improve as a street photographer</p></blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>someone walking down the street at f/1.4 isn&rsquo;t street photography it&rsquo;s lazy</p></blockquote>
<p>First things first, I really like Mike’s videos (usually) and have followed him on instagram for a long time. He is a great photographer and one of my inspirations. I’ve DM’d him a couple of times to say I love his photography, and he seems like a nice, genuine guy. I think this video is purposely explosive to get views and spark discussion. Which is a good thing, but I’d like to push back.</p>
<p>The way the video comes across, and some statements made infuriate me because it is needlessly preachy. Not because <a href="/2022/04/16/mm-for-street.html">I’m a fan of 85mm</a>, but because it’s dismissive. I simply can&rsquo;t get as close as 35 mm in the places I go, I can’t walk around London for hours on end, so I have to take what I can find. Smaller towns and villages are my stomping ground and I <em>have</em> to be a bit further away, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>I agree with what he is hinting at. Low aperture shots look nice, but often don’t show off the whole point of street photography. All the situational information and the environment is blurred out, removing the entire point. But smaller focal lengths just don’t suit my style, so to say I am lazy, and my photography isn’t good enough because I don’t like standing on top of people is just bizarre.</p>
<p>I switched off when he claimed that “walking down the street at F 1.4 isn&rsquo;t street photography, it&rsquo;s lazy”. There is some useful advice in there somewhere, but the hyperbole ruined it for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>fundamentally people are, when it comes to the internet, lazy. And gathering where everyone else is definitely seems easier. It&rsquo;s also easier to delegate the job of moderating and policing to someone else, and so as a result people will inevitably cluster around a few big websites, regardless of what infrastructure we build.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this post is spot on. These people hanging around on mastodon, and other ActivityPub supporting platforms, are a tiny minority. Most people don’t want to think about servers, moderation, or anything. They will just go where everyone else is.</p>
<p>Why do you think people hold on to horrible places like Instagram for far too long? They <em>are</em> lazy, unmotivated and insulated by a herd. It’s a nice idea, and a wonderful place to be, but it’s never going to be mainstream&hellip;..but that’s totally OK.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Another little app that I discovered to <a href="/2023/01/04/two-new-mac.html">aid my Mac life</a> recently is <em>another</em> free one. I discovered this one through a post by fellow micro.blogger <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://heydingus.net/blog/2022/12/folder-peek-app">Jarrod Blundy</a>, and it has become a staple of my Mac usage ever since.</p>
<p>Do you ever have to go digging around in finder to head to the same usual folders time after time? Me to. We have a Dropbox shared archive at work that drives me insane with the amount of level changes I need. Sure, I could set up a load of messy aliases or dock folders, but this apps solves all of that. Placing a nice and neat icon in my menu bar and storing all the folders I require.</p>
<img src="uploads/2024/531d519647.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
<p>I can also navigate around with ease to other destinations, see a preview of the file, or open the file I require without leaving my desktop. There are so many delightful little touches that it's hard to point out them all. My favourites are right-clicking on the icon opens the folder in finder, and that I can set a few different folders to all be accessible from one menu bar icon. Although it is starting to look a bit full now!</p>
<p>I am so impressed with this app I’m also testing a few other ones by the same developer <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/apps">Sindre Sorhus</a> as they all seem very high quality. I have already installed, <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/today">Today</a> to put my calendar in my menu bar (menu bar all the things) and also <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/actions">Actions</a> to extend Shortcuts abilities. I have a feeling that I might be going all out on customising my Mac currently so I hope you don’t mind me sharing what I find along the way.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>This afternoon, I randomly decided I was going to go into town and buy a bullet journal. No idea why, just seeing all the new year posts around and <a href="https://patrickrhone.micro.blog/2022/12/31/preparation.html">numerous people setting theirs up</a> made me want one. The only issue is that I already know this wouldn’t work for me, I’ve tried it, and only a few days ago writing <a href="/2022/12/31/i-really-want.html">two posts outlining why this wouldn’t work for me</a>. That wasn’t going to stop me though.</p>
<p>Watching YouTube and looking online for the journal I was going to buy, and it only took about an hour for me to realise the error in my thinking. I would happily pay £20-30 to get a book and some pens etc, but not £20 for a year if Day One (there’s a new years offer until today). I already know that digital tools are better for me to use. The only attractiveness of using something manual is that I will have even <a href="/2021/10/07/i-dont-use.html">less reason to use my phone</a>. Which is still quite attractive, I must admit.</p>
<p>What I did instead was stump up for a year of premium in Day One, so I can have a few different journals. One for morning pages. One for random thoughts and feelings whenever I feel like writing, and perhaps another for logging what we get up to as a family with photos. I really like the idea of getting one printed each year with our adventures in.</p>
<p>So, I went full circle in a matter of an hour or so, just like I always do, but I do feel like this will really help me, I feel positive about this decision.</p>

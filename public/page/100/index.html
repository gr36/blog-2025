  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When the rumours first started hinting at Apple working on a smartwatch, I was already sold. My wrist had already had an Android wear watch strapped to it, but since my switch to Apple products, my pebble watch although great wasn’t cutting it. Now four years later, it is the single bit of hardware that keeps me using an iPhone – but man is it ugly.</p>
<p>You see I have a bit of a thing for watches, in fact before smartwatches became a real option I had around 15 different ones in my possession, but the Apple Watch ruined all my style, due to its notification and health monitoring. It’s not ugly in terms of a smartwatch, although not <a href="https://www.mobvoi.com/uk">the most beautiful looking</a>, but its dam ugly when compared to most regular watches. Take the Apple Watch out of a fitness environment, and it sticks out like a sore thumb. Although the Apple Watch is becoming more acceptable in business meetings and formal situations, it just needs something more.</p>
<p>The ridiculous price tagged editions or making them out of expensive materials isn’t the answer, but the design is. Given Apple’s insistence on complicating product lineups in recent years, is it time for different shapes and an iPhone X type shift. A model that is higher priced, but a glimpse at improved design and specification. The time has come to move away from a squircle – it’s uncomfortable, ugly and looks out of place unless your colleague has a Samsung gear watch.</p>
<p>I have never seen a wrist that the watch fits comfortably on at all times, I don’t feel it often myself, but each time I see a picture of anyone wearing one it is ways poking away from their arm at a weird angle. As much as a round shape doesn’t fit as much information onto, at least it looks like it belongs on your wrist as long as you get the design right.</p>
<p>It is a good job the Apple Watch has become so ingrained in my life because I still loathe putting it on. The sad reality is I couldn’t live without it, my phone never makes a noise any longer, because only the essential things tap me on the wrist and let me see if I need to give my phone any attention. I’m still longing for a better watch to look at. The best looking and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17820290/apple-watch-sales-idc-report-best-selling-smartwatch-wearable-market">most popular smart watch</a> shouldn’t be the pinnacle, Apple needs to aim for the best-looking watch.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’m not sure if you’re aware of this, but I use a lot of Apple products. I understand this might come as a shock, but quite a few years ago I decided it was the best option for me to lean in and get the benefits of living solely in the Apple garden. I’ve dipped my toe in and used several other devices, but for the most part, it hasn’t been worthwhile. However, for the last few days, I have been considering vaulting those walls and running away because I have a real fear they are getting too high.</p>
<p>The recent Apple services event went down as perhaps the most boring of all time, and possibly one of the cheapest I’ve ever watched. None of the new products interest me, and even if they did, they won’t be launched outside the US any time soon. What they did do is spread an overwhelming fear through my soul, sole for the fact I am scared of becoming trapped.</p>
<p>Much like the ever-growing pay scale in a corporate job, Apple keeps ramping up the barriers to leaving and afraid one day I’m going to have a breakdown in my corner office. Sure I don’t HAVE to use Apple news, but when followers share links to things they have read I can’t read them without the Apple News app. I don’t have to read the magazines, or indeed watch the TV shows, but it’s pitched as though I’d be stupid not too. – and then the screws start to turn.</p>
<p>TV and reading the news turns into another Apple Music or Airpods. Sure there <em><em>are</em></em>competing platforms, but they can’t even stand up against the wall due to Apple kneecapping them with access to Siri, in-app payment taxes and in the case of headphones, <a href="/2018-03-24-the-w1-conundrum/">proprietary hardware</a>. Nothing changes in the immediate, but much like <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/apple-app-store-spotify">Spotify now feels</a>, the same will come of all other services available to your Apple hardware. Play the game the Apple way or lose, badly.</p>
<p>This feeling is without a doubt on its way toward the user base. Why would you want to pay anyone else for service whey Apple provide it all? ‘We wouldn’t go as far as to call you stupid, but people that buy our stuff are <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/07/09/researchers-claim-iphone-and-ipad-ownership-is-a-wealth-indicator">rich in case you don’t you know</a>.’</p>
<p>What’s worse is that you can’t even take these things with you, so indeed you can give up a handset or laptop that has its faults and get something arguably better. Yet none of the content is transferable; this lock-in feeling is growing to dread. Could there be a future where escape is impossible, finding the <a href="/2018/10/12/finding-apple-escape.html">right velocity</a> is still possible, but we are moving very fast towards a time that it isn’t – and that should scare you.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Not in that way! I’ve never been happy with the way my blog performs, or looks, and unfortunately I spend too much time tweaking things and even creating completely new ones! This is time I should be spending doing other things, or you know, actually writing things to publish on my blog.</p><p>So the time has come to make something and stick to it, I’m currently debating over a few different options – and I’ve managed to narrow it down to three options. I either move all of my content onto a hosted micro blog, publish everything on a redesigned Jekyll blog or use <a href="https://blot.im/">blot.im</a>.</p><p>Blot really appeals to me because I can just stick a markdown file in a Dropbox folder and let it work its magic. It’s quick and easy, minimal fee (£20 a year) and very minimal fuss. The downside of this is the themes are limited, and I’m struggling to get my head around editing it into something I’m happy with. My worry is that its a little slower than my Jekyll affair, and I think I will edit the design too much.</p><p>Jekyll is easy for me to work with, has zero cost (outside of a domain) and there are loads of themes and a wealth of knowledge out there on the internet. The downside is that it requires a bit more preparation to get a theme to where I want it to be, and a little more work in publishing (pushing to Github). This is pretty easy on iPad, but a little more annoying on Mac (but not impossible).</p><p>Micro.blog has appealed to me for a long time, and it has almost infinite support for custom Hugo themes. However I am still not sure if I want all my short and long posts appearing together? As I have spoken about before, I am still struggling to admit I’m never going to be a writer. I publish completely different things on my <a href="https://gr36.me/">micro.blog</a>, to on my <a href="https://gr36.com/">main blog</a> – but in all honesty there is no reason this needs to continue.</p><p>I’m also a little nostalgic over my creaky old Jekyll theme, it is the only one I’ve used and I’ve modified it so much I think I could rebuild it in my sleep!</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I often day dream about the perfect future of pretty basic products. This often leads to some strange outcomes and random doodles but lately I have been thinking through the future of targeted advertising and I’m a little worried.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong my ideal future for being tracked around the internet, and also real life, is for it to be killed off. However there is clearly a future for them, so what is the logical best product they could produce. Simply speaking, the idea of this technology is to get so good it predicts products and services you need <em><em>exactly</em></em> when you need them. So presumably the apex product is one that every advert shown results in a sale.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ten, fifteen years from now the world will be nothing like what we remember, nothing much like what we experience now, we will be swimming in impulses and data—the microchip will make us offers that will be very hard to refuse. – <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/02/08/reading-in-the-age-of-constant-distraction/">Sven Birkerts</a>, The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age</p></blockquote>
<p>The algorithm gets to a stage where it is so good, it can predict everything about you and the events of your life, that each advert pitched to you is perfect. This sounds both perfect and a nightmare, depending on your opinions on consumerism, but first consider that advertisers are recording your <a href="https://medium.com/@thomashillhouse/three-reasons-the-facebook-cambridge-analytica-data-breach-is-different-ef5c9ca5b99a">gullibility</a> and also how much influence you may have over others. So if life is indeed heading for one filled full of impulses and data driven experiences, the data collected and targeted suggests something very wrong indeed.</p>
<p>So don’t be confused in thinking this is a future a long time from now, movement into this reality is going at a staggering pace. What’s the worst that could happen from this? We buy a few products that don’t turn out to be all the great and move on. Indeed a few lost pounds, or a bit of annoyance returning a product is one thing, but consider if it’s not a product you are selling at all. It could be an idea, or a political opinion being pushed instead of a pair of jeans.</p>
<p>That Facebook friend you hardly know who shared that fake news story? It may not be an accident of your friend’s gullibility; that friend could have been specifically targeted with a fake news story using personality and network information like that found in the Facebook / Cambridge Analytica data breach. – <a href="https://medium.com/@thomashillhouse/three-reasons-the-facebook-cambridge-analytica-data-breach-is-different-ef5c9ca5b99a">Tom Hillhouse</a></p>
<p>This reality is happening right now, targeting adverts and also data brokers are allowing their systems to pitch ideas and beliefs to people, and you don’t have to delve too deep to realise how <a href="https://www.referendumanalysis.eu/eu-referendum-analysis-2016/section-7-social-media/impact-of-social-media-on-the-outcome-of-the-eu-referendum/">bad this could end</a>. If these same algorithms and systems get so good they can sell you anything, including swaying your votes we are in real trouble.</p>
<p>So when people are perfectly fine with <a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44686">Google</a> (and others) collecting all of their data because they don’t mind seeing better ads I shudder a little. This runs much deeper than buying more stuff, in the not too distant future it could be changing your beliefs.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>One of the most difficult urges I struggle to let go of is my desire for stuff. To buy things just because I can, and upgrade to the latest and greatest simply because it was released. Thankful this pang is getting less and less, but there is an over arching trend of commercialism to push the latest update onto people and cause many of them to over extended their budgets to make this purchase.</p>
<p>So when Apple semi-secretly updated their product ranges with new iPads, they gave a much better line up. Now you can get 75% of an iPad Pro experience for a fraction of the price. A base model iPad Air, with keyboard and pencil will now set you back £727 which is cheaper than just purchasing an iPad Pro on its own. If you wanted a compatible set up for an 11” iPad Pro it grows to a wallet busting £1067.</p>
<p>Does the iPad Pro provide a more than 30% better experience? Unfortunately there is no answer to this question, that would be unique to your use case, but its now worth thinking about. Sure there <em><em>are</em></em> differences, but how much of a difference to stop users from over paying to achieve a similar result? Apple will consider this in terms of limiting sales of the iPad Pro, but will users see this as a worthy purchase?</p>
<p>This question is more obvious when you consider the upgrade cycle of mobile phones. Information suggests that people are holding off <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/30/iphone-upgrades/">upgrading as often</a>, that is perhaps due to the increase in prices, and some argue it is lack of innovation. However there are still a huge amount of people overstretching to upgrade to the newest handset. Top tier handsets are now hovering around £1000, meaning that the norm in the UK has become 3 year payment plans to make upgrades more cost effective – yet still more than <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/766888/martin-lewis-money-show-mobile-phone-contract">double the average contract</a> cost from 2014.</p>
<p>As shown above when Apple launched the iPhone XS, the iPhone 7 is available for less than half the price. Many users would be hard pressed to find the iPhone XS to be 100% better than the iPhone 7, I say this is a person with an iPhone XS sat on my desk, from a place of privilege. I am also a person that now questions why I even bothered to upgrade. My, as well as many other peoples, urge to upgrade was one to keep up with the times. There are a few things I really desired (such as dual sim) but for the most part my desire to purchase came from my ego. I get very little extra benefit over the iPhone X that was sat here only a few months ago, and given the chance again I would not splash out.</p>

<p>When brands make a range of products available at every price point, it is considered a grab for money. A play to make sure everyone can afford to buy something new. This may be the case, but it also opens up a much better reason not to over extend the budget, providing they are marketed in the correct way. The iPad Air may not be 30% worse, but it saves people 30% of their money, there is <a href="https://gr36.com/2019-03-17-your-tech-investment/">less and less reason</a> to upgrade outside your budget now – and that’s a great thing.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>For many years there were apparent differences between the technology we bought. Clear divides between what companies were and were not able to produce, the laptop market was still as it is now, but in mobile some phones sucked, and other prevailed. A tech world was a sea of constant compromises as brands valued different things in their TVs, computers and even headphones.</p>
<p>Now, more than ever, everything is the same. Sure there are a few items which are considered ‘the best’, but in almost all price points and markets, most things are pretty much created equal. Gone are the days of being able to answer an enquiry of what laptop to buy with “just get a MacBook Air”.</p>
<p>So how exactly do people wade through a world this complicated? It’s a huge task, but it is now absolutely vital that users start to choose items based on the ethics and values that a company holds.</p>
<blockquote><p>Before you dive into any new doodah, consider a company’s ethics, morals, branding and messaging. If you aren’t comfortable, look to alternatives. – <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/technology/how-to-survive-the-next-era-of-tech-slow-down-and-be-mindful.html">Farhad Manjoo</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Sure you can pick up a de-humidifier or Bluetooth speaker for a fraction of the price from a small Chinese brand that may disappear tomorrow. We as users have no idea where they come from, how it is made or indeed who the profit is going to. Apple can and should be held up if the production lines don’t provide adequate conditions, but can all companies? Do you know what your investment is funding, where the item came from and what went into it? Are you comfortable to the investment the workers put into it in exchange for what you will get out of it?</p>
<p>All of these questions are almost impossible to answer completely, but the real issue is how many people out there don’t care. Consumers are told to focus on what the device can do, and how much better it is than the last one instead of what the real value of the device is. This device might be cost-effective to you, or it might just be the best thing on the market, but what went into making it? Are you paying for it in other ways, or are other people paying for it in the worst way possible?</p>
<p>This is without taking into account the amount of personal data we give up to brands we have never heard of. Millions attach cheap home automation gadgets to their home WiFi with no thought of what it may be doing with all the data flowing through it. When are even leading phone brands such as OnePlus <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/340174/its-time-to-stop-buying-phones-from-oneplus/">found to be doing things more than a little bit shady</a>, who do you complain to if the same is found in your smart lightbulbs?</p>
<p>Consider also the services you use. Google has long provided a suite of apps that are often free and extremely powerful. With the trade-off that your data is collected and used to show you adverts. If this trade-off doesn’t vibe with you, there are a wealth of others out there to choose from. This is a huge positive to the end-user because being able to pick and choose where you place your allegiance is import not just for you but for the future.</p>
<p>As Fahad digs into above, where you place your purchase affects others. End-users must start to make firm decisions if the companies values don’t align with their own. We are in a world where most things are pretty much equal but still dominated by 3 or 4 huge corporations. If you don’t think a company is doing an excellent job with your data, your TV experience or your selfies, by all means, vote with your wallet and switch! However, consider who you want to give your money to and what it is funding. Who is paying for this investment?</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>It has only been a few days since <a href="/2019-03-03-rodecaster-update/">Rode updated</a> its Rodecaster Pro to utilise Muti track but it has already proved to be a brilliant upgrade. The ability to output upto 14 tracks simultaneously for post editing is quite frankly a ridiculous feat, but may take a little time to get your head around.</p>
<p>Here’s how to take advantage of the update and record using Audio Hijack – which is my <a href="https://gr36.com/gear/">podcast recording software</a> of choice.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Understand The Update</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The 1.1.0 update is pretty easy <a href="/2019-03-03-rodecaster-update/">to install</a>, but might take a little while to understand what exactly has been changed. Once the update is completed, disconnect and reconnect the USB-C cable to allow your computer to recognise a new connected device. Your Mac will now register two devices instead of one. RodeCaster Pro Stereo and also RodeCaster Pro Multitrack.</p>
<p>The connected USB-C cable now outputs 14 separate audio tracks to your Mac which apps such as Audio Hijack can record individually or mix together. The below image shows you the channel numbers for each output.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Set Up Audio Hijack</strong></strong></h2>
<p>To get started and understand what is going on the best way may be to start with a blank session, just to make sure you don’t alter any bespoke sessions you already have set up. Drag in an input device block, double click on the block and you will notice the RodeCaster Pro Multitrack device in the menu. Once you select this, more options will appear when you uncover the advanced tab underneath.</p>
<p>These are numbered 1 to 14 according to the layout detailed above. You keep a stereo output of the ‘master track’ (1&amp;2) but also mono outputs for Mic 1 (3), 2 (4), 3 (5) and 4 (6), as well as stereo for the USB input (7&amp;8), TRRS phone connector (9&amp;10), Bluetooth input (11&amp;12), and also the sound pads (13&amp;14).</p>
<p>A drop down menu under the left and right channels will unveil all of the available tracks, which you can select to your desired outcome. In my set up underneath I record over Skype with just one other person, meaning my set up is pretty straight forward. However now that 14 tracks are available you can create something really unique to your podcast.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Create Your Set Up</strong></strong></h2>
<p>Your usecase will vary, but in my session for <a href="https://byodpodcast.com/">BYOD</a> shown below I have my microphone connected to input 1 (track 3) and also the Skype audio (track 7) going into one input block. This then splits into two duplicate blocks, so I can record two separate mp3 files of just my audio and just Nati separately.</p>
<p>In between the duplicate block and the recorder I also have a meter block, just so I can check audio is being recorded correctly, and then into my audio recorder I also have the sound board (track 13) recored to grab any sound I play into the episode.</p>
<p>I could of course make this much more complicated, and record each individual block, or turn things on and off as I wish, however I like a much more simple set up that can be added onto if desired. This software update has already made my editing much easier and allows me to spend much less time worrying about recording.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>For as long as I’ve been using <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-02-19-one-year-ipad-computer/">an iPad as my computer</a> I’ve used it because it was the most portable option I could find. I’ve hovered around the 10” mark since there were options in size <sup><a href="https://gr36.com/moving-to-the-bigger-ipad/1">1</a></sup> and been perfectly happy doing so. It gave me a screen big enough do what I needed on the go and could also be used to relax and read my Pocket feed. I partly blame it on <a href="https://darylbaxter.com/">Daryl Baxter</a>, but I’ve upgraded to the 12.9 – and in true clickbait style – here’s why.</p>
<p>I’ve used the 12.9” version before, in fact it was my first iPad Pro – but it only lasted a couple of days before being returned. It was simply too large to me to carry around, and didn’t offer me enough value to pot up with the extra bulk. It was brilliant to use on a desk, but <em><em>much</em></em> worse everywhere else, so it was quickly returned and I waited for the 9.7”.</p>
<p>The other ‘smaller’ models followed and I leaned into the iPad lifestyle more and more as things got easier and easier. A screen of around 10 inches is absolutely fine, but of course if you need to get things done a larger screen is nearly always better. However I was very much of the opinion that if I am travelling with the added weight and bulk of a 12.9 screen, I might as well take a MacBook.</p>
<p>Thats is of course until this new version. It’s old news now, but the new version is considerably smaller and lighter than the last one. It feels much the same when in use than my old 11”, and fits into most ‘tablet pockets’ in bags. That is not to say it isn’t heavier and larger than the smaller version I am used to. My technique of using the device seated and reading articles has changed, and as a strange by product of this I use my iPad much more like a laptop than ever. I have even caught myself several times typing out posts on the software keyboard – shock horror!</p>
<p>So there are definitely compromises to make and a smaller version is going to be the better option for most people, but this version is finally at a stage that these issues do not negate the improvement of having a larger screen. I am so happy I was talked into it, and you <em><em>might</em></em> be too.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">

<p>There is a tendency amongst the people I follow on Twitter, and converse with online to get defensive. If you buy a certain product, or talk about a particular thing you are then forever labeled. Expected to defend or comment on everything that happens in that space, and quite often passively mocked. I use Apple products, I more or less like what they produce – but I couldn’t care less what they do as a company.</p>
<p>I’ve said this a few times, most recently of which on <a href="https://www.byodpodcast.com/episodes/episode-81-unapologetically-meh/31/12/2018">last weeks BYOD podcast</a> – but I am unapologetically uninterested in half the ‘news’ surrounding the company. Just because I buy technology equipment from a certain company, purely because it fits my needs, does not mean I give a damn about anything else. If the company folds tomorrow, it might cause me a minor inconvenience, but I really wont care in the slightest.</p>
<p>Why should I care that Apple achieves a certain revenue, or equally that they are doomed because some person on Twitter says so. I am focused on what a difference the products make to my life, what they do for others, and what I can do to help people get the most from their device. I am not bothered how many iPhones sell in China (or anywhere) all I care about is if <em>I</em> buy one or not.</p>
<p>It’s exciting to talk about upcoming products, speculate on rumours about features, or even joke about software bugs – but when it comes to the rest of the noise all I can do is shrug.</p>
<p>Today, here and now, I am making a stand to avoid all talk about sales figures, share prices and all the other stuff that goes with it. I am focused on talking technology and what I does for me (and the world) and the positives surrounding various different products.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Whilst spending far too long redesigning this blog, I’ve come to the conclusion that it look fine the way it is and I couldn’t be bothered with a huge change. So instead I’ve been looking into changing some of the small things. Many of these were pretty easy, but my biggest one was the styling of footnotes.</p>
<p>Whilst trying to get to the bottom of exactly how I change the styling, there wasn’t a great deal of help out there to help. Information on the CSS related to Footnotes is quite confusing. Much of it was out dated and didn’t really apply when using a Jekyll blog. I managed to find a few bits of info and do a bit of testing and it turns out it’s pretty easy to do.</p>
<h2>Jekyll Stuff</h2>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to default to the markdown variation Kramdown. This already has footnotes built into it and displays them at the end of the article content. The vast majority of Jekyll blogs out there already use Kramdown, so you might not have to do anything, to check just have a look for <code>markdown: kramdown</code> in your <code>_config.ymal</code> file.</p>
<h2>The CSS Stuff</h2>
<p>This is where most of the information falls down, many resources will tell you to mess around and create a class for your footnotes so you can style this in CSS. That might be the case using WordPress or HTML but Kramdown presents it all neatly in HTML for you to style. There are two different parts you are able to change if desired.</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial footnote that appears in the article contents, in your sites CSS this is the <code>.footnote</code>.</li>
<li>The text showing information at the bottom is a serrate entity. This is what most people refer to as the citation, and this is styled using <code>.footnotes</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is pretty easy to get these confused but dead simple to style them both individually. All of the links and notes adopt the formatting of your regular content, but I wanted the footnotes to appear closer together and also in slightly smaller fonts as they do in academic papers. I also chose to add in some brackets around the footnote (a la Wikipedia) to highlight them a little more. My CSS snippet is as follows.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code>footnotes {
 font-size: 14px;
 margin: –10px 20px;
}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>.footnotes p {
 margin: 10px;
}</p>
<p>a.footnote:before {
 content: “[”;
}</p>
<p>a.footnote:after {
 content: “]”;
}</p>
<p>You can of course customise until your heart is content. This might seem pretty obvious to those in the the know, but I struggled to find any conclusive information easily. Hopefully this helps a little, I am still learning myself so wanted to put some information out there to try to help others.</p>

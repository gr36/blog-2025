<p>Using my iPhone to write blog posts feels more casual and personable. It’s like drafting a note to a friend or texting them about the latest happenings.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am often down on smartphones. If I had a <em>real</em> choice, I wouldn’t have one, yet it is by far the best computer I have. Like Cole above, I use mine for writing the majority of my blog posts, and catching up on my favourite things on the web. It is my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/04/01/creative-computer-in.html">creative computer</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on my iPhone doesn’t feel the same as sitting down and writing at my desk — that feels like I am working. Whereas typing out some thoughts in between life events feels like I am texting to a friend, which in many ways I am — all of you.</p>

     <p>Matt Birchler <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/is-this-the-slow-decline-of-the-apple-cult/">writing about his feeling from incident the Apple “cult”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do wonder if the Apple enthusiast crowd as we know is in permanent decline. You don’t need Daring Fireball, Panic, ATP, Birchtree, or anyone else like us to be massively financially successful (just look at Microsoft and Samsung), but I do find it a bit sad to see Apple stroll down the road to being a totally heartless mega corp like the rest</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m starting to feel this too. I’m uncomfortable how Apple is increasingly focusing on income, despite being one of the riches on the planet, instead of its users.</p>
<p>I am beginning to feel squeezed for every penny, increasing prices of phones, services, and everything they can. Limiting features to the US and generally <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/eu-competition-commissioner-says-apples-decision-to-pull-ai-from-eu-shows-anticompetitive-behavior/">behaving like a petulant child</a> when they have to comply with laws that protect users.</p>
<p>I have long grown tired of the Apple apologists that try and to explain away every decision apple makes, yet many of them are even quiet at the company Apple has become. Every time new Pixel phones come around I toy with the idea of using something different, I ultimately won’t due to my love of the Mac and Apple Watch, but mainly because I don’t trust Google either!</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Of all the questions I have around the new AI on the block, <a href="https://www.friend.com">Friend</a>, I must admit that this one is the least of my worries. Like the rabbit that went before it, this gadget promises to address problems that are of a questionable existence. I understand that’s marketing 101 — overstate a concern and sell people a fix. However, they intend to do this by faking a conversation with a ‘friend’ and with it burn through resources that don’t fit their income stream.</p>
<p>There’s no question that these types of devices are going to start popping up all over the place. AI is the new buzzword to cram into every single service you have, and lately the new trend is making physical things. Despite many companies not really knowing what to do with it and still cramming it in. Whilst never making any money anyway.</p>
<p>We’ve long known that the balance sheets of darling valley companies like Open AI are <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-openai-could-lose-5-billion-this-year">massively in the red</a>. Meta, Google, and Apple are also spending Billions trying to catch the craze and still can’t make a useful enough product to turn a profit, so why exactly are all these start-ups joining in, you might wonder? I suspect for nothing more than cashing in on the latest investment craze into AI businesses.</p>
<p>Rabbit was the first company to offer what on the surface appears a great deal for customers, but underneath promises to be an untenable business position. Their Rabbit R1 is available for a one-off fee of £199, with no monthly subscription. Which gives the company zero income to pay for continued usage of their cloud AI infrastructure ‘Rabbit OS’. A weird decision given that almost every instruction needs off device processing — with <a href="https://youtu.be/ddTV12hErTc?si=pCrLJkgNk0VKT0yl">mixed results</a>.</p>
<p>Friend clearly feel flush with cash, given they paid $1.8million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/10/maybe-friend-wasnt-crazy-for-spending-1-8m-on-a-domain-after-all/">just for their domain name</a>, however their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/30/friend-is-an-ai-companion-backed-by-founders-of-solana-perplexity-and-zfellows/">reported $2.5million</a> (at a valuation of $50million) investment from some Silicon Valley heavyweights won&rsquo;t last long. Their basic white version of their pendant retails at just $99. A price that will barely pay for a few months of server time for the recordings taken on the constantly listening device. Listen, I get that people are lonely, but let’s be clear on this part, this device is constantly listening and sending your data to their servers. This isn’t a Siri or Alexa dormant way, in a proactive Black Mirror inducing nightmare way—even if the company claims not to be storing any of the recordings.</p>
<p>Unless there is a drastic change to Ai processing needs, companies selling these devices are only going one way. To burn through investment cash and then ask their users for money. There simply isn’t another way to fund this. AI companies are loosing a tone of money and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/07/ai-companies-unprofitable/679278/">many people are starting to think</a> that they are fighting a loosing battle. My worry is that users who buy these devices in good faith will be left holding the baby, or a device that no longer works.</p>

     <p>MGX <a href="https://mgx.me/why-i-think-slow-and-embrace-asynchronous-work/">posting on their blog</a> about the benefits of work that fits into your time frame:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An asynchronous work model, for example, empowers individuals to tackle complex problems on their own schedules based on critical thinking rather than constantly reacting to requests in real time.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are a knowledge or creative worker, and perhaps if you’re not, you will know the struggle of fitting your work into deadlines based on a regular 9-5 job.</p>
<p>The culture in many places still expects you to be at work during this time, switched on and being a good company person. When many of the tasks asked of you simply don’t fit into this mindset. The reason working from home works so well is that it is at least half a step in the right direction of letting workers control their lives, but it’s time for companies to go further.</p>
<p>I am immensely great full that my company lets me work when suits, granted mostly in the day, but to a beat that suits the rhythm of my life — namely earlier in the morning and later at night. By removing the pressure to deliver too quickly means more creative room to deliver better work.</p>

     <p>Vidit Bhargave, developer of Look Up, <a href="https://blog.viditb.com/action-centered-design/">writing about what is expected of a modern app</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not only is the iPhone app not the center of a user’s interaction on the phone. It’s increasingly becoming one of the many parts of an ecosystem where apps are expected to scale both in terms of interface and functionality starting from something as small as an Apple Watch and going all the way up to an unbounded experience like Vision Pro.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a fascinating post about the ways in which a good developer must think nowadays, and this is just iOS focused! You can’t just produce an app, ship it for the iPhone and think you are done — users, and OS makers, demand more from the applications they download and expect more from their paid services.</p>
<p>If you think about all the paces you expect to be able to interact with this piece of software you downloaded, one that in many instances you didn’t pay any for, you begin to realise how hard making a success of things can be.</p>
<p>As a user, I now expect to be able to use the app on my phone and tablet as a bare minimum. When in reality this expectation also includes the Apple Watch, perhaps the mac and even a VR. If I am a power user, I might also demand Shortcuts support, Siri integration and even a fancy API if the app calls for it.</p>
<p>There are widgets to think about, live activities and in the near future, Apple Intelligence integration. Great apps don’t just exist as a square on your Home Screen, they extend into numerous areas and through different interaction methods. We expect them to be available everywhere we are, and still moan because the developer wants to make an income from their work. Worth bearing in mind next time an app you love asks you for a contribution.</p>

<p>I contend that pretty much the entire “I wish the iPad did more” narrative is built on a wide and undying desire for macOS to get touch input and more flexible and portable hardware. Think about it, if I could walk into an Apple Store today and get a MacBook Touch with a hyper-portable form factor, an M4 processor, and a beautiful OLED screen, would I then also complain about the limitations of iPadOS? No, of course not!</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that the Mac line up is crying out for some more flexible hardware to make it more interesting to more people. I wrote <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/08/01/the-ipad-life.html">a few days ago</a> that I wish there was more experimentation done with sliming down the hardware and pushing the limits of the form factor into more areas — notably an ultraportable version.</p>
<p>To bring some subjective experience in here, our sales team used to all use iPads and the entire reason I was ‘that iPad guy’ for a while was because of this. However, we as a company have outgrown iPadOS and hit the limitation of Shortcuts reliability. As such, they’ve all switched to Lenovo Laptops to be able to mark up documents still, but also get more desktop like features. Had there been touch Macs available, these would have been number one on the purchase list.</p>
<p>Read into that what you will, but I am sure more users than you think want a richer computer market with macOS. Would users regather buy a macOS device with, as Matt highlights, a “hyper-portable form factor, an M4 processor, and a beautiful OLED screen” than an iPad? I am not sure all would, but whilst Apple has been willing in the past to cannibalise their products, a la iPhone and iPod, modern Apple is a very different beast.</p>
<p>Apple knows that some users would, and that is precisely why Apple holds these two markets as far apart from each other as they can. For them, they rather you buy both devices, at the risk of loosing some sales to those that choose one over the other. I have never bought an iPad, be it a pro or otherwise, because it is powerful nor because of its screen. I buy one because it is portable, flexible and fits into how I want to use it.</p>
<p>There are some people who use an iPad because of its strengths, and even if a mythical macOS device existed, they would not stray away. However, there are far more people that expect more from their device than an iPad can provide.</p>

     <p>Matteo Wong writing <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/07/ai-companies-unprofitable/679278/">another great summary</a> of the data surrounding AI failure to return on investment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs’s head of global equity research, told me, “If we’re going to justify a trillion or more dollars of investment, AI needs to solve complex problems and enable us to do things we haven’t been able to do before.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I am starting to think that big tech companies are just a long line of bubbles. Create a buzz around something (blockchain, NFT, Ai, whatever )get loads of investment and wait for the pop.</p>
<p>Don’t worry though because they can just pivot and stuff the next big thing into their apps and raise another round of investment.</p>

     <p>Jarrod Blundy writing in <a href="https://heydingus.net/blog/2024/8/you-and-i-can-do-hard-things">You (And I) Can Do Hard Things</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doing the hard thing isn’t always fun. It’s often not the thing you want to do. There may be many reasons for you not to do the hard thing. But there’s almost always a good reason that you should do the hard thing. And I hope you remember that you can.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few months ago <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/05/06/finished-reading-the.html">I read</a> <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593138779">The Comfort Crisis</a> by Michael Easter, and it introduced the concept of misogi. An ancient Japanese practice of doing really, really hard things. There perhaps should be another really in there because this hard thing should push you to your limits and have at most a 50/50 chance of being achievable.</p>
<p>In doing so you are said to reach a state of sumikiri — complete clarity of body and mind. This all seems a bit out there, I admit, but by doing really hard things you achieve the mythical ‘flow state’. One that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/flow-theory#:~:text=Flow%20theory%20proposed%20by%20Csikszentmihalyi,and%20feelings%20are%20pushed%20aside.">Csikszentmihalyi</a> describes as “making life more rich, intense and meaningful”. Indeed, as covered in the book, people are physically harder, mentally tougher and on sounder footing spiritually when they experience discomfort.</p>
<p>So yes, you <em>can</em> do hard things, and you <em>should</em> do hard things — and you will be better off for it.</p>

     <p>Jared Henderson in a recent ParkNotes video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fITgm5V-m%5C_Y">Commonplace Books</a> (cleaned up by me):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that people found it refreshing to just be like oh I could just do this in a notebook and there&rsquo;s not like a system .. basically just a repository where I just write things down and I think there&rsquo;s something about the Simplicity of the idea and then the fact that it&rsquo;s not digital not on your computer it&rsquo;s not on a screen .. I think that people just got sick of doing stuff on screens all the time</p></blockquote>
<p>I know in my head that taking note digitally makes the most sense if you want to maximise the return on investment. If you would like to put everything into a hyper — organised, detail — orientated database, that&rsquo;s cool and everything, but the appeal of having a notebook is the opposite.</p>
<p>The messiness and disorganisation is the point for me. The simplicity of scribbling (seriously, my handwriting is terrible) into a book every so often is the best feature. It is the key to enjoying the things I do and removing as much of the extraneous things as possible.</p>

     <p>My superpower is thinking too much about the things I do and the choices I make. I used to think this was a hindrance because it sometimes stoped me acting quickly and getting things done faster than should. Or spending too much time worrying about things that didn’t need so much dwelling on. However, I do believe that you should be questioning yourself more than any other person could because it will give you strength in your convictions.</p>
<p>During my working life, I have come across many individuals that constantly question others. Both from a position of authority, and not. They require no other reason to question things and rubbish the ideas than the simple fact it did not come from themselves. You can segregate those people from those that have legitimate concerns by simply testing them on their decisions. Those that have logically made their decisions can back up their worries with sound judgement, and not simply “I think”.</p>
<p>This kind of mental questioning should happen in yourself when decisions arise. You should examine every angle, come up with ways it could fall down, and alternative solutions. Ensuring the motivation and the execution are sound, and at this point you will be able to defeated your position, if only to yourself. Giving you the confidence to continue on the path you have chosen, until you come across new information or evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>There is a limit, of course. By constantly testing everything around you, it sometimes feels as if you are building the anxiety in your brain for no good reason. There are life choices and decisions that don’t need to be tested to extremes, merely weighed up with the information you have instantly available. Done so in a time frame that gives the required space it needs and no more.</p>
<p>Questioning yourself isn’t a sign of weakness, it builds resilience. When you evaluate your choices and motivations critically, you become more adaptable to change and better prepared for challenges. By regularly questioning your actions and beliefs, you can find areas to improve and understand yourself better. Embrace this superpower, balance it with practicality, and you’ll make better decisions and navigate life’s complexities more confidently.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When I think about all of the hardware I have owned over the last few years there are far too many in that list that I care to admit. I do switch around phones every so often for reviews, but my personal computer life takes on huge dramatic swifts every now and again. Since <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/today-is-the/">prosumously ditching</a> the iPad after more than 5 years as my computer I have gone <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/using-an-ipad/">backwards</a> and forwards switching out laptops, for iPads, and back again. I think it’s time to stop.</p><p>In fact I think it was time to stop a while ago. I am really starting to struggle with work and life separation due to only having one Mac now. So much so I don’t want to open my laptop at home. I know that I will dive in to things that I, granted need to do, but don’t need to do when I wanted to write a journal log.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/f74adb8b16.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>I have some inspiration to thank for my meandering thoughts. Jack Batty <a href="https://copingmechanism.com/2021/trying-to-live-on-the-ipad-for-a-while/">wrote about</a> wanting to try and make the iPad his everything, and this part particularly stuck out.</p><blockquote>But, iOS is calmer than macOS, and right now I need a little calm. – <a href="https://copingmechanism.com/2021/trying-to-live-on-the-ipad-for-a-while/">Jack Baty</a></blockquote><p>To use the word that tech commentators hate to hear — when I am ‘working’ on an iPad (e.g. writing a blog post or editing a photo), it <em>feels</em> different. As Jack puts it, using iPad OS is calmer, it never feels like work. Granted sometimes it’s a full time job trying to work out how you do somethings that are simple on a Mac but <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-simplicity-of/">the simplicity</a> is so refreshing. The iPad feels <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/this-feels-more/">computer<em>ish</em></a> without feeling like the rest of my waking life.</p><p>So, here’s the ‘forcing’ part. I am going all in again. Apart from my work day, which I can do nothing about, I am using an iPad for everything else. I haven’t spent anything, it’s a 2018 12.9″ iPad Pro with a Magic Keyboard I have had for a long time so I have nothing much to lose. I am actually quite excited.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>At Apples WWDC 2021, Apple focused very tightly on <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/">improving the security</a> of their products. Many people dismiss this as a “marketing line” and although there are some worrying trends in the way they are going about things, this is the Apple way I approve of. One of the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/09/newsletter-publishers-concerned-apples-mail-privacy-protection-will-crater-industry">biggest push backs</a> has been against their improvements to Apple Mail that removes tracking and spying tactics used by marketers.</p>
<p>Dubbed Mail Privacy Protection, it nullifies the tiny little trackers in emails you receive, ones that relay loads of your private information to servers without your knowledge.</p>
<p>Presumably Apple will route emails through a proxy and load tracking pixels on their servers before serving the email to you and I am really struggling to find a downside to this. There will be loads of people waiting to tell me how wrong I am, just as they did <a href="/2021/03/10/stop-tracking-random.html">last time I pointed at them</a>. I am happy to be proven otherwise, but most of they people that speak up are ingrained in a business that needs this data, but my conclusion is drawn from three areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your newsletter is free, you don’t (or you shouldn’t) care if people read it or not, because the work involved in producing it is exactly the same. </li>
<li>If your newsletter is paid, you are paid by the people that sign up to receive it. Thus it makes no difference if people actually read it or not. The cost of production is the same, and you get paid the same regardless. </li>
<li>If you send marking emails, you will need to see if your emails are successful or not. This is the only area where tracking would matter to you, and to this is say tough. Full disclosure I am involved in this area of business and I am <em>still</em> happy Apple are turning off the tap to those more predatory than myself.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/774f0c2865.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" /></p>
<p>You see, there is nothing inherently wrong with tracking if an email is opened or not, it can be useful to know. We have it in message services such as iMessage, and you have been able to do this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-and-request-read-receipts-and-delivery-notifications-a34bf70a-4c2c-4461-b2a1-12e4a7a92141">optionally in Exchange</a> email for years. However these are transparent and something the end user has to agree to. Presumably using the method detailed above, all tracking pixels would be marked as opened anyway, and then it is up to the user to read it or not. However most tracking doesn’t stop at this.</p>
<p>Take a look at most marketers email dashboard and you will be able to see not just when it was opened and what links are clicked on but also how many times and where the person is! Data that should be protected unless a user opts in to share this with you. <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/use-track-mailchimp/">Pixel tracking</a> is one of the many scourges of the internet and I trust Apple to lead the fight against it.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.litmus.com/blog/apple-mail-privacy-protection-for-marketers/">cant say for sure</a> if the open rate metric will no longer be valid, but with certainty everything else will be killed off and I for one am overjoyed!</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Seth Godin on <a href="https://seths.blog/2021/06/a-new-decision-based-on-new-information/">making a new decision</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If we’re going to go forward, it’s because something has changed. It might be that our situation is different, that the story we tell ourselves is different, that the times have changed or that your offering has. It might be that we trust you more.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a lot of differing opinions when people change their decisions. The weirdest for me is when some think that changing your position makes you weak, or that you can’t be trusted. When in fact it shows a much larger ability to be balanced in your thoughts.</p>
<p>The common derogative term is “flip-flopping” and while never being set on your position is a bad thing, or as my Granddad would say “always being on whatever boat is floating” — when the situation changes there is absolutely nothing wrong with changing the way you approach it.</p>
<p>In fact it is the correct thing to do.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>We’ve has a huge shift at work, returning to more of an office based environment for at least a little while. I am really excited to be building up a larger team around me to push the company forward, but my trusty iMac Pro has been donated to a returning member of staff more in need.</p>
<p>Due to <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1405492177254371329?s=20">my indecision</a> in knowing what to do I am not left with only one computer. I know ultimate first world problem right! My working machine is my personal laptop, one that is with me almost always. I do love my 13″ MacBook Pro though, I purchased it a few months before they switched to M1 and it looks awesome working on a <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1403245747684921346?s=20">nice big display</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway I digress slightly. The point I am trying to make is that due to this shift, my computer is now everything. Personal things and working things are all done on the same laptop. So where I could separate my life slightly from my laptop to my iMac, that’s no longer possible. I never set up emails on my personal machines before and installed very few working apps. That is no longer possible, my home and office have merged, everywhere I turn working is always in my face.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/024bb57546.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" /></p>
<p>For most of the time this is fine. I love the work I do, and I often have ideas for design bits or some inspiration at the weekends. Being able to jump straight into Illustrator or Figma is a blessing for those sorts of situations. For every other time when I just want to open up my laptop and do some personal tasks, my emails and other work things are just right there staring at me!</p>
<p>If I thought I had lots of <a href="/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html">Twitter muscle memory</a>, I have even more for work tasks. I just find myself replying to emails on a Sunday afternoon, or managing tasks for the upcoming week without even realising it. Much like my working office being the same as where I do my personal things, it gets to the stage where there is no separation and I never feel like I am away. Some personal rules or spaces need setting up I think. Perhaps two users for my laptop. Or maybe I just need to <a href="/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html">get an iPad</a>!</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Upon reflection, it is entirely someone’s prerogative to block me for whatever reason they may have. That’s not something I’ll lose any sleep over. But, you know what would have been a little more rational? Taking the time to email me and explain their issue. Open an asynchronous dialogue like a decent human being where you can give your words and actions a little more consideration
</p></blockquote>
<p>I might start a movement about slowing down and thinking instead of reacting to the barrage of stimulus we get on a daily basis. I’ve done it, as will have most of you, when I should have opened I dialogue and tried to talk.</p>
<p>I’ve also been blocked by people that I follow very closely and took it amazingly personal, when they could have had a number of reasons to ban me from their timeline!</p>
<p>I am a huge proponent of talking to people that think different to you, and in in many ways don’t like you. If nothing else it gets you used to living with people that oppose you so you don’t live in a bubble.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I seem to be writing about the <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/06/12/will-the-ipad.html">iPad a bit more</a>, simply because people are thinking and talking about it more following WWDC2021. You can guarantee this always happens at two points, following release of new hardware, and after software updates. Amplify this double of Apple have released a new iPad and then talked about a software update that hasn’t met imaginary predictions. So, currently we are in the middle of a perfect storm, or I guess an imperfect one.</p>
<p>The common consensus seems to be that the iPad needs to move forward and be more like the Mac. There is some long held belief that the iPad Pro must start to deliver everything to everyone, becoming more like a traditional commuter — when in fact the opposite is true.</p>
<p>I love having a iPad because it can do everything I need. If I want to chill out on the sofa and read a bit, or I want to scribble some notes in a meeting it is perfect. I also know that of I need to draw out some design concepts, illustrate a document or connect a keyboard to write out a blog post it can do all that and more — with ease, and most of all simplicity.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/67fb302c3b.jpg" width="600" height="337" alt="" /></p>
<p>I can get in depth and have side by side windows, Slideover ones and picture in picture stuff going on, but I can also open an app in full screen by default and everything else gets out my way. No docks to hide, no menu bars or anything else to worry about — a procrastinators dream.</p>
<p>Some of these feelings come from working on a Mac all day. The iPad feels different and more relaxed, but even when I used an iPad as my main computer I just loved the way it was simple to understand and got where I needed it to go. I wasn’t trying to force a square peg in a round hole, I wasn’t expecting it to do anything more that I needed it to, because when push comes to shove, better tools are available.</p>
<p>I must applaud Apple for achieving this mix of power and simplicity for iPad OS. Every time “someone familiar with the matter” starts to talk about making the iPad like a desktop computer I feel a little bit of dread that the iPad will loose its charm. Push too far towards the work, and loose its way with everything else it is great at. I wish Apple would bring the iPad out into the sun with feature parody, but it doesn’t need anything else to be a great iPad. For everything else, there’s a Mac for that.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Before we get anywhere into this post, I absolutely refuse to start this stupid debate again. I love the iPad, I <a href="/2017/02/19/one-year-of.html">used it as my only device</a> for years, and <a href="/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html">now I use a Mac</a> because it fits my work life better. It is because I love it so much that I appreciate everything it can do for users.</p>
<p><a href="/2021/04/26/where-does-apple.html">As many others did</a>, I sat and watched WWDC2021 and expected the iPad to go up a gear. It did in many ways, but the updates still left many wanting more. I don’t believe users should be up in arms at the exclusion of “pro apps” and screaming for the myriad of features that were never promised by Apple — but with that said the iPad still feels a little stagnant.</p>
<p>Apple can’t or won’t make the iPad too powerful because they want you to buy a Mac too. For proof of this look no further than the upcoming <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/11/how-universal-control-on-ipados-15-and-macos-12-works">Universal control</a>. A feature which feels like an extension of Sidecar, allowing you to move your mouse across the many screens you have at your disposal. Be those Macs or iPads. Yet even <em>this</em> feature isn’t universal at all.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/0c3e382683.jpg" alt="e9e34e7ce2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>You can only use this control <em>from</em> a Mac. So if you were thinking you could use your iPad and move your mouse across to grab a file from a Mac, you have another think coming. Unfortunately Apple still view your iPad as Mac adjacent. A supplementary device that is amazingly powerful but just not <em>quite</em> there.</p>
<p>I worked from an iPad for around 7 years, since before the iPad Pro was even a thing. So I know what an iPad is capable of and I know where it’s limits are. You will get no wild claims from me about where you can and can’t work. Yet the iPad still seems to exist in the shade of the Mac. Not quite achieving its potential.</p>
<p>Seemingly for the fear of cannibalising Apples computer market. The taste left in many users mouths is one that all the moves Apple make are to entice customers to purchase more devices. Hey, they’re a company, that’s the way companies grow. But after years of users waiting and wishing for things I am starting to get the feeling that the prayers will always go unanswered.</p>
<p>Undeniably the iPad makes strives forward each year – some small, some large. Yet the potential is never met, and perhaps never will be. I dream of a world where the iPad steps into the sun and becomes its own thing, because it’s only Apple holding it back now.</p>

      <p>One of the best things about blogging and sharing things on social media is the constant changing environment and shifting your perspective. Yesterday I shared a few thoughts on <a href="/2021/06/11/but-what-about.html">what I am going</a> to try and stop on Twitter. The level of what about this can get annoying, so stopping it myself is a worthwhile endeavour.</p><p>Most people seemed to share a similar outlook, and the tweet below from Andy made me think a little more or letting people enjoy the things they enjoy – but also hate whatever they want to hate.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Everyone is quick to say that you should let people enjoy things. Should you not then, in turn, also let people complain / disagree / dislike things, as long as it’s done in a constructive / kind way?</p>— Andy (@AndyNicolaides) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyNicolaides/status/1403418821134794753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2021</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>This wasn’t directed at me, but seeing as I had not long shared my post, I took it as a sub tweet or at least something to pay attention to. Well, he’s dead right.</p><p>It’s important that everyone has a way to vent when they want to. If the prevailing opinion is that you should let people enjoy whatever they want, then we should be letting people hate whatever it is they want to hate.</p><p>Hate what a political party is up to at the moment? Let it out. Want to tell others have stupid Apple is? Go for it. Enjoy the release without 17 replies telling you how wrong you are.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>There are so many things I love about <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36">Twitter</a>. It was the first social network that clicked for me, despite having a Facebook account for a while before hand. The fast moving pace of updates and the activity levels of people that I enjoyed following just made it a place I wanted to be.</p>
<p>When I first started using Twitter I was hacking the iPhone and had a pretty successful side hustle unlocking them and helping others develop Cydia hacks. I was also really deep into Android Twitter building loads of friends that I still speak to all over the globe. I had a place, a constantly changing environment surrounded by people I wanted to deal with. I got hate from Apple fanboys but I didn’t care. This was me and I loved it.</p>
<p>The user base then felt like it was tiny. People that I spoke to in real life didn’t really use Twitter that much, but fast forward to now and it feels like everyone is here. It’s still fast moving, but it’s huge and often times exhausting. So <a href="https://gr36.com/2018/01/20/using-microblog-aka/">I’ve tried to quit</a>, more than <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/01/11/social-media-in/">once</a>. Yet I keep coming back once I feel better, and then it got too much again, and the world goes around because I never learn.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/538e51a027.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Trying to work out what is so exhausting is the puzzling part. Partly it is the speed of information flowing past, <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/04/11/time-to-slow/">slowing down</a> always proves effective. However I have never really ever managed to put my finger on why, until today.</p>
<p>Listening to an episode of ‘You’re wrong about’ <a href="https://gabz.me/2021/06/08/youre-wrong-about.html">recommended by Gabz</a> the concept of “What about…” was given as becoming exhausting and it instantly clicked of me. I love hearing other peoples opinions on things, expressing myself and giving far too many of my own outlooks in replies to tweets — and this is part of the issue. Opinions are something everyone has, and should be happy to share them with others, but when there is <em>so much</em> noise it gets frustrating.</p>
<p>As the host points out, When you tweet your three favorite bagels, someone will come back “but what about Poppy seed..”. The solution is not to <a href="https://guce.techcrunch.com/copyConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_110e3c71-85c4-4d53-9464-8afa519254d0&amp;lang=en-US">stop people from replying to tweets</a>, or limiting them in anyway, because that’s just not Twitter. To be honest I don’t think there is a solution, apart from not using Twitter so much.</p>
<p>I am certainly going to be more aware of the replies I make to others, and simply enjoy the sharing of opinions.Maybe write a blog post or two instead. Replying only when I have something to add, or a question is asked. This isn’t going to stop me going down rabbit holes and wasting time, but it should help my mental health a bit.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s amazing how easy I am to sway into using something else. I’m perfectly happy using obsidian, bar a few tiny things, yet here I am setting up Craft because it got daily notes.</p>
<p>It’s not that I have anything to gain, and it’s not marketing hype, I think I just like playing with new things and trying out other ways.</p>
<p>I guess it’s a bit of a waste of time but it give me quite a bit of enjoyment so what’s it matter. I enjoy the journey of transferring my information, setting things up to work for me. Those little “a ha” moments when you find a little feature that works are as enjoyable as finding a robust system and sticking with it.</p>

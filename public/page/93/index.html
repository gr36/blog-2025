  <section class="e-content post-body">

<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="zero-fasting-review.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a6ba75fa04.jpg" alt="Zero fasting review" width="600" height="300" border="0" /><br />A few days ago, I shared <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2020/02/13/intermittent-fasting-and.html">what intermittent fasting had done for me</a> and the health benefits I have felt. This app has helped me get going on my journey and is now an essential tool for tracking my body – it’s time to look at <a href="https://www.zerofasting.com/">Zero fasting tracker</a>. Available <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1168348542">on iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zerofasting.zero">Android</a>, I am using the iOS version installed on my iPhone 11 Pro and Series 5 Apple Watch.</p>
<p>This app will only appeal to you if you are intermittently fasting, and even if you are, most people still won’t rely on one. I only started looking for something when I needed a kick to keep me going and also to keep track of my habits better. With that, the Zero app is full of fasting information on why to do it, how to do it and the answers to loads of questions you might have.</p>
<p>I found when first starting out it was both a hindrance and help to have something counting down the hours until I could eat again. So you might look at other options first – but what the app does well is make everything easy to find and straight forward to understand. Splitting areas into four tabs across the bottom to see your timer, check out the fasting options,  delve into your fasting history or learn more about fasting in general.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Zero-fasting-screenshots-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c9c410001e.jpg" alt="Zero fasting screenshots 1" width="1000" height="478" border="0" />Zero enables you to start and stop your fasting quickly and gives you default options for regular ratios and also custom options. You can also get handy notifications (if you choose to switch them on) when you are in the final hour of fasting and indeed when you can start eating again. All customisable using the fasts tab at the bottom.If you’re feeling hardcore, you can track a full fast for up to 168 hours!</p>
<p>Users will spend the majority of the time starting and stopping the timer from the timer tab. Featuring a beautiful big clock, counting down the hours until your feeding window, or counting up the hours you have been feeding for. The big green (or red) button starts and stops your fast dependant what state you are in. If you forget you can edit start and stop times, and leave feedback on your fast at the end of each cycle.</p>
<h2>Apple Watch App</h2>
<p>You can also start and stop fasting with the companion Apple Watch App. There isn’t much more you can do on the watch, but it does come with complications in a range of sizes to slot into your choice of Watch face. I found this too overbearing and reminded me too often, which proved annoying after a while, but having a tap on your wrist when there is only an hour more to go can be helpful.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Zero-fasting-Applewatch-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9a1d948cdd.jpg" alt="Zero fasting Applewatch 1" width="1000" height="399" border="0" />It would be great to be able to edit fast start points and change the ratios on the Apple Watch in future updates. If I make a mistake or want to check my history, I have to pull my phone out, whereas a swipe across to different areas would be useful. You are able to change the number of hours you want to fast for before starting and this updates the iOS app information.</p>
<p>As well as a glorified alarm system, the app will track every fast you do and display it in one of the easiest to understand designs I have used. All the information is straight forward and easy to navigate. You will find information on your fasts, comparisons in time, and if you hit your intended target. Along with this, the app pulls heart rate data from an Apple Watch, allowing you to see trends easily. Since starting, I can see a pronounced decrease in resting heart rate, and this provides more positive feedback that everything is going well.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Zero-fasting-history-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/23374de776.jpg" alt="Zero fasting history 1" width="1125" height="955" border="0" />Of course, there is a certain amount of gamification attempted by the app, encouraging you to put together ’streaks; and awarding badges. You can buy into this if you wish, but there is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6096297/">some research</a> to say this <em>does</em> help motivation for health-related areas, so it’s understandable these kind of features are here.</p>
<p>Last but not least, you can find answers to all of your questions in the Zero Learn tab. It’s filled full of interesting information and blog-type posts that help get (and keep) you going. If you can’t find the answer here, it’s not worth knowing. Of course, only people that want to start or are already fasting will even download the app never mind about go digging in here, so my definition of interesting might be subjective.</p>
<p>If you want to get started intermittent fasting, or you need something to track your cycles going forward – look <a href="https://www.zerofasting.com/">no further than Zero</a>. I can’t find a bad word to say about it, and it’s become invaluable to me.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Health is by far the most important thing for me to think about. I have been to the bottom and know what happens if I don’t take care of myself, and everything suffers. Around three years ago, I discovered intermittent fasting and its time for me to share what it has done for my life.</p>
<p>The reason I am writing this is that fasting seems to be the new self-help buzz word. All the meditation and mindful new buzz are being replaced by guides on how to fast, and blogs about why you should fast. With it comes massive skepticism, people are naturally fearful of anything being pushed and marketed. However, along with mindfulness, fasting is much more than marketing, possessing numerous benefits.</p>
<p>I have been following a pretty strict 16:8 intermittent fast for more than a year. For the year before that, I was a hardcore 18:8 faster, and nothing broke my stride. All these numbers mean very little if you don’t know what I am referring too. The first number is the number of hours between my last meal and my next one as a minimum, and the second one is the number of hours I can eat for. So if I finish my evening mean at 7 pm, no calories go into my body before 11 am the next day at the earliest.</p>
<p>When I say pretty strict, I mean it, I eat breakfast sometimes at weekends if we are doing something or if my body needs it. But during the week I am dead on 16:8, and slowly increasing this to 17:7. I am currently using an iOS app called Zero to track this and record all of my other vitals to see any patterns – I will write about this in more detail later.</p>
<p>By not eating for periods of the day, my body feels much more in rhythm than ever before. With this comes a mental clarity I have not felt before, I am more engaged with tasks and don’t feel the ‘fog’ some people describe feeling after a large meal. Gone is any notion of struggling through afternoons of work, I no longer get bloated from meals, and I have much more energy at all points in the day.</p>
<p>Depending on your relationship to food, all the above will seem really easy or impossibly hard. Many people smoothly go many hours without eating but do so sporadically, and I think the pattern of fasting is essential. Reflected in my metabolism and my digestive processes being reliant on eating at specific points. Such is my routine it has allowed me to cut out any thought of breakfast easily, and restrict my calorie intake to one more suited to a healthy lifestyle. Intermittent fasting has made such a real difference to both my mental and physical health that I want people to know that all the buzz words and hype point to an improvement you could make to your life.</p>
<p>There will always be a company to try and sell things to you, but not all hype is worth ignoring.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2020/02/07/healthcare-consent-and.html"><h1 class="p-name">Healthcare Consent And The Tech That Ruined It</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When I walked into a cold doctors office at Nottingham City hospital early in October 2017, I wasn’t thinking very straight at all. At the second time of asking we had been given a place in a project that would sequence mine, my wife and my daughters entire DNA to find errors. Lucie was already seven, and after a couple of false starts, we were still pushing to find a reason for her disability. The <a class="u-reply-to" href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/about-genomics-england/the-100000-genomes-project/">100,000 genome project</a> promised to find the expected error in one of Lucie genes and report back in 1-2 years.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until reading the March edition of Wired that my eyes came across the words 100,000 genomes project and “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-019-0570-7?proof=true19">broad consent</a>” that my preverbal ears pricked up. Almost three years later, and mere days after <a href="/2020/01/31/the-diagnosis-relief.html">receiving the results</a>, was the first time I had even thought about where and who I had given my data to. But it’s not data, it’s me, who exactly now held a copy of the building blocks of me? The fact that the very essence as a person is recorded by someone else is chilling, but do I have any idea who that someone is and where it will go?</p>
<p>I signed a whole heap of consent forms before giving blood. They have an excellent website that tells me a load of information about the different levels of consent. Not once have I considered this until now, I mean how on earth can you be expected to understand what you agree to when dangled the carrot of diagnosis.</p>
<p>I am in no way saying that I was pushed into giving my consent, but I wasn’t in a position to understand what giving consent meant in this situation. Never mind about considering its ramifications as to who had access to my genetic data. I wanted answers to my daughter’s problems. All the consent boxes were explained to me as well as they could be by a nurse, but the reality is if they had said it came at the cost of 10 spam emails a day and two house visits every other Sunday I would have still signed on the dotted line.</p>
<p>Much like a person applying for a loan that felt compelled to take out PPI insurance – I wanted access to the possible results, more than I worried about what me signing in a whole booklet of content forms meant.</p>
<p>Of course, because this is a very modern problem, only in recent years have we even raised the question of our data being used, never mind our health information. Tech firms have spoilt even the word personal data, tarnished the price of giving consent, and levelled un-needed stress on the terms “approved third parties”.</p>
<h2>The Building Blocks Of Me</h2>
<p>The NHS has now sequenced my entire DNA and is keeping this on file, along with almost everything else I can imagine. They can make a pretty good guess at what will become of me when I’m old, what drugs will work best on me and a bucket load of other things I don’t understand. In 1990 this would have been the best situation imaginable. An agency tasked with looking after me knows everything about me and can treat me better; it is a perfect dream.</p>
<p>In 2020, we live in a world of corporations being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/08/nhs-gives-amazon-free-use-of-health-data-under-alexa-advice-deal">given access to health data by the NHS</a>. Others gaining it through promises of how much of your DNA comes from obscure places and then <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2229828-23andme-has-sold-the-rights-to-develop-a-drug-based-on-its-users-dna/">using it for their gain</a>, and a whole range of issues going on surrounding almost everything we are as a person. Health data doesn’t feel like personal data; it doesn’t feel like it matters in the same way that a tech firm can see all my pictures of cats, or know how many times I dismiss my wife’s phones calls. It feels very unimportant and at the same time, the most crucial thing in the world.</p>
<p>I am not overly distressed if Apple knows that I went for four ruins this week, and what my average heart rate is. However, I am uncomfortable with Amazon knowing that one drug works best on me than another version and that I am likely to get prostate cancer before I’m 70. Even when data is anonymised, it doesn’t take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_re-identification">many data points to make it relevant again</a>.</p>
<p>What I need to make clear is that at no point does this project sell or give my data to Amazon, I am talking in broad strokes here. The fact remains that given the same situation again, I would not change anything. We gained a <a href="/2020/01/31/the-diagnosis-relief.html">massive benefit from taking part</a>. One that I would put up with years of spam emails and telephone calls in exchange. The real outcry is that I shouldn’t even have to think about this.</p>
<p>Technology firms have stollen our data, or at the very least been less than transparent in its harvesting. They have ruined my trust in giving consent to anyone. Even dealing with an organisation such as the NHS, that aims to offer a vast range of benefits, I am still looking for the catch. For the revenue stream that makes me their product.</p>
<p>Firms will continue to ruin experiences for those that are asking for legal consent such as the 100,000 genomes project because of the connotations now surrounding data collection. They may even stop organisations in their tracks because of the hurdles involved – yet they still carry on regardless. They are tamely regulated, unapologetic brazen and impossibly huge to comprehend. Our data will never be our data in the future, and the biggest loser is already us.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>This feels like the end of a nine-year journey, but also the start of a new one. Its started on the 23rd June 2010, when I welcomed my daughter into this world and ended on Tuesday when we finally got a diagnosis for her issues.</p>
<p>We already had two false starts quite early on. Having a semi-diagnosis to them be ruled out by MRI. Initial genetic testing resulted in no answers, but almost three years ago, we were offered the chance to take part in the <a href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/about-genomics-england/the-100000-genomes-project/">100,000 genomes project</a> – and this has found a diagnosis.</p>
<p>Lucie has a ridiculously rare genetic condition called (ready for this one) <a href="https://www.rarechromo.org/media/information/Chromosome%20%205/MEF2c">mef2c haploinsufficiency syndrome</a>.  A condition that only affects around 100 people in the world, but its effects run deep and affect everything she does. As much as this changes anything about the care and difficulties we face – it is hard for me to sum up my feelings.</p>
<h2>Parental Vindication</h2>
<p>This is the only word I can think of to describe my feelings at this moment in time. As much as I knew that all of Lucie issues were because of her disability, and all of the stress that comes with it was no-ones fault. I still felt responsible and knew that some people thought that at least some of the things we experienced were because of our parenting.</p>
<p>Yet as the doctor read off the issues associated with the condition, it was if he were describing Lucie thoroughly. The image on the front of the information leaflet could be Lucie in a few years. Now all I can feel is relief and vindication for Lucie’s issues.</p>
<p>The weight of feeling responsible has been lifted after nine years, and I have no words to describe the feeling. It is one that I will deal with over the coming weeks and months, but I am already starting to feel the effects.</p>
<p>A diagnosis makes no difference in the way I treat Lucie, it makes no difference to Lucie herself, but it lifts the weight that was becoming too large to bear. I am so thankful that the NHS gave us this opportunity to go so in-depth with genetic sequencing and make such a difference to our lives.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Stuart Heritage <a href="https://apple.news/AZbs37eluSVqIMiPzi2mMKA">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A psychologist at Pennsylvania State University asked 960 participants whether certain activities registered as masculine or feminine. Basic environmental housekeeping, such as recycling and taking reusable bags to the shops, were seen as feminine. As a result, some men avoided these activities out of fear that they made them look effeminate. In short, a whale just suffocated on a 10p carrier bag because you were worried that a checkout assistant might see you putting your veg in a cotton tote and try to flog you some discount mascara. Great job, masculinity.</p></blockquote>
<p>What. What did I just read.</p>
<p>Some men avoid doing the recycling or taking a reusable bag to the supermarket because they don’t want to look ‘girly’. What level of idiot do you have to be for this to be true about you. That’s not being masculine, that’s being a complete moron.</p>
<p>These thought patterns show a distinct lack of confidence in both yourself and doubt in your masculinity. I don’t usually go with all this toxic masculinity thing, but this is another level of weirdness.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>To motivate myself to write more, I’ve been reading more. Not just online posts but magazines and books. Looking to subscriptions service and news aggregators, despite <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/apple-news-forcing/">my initial hate</a> – Apple News won me over.</p>
<p>It turns out I didn’t need to use it more; I didn’t need to ‘train the algorithm’, I just needed to turn off the news part! You see, I hate viewing or reading the news – it is that simple. It is full of twisted and corrupted stores that are either designed or portrayed in such a way to manipulate your emotions.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" title="Apple-news-settings-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4b3bfa49a1.jpg" alt="Apple news settings 1" /></figure>
<p>There is a way to do this, but it’s hidden away in the settings titled “Restrict Stories in Today”. Not a great label for a toggle that should be much easier to find, but I would presume Apple doesn’t want you to turn it on. Go to Settings &gt; News and toggle this to on.</p>
<p>Now all you will see are channels you have subscribed to in the Today tab. No more depressing politics, no more news you don’t want to see, just what you want.</p>
<p>There are downsides to this, the discovery of new channels can be more difficult, and you might not be kept as upto date with current affairs as you once were. Be a little more mindful of not creating an echo chamber, and you should get on much better. I am now much more open to subscribing to Apple News+, and many of the channels I am now following are News+ channels. So there is a benefit to Apple in the long run – subscription all the things!</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It isn’t very often I tap away on my keyboard in rage, but today is an exception to the rule. Publishing something in the heat of the moment is a stupid idea; I have a few hours to calm down and see if my emotions dissipate. If you see this, I have not changed my outlook overnight and indeed – the UK government hates disabled people.</p>
<p>The ridiculous pressure the current Conservative Government are putting on those in need is sickening. It has been progressively getting worse for the last few years and sees no sign of stopping. Currently, we do not claim, nor are entitled to any benefits other than my daughter’s disability allowance. We are now used such things and are lucky to be in a position that we don’t rely on them.</p>
<p>With that said, we are starting to struggle to get regular, expected things from our local authority and this came to a head yesterday with an entitlement to incontinence products. For those of you that haven’t read many of my previous posts, nor know Lucie, she has a severely restricted understanding of the world. She doesn’t know what a toilet is, never mind about have the ability to use one.</p>
<p>My wife attended what was pitched to us as a ‘review’ of her current situation, and to see if she has the right prescription. Currently as it stands we receive 3 months supply of nappies at a time, this being working to a maximum of 4 nappies a day. If you’ve ever cared with a person that is unable to use the toilet, be it a baby, or any age really, you will know how many times a day you need to change an individual – and four is simply laughable.</p>
<p>We get through this by topping up our allocation with purchasing half this number again, every other delivery. So every six months roughly we are buying the same nappy, in bulk to make sure we don’t have any issues.</p>
<p>On attending the appointment, my wife was quizzed on how much Luice drinks, asked questions along the lines of “do you think that’s too much”, and made to generally feel horrible. They also question why Lucie had not been toilet trained and asked what we were doing to sort this situation out. My wife is now expected to reel off everything that is wrong with Lucie, justify what and how much Luice eats and drinks simply because that’s what’s expected.</p>
<p>As part of Lucie’s condition, she consumes quite a bit of high-calorie drinks along with milk with added fibre and calories. According to the local authority this doesn’t class as a drink, is in fact ‘food’ and doesn’t explain why we need more than three nappies a day.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right, the UK government now expects my nine-year-old daughter to only be changed twice a day! Frankly, this is a ridiculous amount of incontinence product and is not hygienic in the slightest. We must now pretty much double what the government gives us – out of our pocket. Simply because we are expected to toilet train a little girl with serve development delay who is non-communicative — not an impossible task, but not one that is going to happen overnight. It took me six months to teach her how to stir a spoon in a bowl.</p>
<p>You might argue that these types of purchases are exactly what the disability living allowance is for. But too retort, this is just the latest in a long line of cuts and removals of things we are expected to foot the bill for. The small amount we get goes in Lucie bank account and stays there to pay for long term care when we are too old to do so as I can’t rely on our government to do so any longer.</p>
<p>This current government is a shambles, aimed at looking after those that are in the best places and brushing everyone else under the carpet, and it makes me feel sick.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Holly B. Shakya  Nicholas A. Christakis <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-new-more-rigorous-study-confirms-the-more-you-use-facebook-the-worse-you-feel">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, our results showed that, while real-world social networks were positively associated with overall well-being, the use of Facebook was negatively associated with overall well-being. These results were particularly strong for mental health; most measures of Facebook use in one year predicted a decrease in mental health in a later year. We found consistently that both liking others’ content and clicking links significantly predicted a subsequent reduction in self-reported physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I can take it any more. Studies prove that Facebook makes you feel like crap. They do <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-51166339">awful</a> <a href="https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-marketing/advertising/facebook-refuses-ban-political-adverts-328619">thing</a> <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/leaked-memo-shows-facebook-executive-saying-company-was-responsible-donald-trump-getting-elected-1480946">after</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51200446">awful</a> <a href="https://consent.yahoo.com/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_0cf04ebd-67b5-4f06-97e6-00277b159d78&amp;lang=&amp;inline=false">thing</a>, yet people still use the garbage platform.</p>
<p>Facebook is the single worst thing to ever happen to the internet or society in general. It makes us sad, so narcissistic we annoy others, and splits us apart from other humans. All so we can share memes and check out or relatives we don’t care about enough to keep in touch with properly.</p>
<p>Doesn’t seem like a great exchange to me.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I don’t care about the number of visits to my blog, I certainly <a href="https://gr36.com/i-dont-feel-interesting/">don’t feel interesting enough</a> to get the volume I do, but I do value what readers bring to me. So I have started to look at behaviour stats for my blog and try and work out some engagement with my readers, with a view in increasing feedback.</p>
<p>These sorts of stats <em>do</em> matter to me, because I want to see when and where people stop reading and understand how to keep people engaged with me. Not because I want to manipulate them and monetise them like the standard technology obsession. There is no attention economy here. I do want to build up a conversation with them and encourage replies to my posts.</p>
<p>I am not obsessed with this, but much as <a href="https://gabz.me/2020/01/10/engage-like-a.html">Gabz wrote about</a>, I want some real interaction from my posts. I desire conversation and even push back. Reading a post and nothing happening is as useful as a Twitter ‘like’. I want interaction from people, and the best way for me to do this is to look at where readers go to on my site and what clicks.</p>
<p>One down side is that Google Analytics is almost impossible to get the hang of straight away for a lowly blogger like me, so I might have to look at alternatives shortly. I have also found that lots of organic traffic from search seems to bounce straight off so I may have a task on my hands. But I’m going to try. In the mean time I am learning new skills and understanding user flow so this task is not a complete waste of time.</p>
<p>Stats still don’t rank high on my priorities for reader numbers or website clicks, Humans do – so how do I talk to them?</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I try not to be self-deprecating as much as I can; however I do suffer quite a lot with imposter syndrome. The great thing is, I have learnt not to check my blog stats, I’m not bothered about podcast downloads and I sure as hell don’t care how many people follow me on social media. Yet every time I do stumble over the figures, I am always surprised because I don’t think I am interesting enough.</p>
<p>I have no idea why people come to my blog, but they do, and I am happy that they get here. Some arrive through Google searches, which lead me down one <a href="https://gr36.com/started-showing-ads/">path the other day</a>, but some do still come from social media. I ask myself why?</p>
<p>When I listen to other people on podcasts, and read others writing, they seem infinity more interesting than I think I am. With more to say on topics that I find really interesting. Does everyone feel like this? Is the fact that I am posting more made people realise how boring I am? These are the types of questions I ask myself regularly, and perhaps I am going crazy thinking about it.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Since Matter chose to <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/nucleus">remove all of their social sharing features</a>, I’ve lacked things to read. As much as they claim to have improved things in getting recommendations direct from Twitter, they really suck. There is nothing better than learning what the people around you are reading to let you know what to take a peek at, and I wish more services understood that.</p>
<p>I have a particular hatred <a href="/2021/01/10/american-politics-gets.html">of American politics</a> and its ability to worm its way into everything. Covering all of social media with its poison and then infiltrating everything that large-scale services suggest I should read. However, that issue is much larger than one topic. Matter now surfaces hardly any posts that I want to read, which means I don’t read as much. It is not clear how the recommendations work, but clearly, some people are reading these posts, but that person is not me.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/245e97bf49.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It sounds like I am ripping on one particular service, but I am not. In fact, I love Matter, it is one of the first apps I install on a new phone, but all services seem to do this now. Taking recommendations from too broad a selection of people, or making all the suggested posts human-curated. This may work for some people, but again, not I.</p>
<p>In a world of algorithms and intelligent services, you would think that someone, somewhere would be able to learn what I enjoy reading and recommend me more like it. I would rather not live in an echo chamber, but I want to avoid having to put in as much work as I do to find enjoyable articles. This is precisely the type of useful application new technology should have instead of manipulating people on social media, can’t it just find me things to read… please.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The idea of Stoptober is, at least in the UK, to stop drinking or smoking. It’s used as a marketing gimmick by so many companies that have a vested interest in selling you things, but the premise is great.</p>
<p>Considering myself and my wife don’t smoke, nor drink very much, we have decided to instead stop our negative thoughts. After both suffering with our <a href="/2022/07/27/210805.html">mental health</a> for a few months, it is the ideal opportunity to try to get back to feeling like ourselves again.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a2293632d8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>How on earth are we going to do this, you might ask. Well, we’ve chosen to meditate every day for a month. It’s a practice that’s dropped off in our lives recently and a good opportunity to introduce it to our son, who’s also joining us on this journey.</p>
<p>Day one is already completed after a nightmare setting up our family plan to <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a> to include my son&rsquo;s Android phone. Hopefully, this might be the kick up the backside we both need and improve our thought patterns and concentration.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Russell Brandom for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/22/23365781/tiktok-youtube-bootleg-ratio-social-platforms-original-content">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I call it the Bootleg Ratio: the delicate balance between A) content created by users specifically for the platform and B) semi-anonymous clout-chasing accounts drafting off the audience. Any platform will have both, but as B starts to overtake A, users will have less and less reason to visit and creators will have less and less reason to post. In short, it’s a sign that the interesting stuff about the platform is starting to die out.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a fascinating point and one that is further expanded to partially explain the inability of Vine to cash in on its network. There&rsquo;s a slow change in the way people relate to their social network of choice, they all start out small and lovely places to be, but once they get to a tipping point it&rsquo;s all downhill. What was once a space for sharing becomes yet another avenue to distribute on, and becomes less and less unique.</p>
<p>Instagram has gone through several cycles of this and seems to be on its way down again, whereas it hasn’t really stuck on Twitter. As Russel points out, “What’s left is often depressing and unpleasant, but it’s uniquely Twitter” — and if that isn’t a perfect description, I don’t know what is.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It was only fairly recently I came to the realisation that I was chronically lonely. Granted, there are a few of you out there that I do consider friends that I have met online, but I’ve never had many real life friends. Those that I organically picked up through school or college now have lives of their own and drifted away.</p>
<p>As a defence mechanism for more than a decade I convinced myself I didn’t need people anyway. Built a persona of some kind of tough guy loner and even convinced myself for a bit. I had a sales job where I spoke to loads of people daily, but it was all an act to fill a role that I enjoyed quite a bit. It allowed me to be the person that I used to be in school and forget myself for a while.</p>
<p>Today is my birthday, and I’ve spent it alone with my dog. Exercising, reading and waiting for my family to finish school and work. Today has been a bit like bunking off school, you get the day off but everyone else is doing other things anyway, so you just hang around. I honestly have nothing to do and no one to see, and that’s a tiny bit sad to say out loud.</p>
<p>There’s no cry for help here, but more of a public display that it’s OK to be lonely. Especially as a man, it’s really difficult to express those feelings. You don’t have to hide it away, it’s OK to need and want other people around you. As great as my dog is, he’s not enough to make me feel good on my birthday, and that’s ok for me to feel. I am thankful for the few messages that I have received and realise that I am still an amazingly lucky guy to be where I am.</p>
<p>I’m just lonely, and an introvert. Is that even possible?</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The importance of having something that you can fully focus on and forget the world for a bit is becoming more and more obvious to me. Perhaps it is because the world sucks and the moment, and there is always some kind of bad news just around the corner. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just that I am <a href="/2022/07/30/placebo.html">struggling</a> more than I ever thought possible, but I just need to switch off for a while and <a href="/2022/07/27/210805.html">not feel bad about it</a>.</p>
<p>Some people find this in computer games, some find it in reading, but mine is writing and tinkering with my blog. I can only truly escape from the world for a bit whilst typing away on my keyboard doing my thing, and I only figured this out because I haven’t been doing it so much lately. Between <a href="/2022/09/09/caught-again.html">COVID</a>, work and just feeling burnt out when I get home, my personal projects have been on the back burner more than normal.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I have still been publishing quite a bit lately, but this has been from my phone. An experience that I quite enjoy as it allows me to publish on the go and be a bit more personal about things that are happening currently, but doesn’t quite give the same escape. Whilst using my laptop, I tend to let my mind wander a bit and don’t end up scrolling <a href="/2022/07/31/of-course-i.html">social media so much</a>. I might start writing a post, and then tidy up the code on my blog, then perhaps edit some image sin Lightroom to publish. Just flit around doing random things I enjoy and not have to worry about anything else.</p>
<p>There’s no solution here, at least not one that I have worked out yet, but I wonder what random escapes others have. Something that seems so mundane or perhaps that others would hate gives me so much joy, so I bet we’ve all got some weird things we need to do to get through life.</p>

      <p>Starting this post took longer to work out than almost any post I have written. Where do you start when the subject you want to talk about is so devastating, but still important to think about. I guess fair warning, this post could upset some people as it discusses children passing away.</p>
<p>I can’t even imagine the feelings that our friends feel every year their little boy&rsquo;s birthday comes around. They have suffered the worst thing to happen to any parent and had two of their children pass away. Both suffering from a genetic heart condition that was undiscovered until their second boy died soon after birth.</p>

<p>They are both amazing and a credit to their family with the way that they remember them both so publicly. Tonight we went to their home to celebrate what would have been his second birthday. Each year we remember him, as we did a few weeks ago with his brother, by releasing balloons. They each have little messages on from us all as a little token of our loss.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/508276df04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The event is not a somber affair, but more of a celebration and a thank you for being in our lives. It’s hard to put into words how much we miss them both, and by releasing balloons it allows us to pause and think of him as they float away. A quiet and apt event which we all stand and watch with our friends. Whereas I would want to bury myself away and not be around people, they have an entirely different way of dealing with the grief and one that helps us all.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/65af8675c3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I always end up leaving their home with a renewed outlook on life. If they can deal with something so devastating, then the framing that we all put on our troubles seems insignificant. By celebrating their children each year, so publicly, they are helping others in more ways than they realise.</p>
<p>They have set up a charity in their boys names and are also helping more families to discover this genetic condition, so they can receive the help they need. I feel lucky to know them and find them both amazingly inspiring.</p>

      <p>Seth Godin writing about <a href="https://seths.blog/2022/09/its-just-not-that-good/">things being good</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not that good for who? If you mean to say, “I don’t like it, it doesn’t appeal to me,” then that’s what you should say.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you have enough expertise and domain knowledge to say, “I understand what has appealed to the audience you’re trying to serve, and this isn’t going to work.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Weird that this post should come up when I am consuming more tech reviews than I think I have ever done. Of course, the vast number of reviews come away with no conclusion and tell you everything is great, but a good number of them draw conclusions based on their very limited and niche usage.</p>
<p>The decision on a product or service is good or bad is based on your experience. Some reviewers can think about how more general users would feel about things, but many do not. They extrapolate from their opinion, which is often clouded with other factors, and draw conclusions based solely on themselves. Using this to influence purchases from other people.</p>

      <p>When I was younger, I had to go with my grandad to church. He was, what I used to think of as a hardcore Christian, that was until I had been exposed to Americans. He never missed a service, and I hated going.</p>
<p>All the excuses I could think of were saved up for the weekend to try to get out of it. I honestly despised going with every fiber of my being. I was young, and you’re supposed to hate things like this, and it didn’t help that every second of it was terrible. The place was cold, the people were weird, and I had much better things to be doing with my time on a Sunday morning. Yet now I would give anything to go with him.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/964da2f363.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>He passed away some years ago now, and I look back on even the times I would rather not be there as some of the best times of my life. You see, there will always be a last time you have to do something you dislike — but when it&rsquo;s gone you will miss it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sat up at <a href="/2022/08/30/the-world-is.html">night for hours and hours</a> with my daughter Lucie. Through whole nights just holding her because she needed me close to settle. There have been times that my son requires something doing and all I want to do is sit down for a bit. I will always do them though, with a smile on my face, because there will be a time when they won’t need me any more, and I’ll miss them.</p>
<p>You never get the time back, even the times you hate. However, from experience I know how badly you will want to live that experience again should the worst happen. Even the times you hate is precious, appreciate it.</p>

      <p>I guess one of the things you realise when you have kids, or you&rsquo;re around a lot of them, is that they all have weird obsessions. You expect the usual superheroes, or horses or fire engines, but my daughter is obsessed with shoes!</p>
<p>She just loves them, and I have no idea where it has come from. Granted, she is <a href="/2020/01/31/the-diagnosis-relief.html">disabled</a>, but since she could crawl around, she always had a shoe nearby. Where most kids need teddies or blankets to settle down, Lucie has an emotional support shoe (it&rsquo;s brand new). My Adidas Samba has even been down to an operation with her.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ab71d1e449.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Our house is just littered with shoes for her to play with, or just carry around, as well as the usual musical or flashing toys. Perhaps it is because she spent much of her life on the floor due to mobility issues, but at this point I am just speculating.</p>
<p>If you ever visit our house, she will chase you around until she decides your shoes are not nice enough, or you take them off so she can have a proper look.</p>
<p>It causes some weird looks from people that don&rsquo;t know her, but that&rsquo;s just Lucie — and she loves shoes.</p>

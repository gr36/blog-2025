<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>There‚Äôs an old adage: today‚Äôs news is tomorrow‚Äôs chip paper. For anyone outside the UK, it essentially means that news‚Äîand the attention it garners‚Äîmoves on fast. Nowhere is this truer than when it comes to products, influencers, and technology. That said, some topics tend to be very cyclical (note-taking apps on micro.blog, anyone?), and fortunately, the discussion about Substack has cycled back to the forefront.</p>
<p>Before <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2024/11/19/dont-call-it-a-substack/">Anil Dash‚Äôs excellent post</a> a few days ago, I was disappointed to see how many people had either returned to Substack or started using it anew. If you‚Äôve forgotten, there was a strong movement to abandon Substack only 11 months ago‚Äîa movement I supported by deleting my subscriptions, waiting for my favourite newsletters to <a href="https://www.platformer.news/why-platformer-is-leaving-substack/">move away due to Substack‚Äôs ‚ÄúNazi problem‚Äù</a>.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt up for debate. There‚Äôs no argument over whether there was an issue‚Äîthere was, and there still is. This <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@decoderpod/video/7221602731998498094">video from Decoder</a> should be motivation enough to pack your stuff up and leave a platform that won‚Äôt remove content expressing racism as blatantly as Nilay puts it to their CEO. Like I said, there‚Äôs no debate here. Unless you‚Äôre <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/regarding_and_well_against_substack">John Gruber</a> because, ‚ÄúIf I never see it, I don‚Äôt care.‚Äù</p>
<h2 id="its-not-wordpress">It‚Äôs Not WordPress</h2>
<p>Another argument I‚Äôve heard is that it doesn‚Äôt matter because Substack is ‚Äújust a hosting company.‚Äù Admittedly, it was a pretty great one‚Äîuntil all of this started. Free hosting for your newsletter, blog, and podcast‚Äîwhere‚Äôs the catch?</p>
<p>Well, here it is, folks. The fact is, Substack is not just a host for your content like WordPress, Ghost, or micro.blog. It uses your content to pitch others on their platform, recommends other publications alongside yours, and pushes its users toward its Twitter clone, Notes, which allows people to post some truly terrible things.</p>
<p>As Anil points out, Substack has now become a noun. When people say things like ‚Äúsubscribe to my Substack‚Äù (which they really shouldn‚Äôt), you can‚Äôt use the passive ‚Äújust a hosting company‚Äù excuse. WordPress may host your website, and its CEO might go a bit crazy and start a feud with another billionaire, but that doesn‚Äôt directly impact your blog. However, when Substack uses your content to legitimise some of the worst society has to offer, it‚Äôs not just me being annoyed‚Äîyou should be annoyed too.</p>
<h2 id="forgetting">Forgetting</h2>
<p>Yet here we are, months later. Substack still exists. High-profile people don‚Äôt care and continue to open new accounts instead of searching for better options. And the world keeps spinning. It‚Äôs remarkable how quickly people forget. Even when something as serious as this happens, it only takes a few weeks to blow over. Perhaps I expect too much as someone who consumes a large volume of publications.</p>
<p>I have no issue with where you choose to host your content‚Äîthat‚Äôs entirely up to you as a writer. However, much like the people still buying Teslas or still posting on X, know that people will be judging you. Most importantly, post somewhere you can own your content. Please.</p>

     <p>There is nothing I enjoy more than an insightful discussion on notebooks, and hearing Sam Altman on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0">How I Write Podcast</a> was a fascinating listen. I made a few notes whilst walking the dog this morning, but before I got a chance to go over them, <a href="ttps://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305832/sam-altman-pen-notebook-muji-uniball">this excellent rebuttal</a> from Liz Lopatto at The Verge made me laugh out loud.</p>
<p>My favourite quote from the post sums up my thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not rip pages out of my notebook regularly because I am not deranged</p></blockquote>
<p>This part really made me wonder what on earth is going on in the world. Sam describes ripping pages out of his spiral notebook (this being one of the reason he uses a spiral version) and throwing them on the floor for his cleaner to pick up.</p>
<p>Not putting them in the bin himself, he‚Äôs too busy for that. He just throws them on the floor and relies on his housekeeper to pick them up whenever they are around. The whole podcast / video is well worth watching, but this part in particular is really revealing about the personality of the man in charge of Open Ai.</p>
<p>As Liz writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a man who has not carefully considered his tools and expects someone else to pick up after him. That does explain a lot about OpenAI, doesn‚Äôt it?</p></blockquote>
<p>As saside note, spiral notebooks are not my thing, neither is the pen he writes with, but there‚Äôs no getting around the fact that <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2023/05/17/get-a-notebook.html">writing in a notebook is the best</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I‚Äôm chilling in a coffee shop, writing a blog post about echo chambers, I don‚Äôt move to the table next to me to listen closer to the muppets there talking about how children shouldn‚Äôt be immunised against deadly viruses because Bob down the pub told them about mind controlling nano bots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A perfect analogy. People act like I have to see all this toxic crap online. Or imply I‚Äôm weak because I might get ‚Äòtriggered‚Äô.</p>
<p>But I just want a nice place to hang out and that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue.</p>

<p>These are people that completely miss the point of social media. These are people that have ruined it for the rest of us. These are people that I don‚Äôt want to see in my feed.</p>

<p>Companies talk so much about products that don‚Äôt exist. Apple say ‚Äúcoming later this year‚Äù more than I ever expected. And don‚Äôt even get me started on Orion</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>There’s an old adage: today’s news is tomorrow’s chip paper. For anyone outside the UK, it essentially means that news—and the attention it garners—moves on fast. Nowhere is this truer than when it comes to products, influencers, and technology. That said, some topics tend to be very cyclical (note-taking apps on micro.blog, anyone?), and fortunately, the discussion about Substack has cycled back to the forefront.</p>
<p>Before <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2024/11/19/dont-call-it-a-substack/">Anil Dash’s excellent post</a> a few days ago, I was disappointed to see how many people had either returned to Substack or started using it anew. If you’ve forgotten, there was a strong movement to abandon Substack only 11 months ago—a movement I supported by deleting my subscriptions, waiting for my favourite newsletters to <a href="https://www.platformer.news/why-platformer-is-leaving-substack/">move away due to Substack’s “Nazi problem”</a>.</p>
<p>This isn’t up for debate. There’s no argument over whether there was an issue—there was, and there still is. This <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@decoderpod/video/7221602731998498094">video from Decoder</a> should be motivation enough to pack your stuff up and leave a platform that won’t remove content expressing racism as blatantly as Nilay puts it to their CEO. Like I said, there’s no debate here. Unless you’re <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/regarding_and_well_against_substack">John Gruber</a> because, “If I never see it, I don’t care.”</p>
<h2 id="its-not-wordpress">It’s Not WordPress</h2>
<p>Another argument I’ve heard is that it doesn’t matter because Substack is “just a hosting company.” Admittedly, it was a pretty great one—until all of this started. Free hosting for your newsletter, blog, and podcast—where’s the catch?</p>
<p>Well, here it is, folks. The fact is, Substack is not just a host for your content like WordPress, Ghost, or micro.blog. It uses your content to pitch others on their platform, recommends other publications alongside yours, and pushes its users toward its Twitter clone, Notes, which allows people to post some truly terrible things.</p>
<p>As Anil points out, Substack has now become a noun. When people say things like “subscribe to my Substack” (which they really shouldn’t), you can’t use the passive “just a hosting company” excuse. WordPress may host your website, and its CEO might go a bit crazy and start a feud with another billionaire, but that doesn’t directly impact your blog. However, when Substack uses your content to legitimise some of the worst society has to offer, it’s not just me being annoyed—you should be annoyed too.</p>
<h2 id="forgetting">Forgetting</h2>
<p>Yet here we are, months later. Substack still exists. High-profile people don’t care and continue to open new accounts instead of searching for better options. And the world keeps spinning. It’s remarkable how quickly people forget. Even when something as serious as this happens, it only takes a few weeks to blow over. Perhaps I expect too much as someone who consumes a large volume of publications.</p>
<p>I have no issue with where you choose to host your content—that’s entirely up to you as a writer. However, much like the people still buying Teslas or still posting on X, know that people will be judging you. Most importantly, post somewhere you can own your content. Please.</p>

     <p>There is nothing I enjoy more than an insightful discussion on notebooks, and hearing Sam Altman on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pxmdmlJCG0">How I Write Podcast</a> was a fascinating listen. I made a few notes whilst walking the dog this morning, but before I got a chance to go over them, <a href="ttps://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305832/sam-altman-pen-notebook-muji-uniball">this excellent rebuttal</a> from Liz Lopatto at The Verge made me laugh out loud.</p>
<p>My favourite quote from the post sums up my thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not rip pages out of my notebook regularly because I am not deranged</p></blockquote>
<p>This part really made me wonder what on earth is going on in the world. Sam describes ripping pages out of his spiral notebook (this being one of the reason he uses a spiral version) and throwing them on the floor for his cleaner to pick up.</p>
<p>Not putting them in the bin himself, he’s too busy for that. He just throws them on the floor and relies on his housekeeper to pick them up whenever they are around. The whole podcast / video is well worth watching, but this part in particular is really revealing about the personality of the man in charge of Open Ai.</p>
<p>As Liz writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a man who has not carefully considered his tools and expects someone else to pick up after him. That does explain a lot about OpenAI, doesn’t it?</p></blockquote>
<p>As saside note, spiral notebooks are not my thing, neither is the pen he writes with, but there’s no getting around the fact that <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2023/05/17/get-a-notebook.html">writing in a notebook is the best</a>!</p>

<p>I like the way that Meta can start to implement the things users have been asking for just in time to see a lot of their user base leave. The best part is, I would presume, the users that really benefit from these updates don’t really want to use a Meta platform anyway 👋</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I’m chilling in a coffee shop, writing a blog post about echo chambers, I don’t move to the table next to me to listen closer to the muppets there talking about how children shouldn’t be immunised against deadly viruses because Bob down the pub told them about mind controlling nano bots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A perfect analogy. People act like I have to see all this toxic crap online. Or imply I’m weak because I might get ‘triggered’.</p>
<p>But I just want a nice place to hang out and that shouldn’t be an issue.</p>

<p>These are people that completely miss the point of social media. These are people that have ruined it for the rest of us. These are people that I don’t want to see in my feed.</p>

<p>Companies talk so much about products that don’t exist. Apple say “coming later this year” more than I ever expected. And don’t even get me started on Orion</p>

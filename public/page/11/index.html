  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I came across an interesting tale about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere_2">Biosphere 2</a>, a massive scientific experiment in Arizona designed to mimic Earth’s ecosystems. Inside this controlled bubble, trees shot up at a rate that surprised everyone. Initially, this seemed like a win for the scientists—creating perfect conditions for growth. But then, these rapidly growing trees started dying unexpectedly.</p>
<p>The culprit? No wind. Yes, really. In their natural habitats, trees are exposed to wind, which actually helps them grow stronger by forcing them to stabilise and develop robust roots. But in the sheltered life of Biosphere 2, without these natural challenges, the trees lacked the resilience to sustain themselves.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we look at people who seem to be advancing rapidly and wonder about their secret. What we often don’t see is the “shelter” around them—whether that’s privilege, support, or resources—that might be helping them but also potentially weakening them in ways not immediately visible. They’re missing out on the &ldquo;winds&rdquo; of challenge that help strengthen and prepare us for the real world.</p>
<p>This whole situation has me thinking about the balance between protection and exposure. How much should we shield ourselves or others from the challenges of life? Are we nurturing resilience or inadvertently fostering fragility? Maybe it’s about finding that sweet spot where we&rsquo;re supported enough to thrive but still exposed enough to grow strong and resilient. Sometimes, the very things that make us feel safe can hold us back from developing the strength we truly need.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Have you ever looked at someone else&rsquo;s problem and immediately thought you knew the answer? It’s like being an armchair detective during a movie, confident in predicting the next turn of events and sure about what each character should do to avoid pitfalls. From the outside, everything seems obvious, especially when you&rsquo;re removed from any emotional entanglement. This kind of clarity can make it tempting to think that spotting problems and solving them should be straightforward.</p>
<p>However, when the challenge is yours, clarity often fades, and things aren&rsquo;t so simple. It&rsquo;s a lot like asking a toddler to solve for x in an algebra problem—they wouldn’t even know where to begin. Similarly, when we’re in the middle of our own issues, whether they&rsquo;re related to work, relationships, or personal growth, we can feel just as bewildered.</p>
<p>This difference in perspective, between an outsider and someone directly involved, largely stems from emotional connections. Our feelings can cloud our judgment, making even clear solutions seem obscured and complex decisions difficult to grasp. Being emotionally invested in our problems filters our perceptions and can significantly complicate the decision-making process.</p>
<p>When it is personal there is another layer of complexity. Every decision you make can have significant repercussions, adding pressure and making the &lsquo;correct&rsquo; path less obvious. This isn’t just a straightforward task like solving a math equation; it involves navigating emotional landscapes, social dynamics, and sometimes professional risks.</p>
<p>Navigating life’s challenges is thus more about understanding and managing our emotions than simply finding quick fixes. Recognizing our deep involvement in our problems is crucial. It doesn’t necessarily simplify the issues, but it does provide a clearer lens through which to view them. Starting to see our situations with this kind of thoughtful awareness might not immediately solve every problem, but it certainly helps us find our way forward, one step at a time.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2024/04/27/twitter-should-have.html"><h1 class="p-name">Twitter Should Have Been A Blog</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>As I rummaged through my old blog posts recently, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice a recurring theme: Twitter. Surprisingly, amid the clutter of musings and reflections, Twitter stood out as a significant part of my online presence. This got me thinking: What if Twitter had been designed as a full-fledged blogging platform from the get-go?</p>
<p>Throughout my blogging adventures, Twitter was always there—whether I was sharing intriguing discoveries, engaging with like-minded individuals, or contemplating its potential for growth. Yet, amid the chaos of tweet storms and fleeting thoughts, I couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that Twitter missed a golden opportunity by not embracing its potential as a blogging platform.</p>
<p>Picture this: a platform where you could share your thoughts, ideas, and experiences without the constraints of character limits or fragmented threads. A space where content could be effortlessly published and shared with your audience, regardless of its length or format. That&rsquo;s the essence of what Twitter should have been—a unified hub for expression and interaction.</p>
<p>Instead of hopping between platforms to consume different types of content, users could have enjoyed a seamless experience within Twitter itself. Whether you wanted to read thought-provoking essays, peruse captivating visuals, or watch engaging videos, everything would be conveniently housed under one roof. No more juggling between YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter to cater to your browsing needs.</p>
<p>While platforms like ActivityPub and Mastodon have made strides towards this vision, there&rsquo;s still a gap that needs to be bridged. Integrating diverse content types within a single platform requires careful curation and a seamless user experience—a challenge that remains unresolved for many. However, with innovations like Meta&rsquo;s Threads, there&rsquo;s hope for a more cohesive and comprehensive social media ecosystem.</p>
<p>Of course, achieving the ideal &ldquo;everything platform&rdquo; requires more than just technical prowess—it demands a deep understanding of user behaviour and preferences. Perhaps the key lies in a collaborative effort, drawing upon the collective wisdom of developers, designers, and users alike. In hindsight, Twitter&rsquo;s journey could have taken a different trajectory—one where it emerged not just as a microblogging platform, but as a versatile and all-encompassing space for expression.</p>

      <p>Cory Dransfeldt writing about <a href="https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/data-ownership-and-agency/">Data ownership and agency</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I control that data, it sits on infrastructure I manage, it&rsquo;s in a format I understand and I get the responsibility (or fun — let&rsquo;s go with that) of presenting it. I get agency and that agency is accompanied by the burden of maintenance, presentation and action. Convenience in exchange for control.</p></blockquote>
<p>As usual, Cory&rsquo;s take is measured, accurate, and raises some interesting points on the ownership of your data online. Many people have begun to think about these things now that the USA is finally preparing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/07/congress-privacy-deal-cantwell-rodgers/">legislation on privacy and personal data</a>. Of course, that isn&rsquo;t a worry for me, but this short statement prodded at something I was thinking about when moving my blog around in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>I really want to have an 11ty blog and keep all of my data to myself. I can then pull in whatever it is I want from around the web and display it in whichever way I choose. Thankfully, I am skilled enough to write a bit of code and get things going. It makes the most sense for me, but I just can&rsquo;t be bothered. I want to be able to post easily, post all sorts of things, and not have to worry about a thing - in exchange for that, I give up control.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I trust Manton and micro.blog more than any other platform; this is more control of how I can do things and, in some cases, what I can do. In exchange for being able to post easily and not have to deal with rebuild times and server things - my host calls the shots now. This will range from pretty much unlimited ability on platforms like WordPress to locked-down services like Hey World. Whoever it is you choose, as Cory writes, you get &ldquo;Convenience in exchange for control&rdquo;.</p>

      <p>A couple of days after completing the London Marathon, I&rsquo;ve had only a little time to process the experience. Not only is it an assault on your body, but also on your mind and senses for hours on end. I&rsquo;m very thankful to those who have <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024">supported me through sponsorship</a>, donations, or just words of encouragement. It was hard to get to the start line, but if you know me, then you will already know that nothing would have kept me from reaching the end.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were people who didn’t make it, including some very ill individuals who needed urgent medical attention, and I really hope they are okay. So this is nothing negative toward those who needed to pull out, but it&rsquo;s only when you take on these kinds of challenges that you realise just how much mental power it takes. I honestly think that just about anyone, given enough time, can physically push themselves, but it’s the mental toughness that gets you to that point.</p>
<p>For much of the run, your whole body is screaming at you to stop. It takes real energy to push that &ldquo;monkey brain&rdquo; out of the way and just keep going. I hadn&rsquo;t realised how much effort this takes until I couldn’t even concentrate enough to order food later that day. I had to keep turning to my wife and asking her to do things. As bizarre as that sounds, it&rsquo;s the truth; I was done. After the stress of training, raising money, traveling to London, getting to the start line, and everything else. As soon as I crossed the finish line, my brain just shut down for a bit.</p>
<p>The biggest message I get is congratulations on completing the marathon. It’s true, as my grandad would say, that wild horses couldn&rsquo;t have kept me away from the finish line, but it still took a deep effort to get there—and I owe a lot of it to the people who read my blog and follow me on social media. Thank you. Honestly. You all mean a lot to me.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Over the last few months, it has been challenging to balance my interests and focus. Indeed, I have wasted a lot of time moving things around and messing with my websites, but along with this I have found it difficult to do more than one ‘thing’ at a time. There’s something to be said about putting all your effort one way, but I enjoy lots of different creative things and don’t like neglecting other areas.</p>
<p>Take my blog writing for example. It comes in waves of inspiration and I can post lots of them for a few days straight, perhaps a few weeks if I am lucky, and then it dries up again. This usually co-insides with me doing something else, like developing things for my blog. Or perhaps spending some time taking photos. It appears that my brain cant be creative in more ways than one!</p>
<p>I decided a <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/04/09/phone-boredom.html">break away from social media</a> was best for me, and along with it came numerous blog posts because it was my only outlet. Since posting more to micro.blog I have <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/04/17/statuslog-microblog-plugin.html">developed</a> three plugins and so writing stopped almost all together (unless readme files count). This week I went to London and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/04/18/two-of-my.html">took plenty of photos</a>, so I have no doubt that writing will take a back seat again for a while.</p>
<p>It is as if something triggers in my brain and I can only see things one way for a while. When I am writing, my camera sits there gathering dust. Should I try to develop anything in that time, it often doesn’t go very well, and I have to push through it. The main thing I want to keep doing is posting to my blog, whilst trying to find a way to balance my varied interests, but currently it’s hard.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Display your omg.lol Statuslog on a micro.blog page.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/nowpage.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="set-up">Set Up</h2>
<p>Install the plugin from the <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/124">official plugin page</a>, or from Github by clicking design, edit theme, and then add new plugin. This will be available as an official plugin, but the submit page is currently broken.</p>
<p>Call the plugin anything you wish, copy in the <a href="https://github.com/gr36/status-log">URL from the Github page</a>, and click Add Plugin.</p>
<h3 id="add-shortcode">Add Shortcode</h3>
<p>Add the shortcode to the page you wish this to show on, for example, I have placed this on my home page but you could do this wherever you like.</p>
<p>Simply add the statuslog shortcode to your page wherever you want the updates to appear. I cannot put the shortcode here, even in a code block because micro.blog renders this! For a copy and past option, head to <a href="https://github.com/gr36/status-log">Github</a>.</p>
<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>You <em>must</em> change the account name in the plugin configuration to your own, otherwise Adams statues, as great as they are, will appear on your page! Whilst you are there you can choose how many statuses you want to appear on the page.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/config.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="styling">Styling</h2>
<p>There is absolutely no styling applied to the div elements placed on the page. This is to give you the most choice possible for how it looks. In my example screenshot above I have some very simple flexbox styling as shown below.</p>
<pre><code>#omg_statuslog {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 20px;
    font-size: 80%;
}

#omg_statuslog &gt; div:nth-child(1) {
    background: blue;
    border-radius: 11px;
    color: white; 
}

#omg_statuslog &gt; div {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: space-between;
        padding: 10px;
        flex-direction: row;
        flex-wrap: nowrap;
        gap: 20px
}

#omg_statuslog .status_emoji {
    font-size: 50px;
}

#omg_statuslog .status_content {
    flex: 80%;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>
<p>This plugin uses on page javascript so there are a few things to bear in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>it takes a few seconds to fetch the data from the API and display this on the page</li>
<li>if a browser is setup to blog javascript then nothing will appear on the page.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
<p>Thanks to Adam for creating such a great service in omg.lol. The statuslog is just a small part of the service, check it out <a href="https://home.omg.lol">here</a>.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>This plugin allows you to display how many replies your micro.blog posts have - it&rsquo;s a vanity metric, nothing more.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/replies.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="setup">SetUp</h2>
<p>You can install the plugin from <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/161059/find">the plugins page</a>, or feel free to get it from Github by clicking design, edit theme, and then add new plugin.</p>
<p>Call the plugin anything you wish, copy in the URL from <a href="https://github.com/gr36/reply-count">the Github page</a>, and click Add Plugin.</p>
<h3 id="add-partial">Add Partial</h3>
<p>Add the partial to the place you wish this to show, for example this may go in the meta information for the post. This can be used in a single post, or in a loop of posts. Each reply count is place in a unique div element so feel free to experiment.</p>
<p>Simply add <code>{ partial &quot;replycount.html&quot; . }}</code> to your page and the number of replies to that specific post will appear.</p>
<h3 id="styling">Styling</h3>
<p>You can style the block however you like using the class <code>replies</code>. The count number itself sits inside an inline-block class <code>reply_count</code>.</p>
<h2 id="config">Config</h2>
<p>To aid styling you can add in your own emoji to appear before the number, as well as your own text to appear afterwards. If thats not your thing then either options can be toggled on/off in the plugin settings.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>In my work to recreate my 11ty blog on micro.blog I wanted a better search experience for readers, and also myself when searching for posts to link to. Manton did a great job with his <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/plugin-search-page">search page plugin</a>, so I adapted this to be able to appear on any page.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/search-bar.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This plugin for micro.blog will allow you to add a search bar to any page you wish.</p>
<h2 id="set-up">Set Up</h2>
<p>This plugin is available from the <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/122">micro.blog plugin page</a>, or feel free to install it from Github by clicking design, edit theme, and then add new plugin.</p>
<p>Call the plugin anything you wish, copy in the URL from the <a href="https://github.com/gr36/search-partial">Github page</a>, and click Add Plugin.</p>
<h3 id="add-partial">Add Partial</h3>
<p>Add the partial to the page you wish this to show on, for example, I have placed this on my home page but you could do this wherever you like.</p>
<p>Simply add <code>{{ partial “search.html” . }}</code> to your page and the search bar will show as 100% width of the element it is placed in.</p>
<p>When searching, an HTML element will appear and show the results, linking to pages that contain the searched for words.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/search-results.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="customise-search">Customise Search</h3>
<p>You can customise the number of results shown on your page by heading into plugin options and changing the default from 5.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/search-options.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="styling">Styling</h2>
<p>The styling of the search bar will be depend on your theme, I have added in some basic styling as follows.</p>
<pre><code>.field {
        width: 100%;
        height: 34px;
        border: 2px solid #eee;
        padding-left: 10px;
        margin-top: 20px;
        margin-bottom: 20px;
        border-radius: 11px;
    }
    
    #list_results {
        padding: 2rem;
        border-radius: 11px;
        box-shadow: rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3) 0px 1px 2px 0px, rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15) 0px 1px 3px 1px;
    
    }
</code></pre>
<p><code>.field</code> is the search box itself.</p>
<p><code>#list_results</code> is the results box that only shows when search results are found.</p>

<p>The basis of this plugin came from Manton <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/plugin-search-page">search page plugin</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There are <a href="/2022/11/27/ive-replaced-the.html">many things</a> I am taking away from my 30 days no Twitter experiment. The feelings of worry that have all but disappeared are a by product of not being plugged into the attention economy, but I’m still not convinced I am getting the best possible results. My attachment to Mastodon has meant that I am still consuming the internet in bite sized chunks and far too often.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that my new favourite place to hang out is a really nice place to be. Due to the platform not being invested in maximising my time on site, users do not have the worst of the platform shoved in their face. The content is not really an issue, but the snack sized updates feel like I have not moved on. I have theorised that perhaps the constant scroll has associated itself in my brain with a worry state. The sheer fact that I am consuming the internet in the same shallow moving state is also causing me issues.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5e0b259edf.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>At the end of the day, any social network site is a distraction. Granted, sometimes I need those, but more often than not I don’t. Mastodon is great, but ultimately suffers from the same issues as Twitter due to the humans using it. Consuming the internet in a giant feed of updates will eventually fall into the same traps, and I’m not convinced it&rsquo;s good for my brain. It doesn’t matter where those updates are, or <a href="/2022/11/30/shortcut-find-mastodon.html">where I follow along</a> with them, it will still be a tool for my monkey brain to get its fix.</p>
<p>As nice as the place is, I don’t feel like Mastodon is anything more than a replacement. <a href="/2022/11/22/learn-your-lesson.html">Now is the perfect time</a> to consider if the internet should be followed a bit deeper instead through blogs and news sites. Writing more. Sharing and interacting with a bit more care and attention than fleeting updates.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter the words used. A status update is a Toot, is a Tweet, and perhaps I’ve just had enough of all of them? Currently I feel like I’ve escaped an abusive relationship, but I’m hanging around with their slightly nicer identical twin. Sure it’s better, but it’s a bit too familiar.</p>

      <p>I still can’t decide where I want to <a href="https://social.lol/@gr36/109391559674985682">put my time</a>. Do I follow mastodon users on Micro.blog or follow micro.blog users on Mastodon? At the minute I’m doing both, and thankfully it’s straightforward to find <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/activitypub/95">any ActivityPub users</a> on Micro.blog. Even easier with the handy Shortcut!</p>
<div class="full">
<img src="uploads/2024/632f98a9ac.jpg">
</div>
Grab it [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7b13dc07c9004fde9c2988fc4f1ebcc2)
<p>All you have to do is find the user&rsquo;s account and run the Shortcut. You need to highlight the user&rsquo;s account address in Safari and share the webpage to the Shortcut. This is especially handy for people with a complicated instance address. If this isn’t possible, just type (or paste) in the handle when asked.</p>
<p>The Shortcut will then convert the address to the correct format and search micro.blog. From there you can follow the account easily, just make sure you’re signed in. All of your accounts in one place, like magic. That’s interoperability for you!</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The cost of living crisis in the UK has been getting progressively worse for the last few months and is destined to continue that way. Price increases to gas and electric, coupled with corporate greed, has seen food costs rocket upwards with dramatic effect.</p>
<p>I am thankful to not be in a financial position where this will kill me, but the constant worry about money is really starting to take its toll. Food expenses we have cut down on tremendously and started to really budget and plan everything, but heating and electric is becoming a nightmare.</p>
<p>I mean, listen to me with my first world problems, but I’m starting to think that the UK perhaps isn’t as first world as we think. Always having to think about turning things off, and playing the balancing act with heating is really stressful. Constantly considering keeping people at a temperature that they will be OK, but not too warm, where we are wasting money. We shouldn’t be living like this in a developed country.</p>
<p>The threat of falling into debt or not being able to keep my family warm is stressing me out, and the worry of prices going up again after April makes it even worse. Perhaps we’ll just sell up and move somewhere warm.</p>

      <p>I needed some time out this afternoon, so went for a walk in the woods with my trusty x100v. I’ve never been one for woodland photography, but love a nice walk in nature. I tried to take a range of photos as the colours are still hanging on from autumn, but judging by the images that actually came out, you would think I had been mushroom hunting.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Despite all the words, the thoughts and the conscious decision to try not to. My monthly challenge of no Twitter for 30 days has not gone as well as it should have. I was hoping to really bring myself around to the idea that I don’t need to be online as much as I am, but instead I’ve just replaced my Twitter scrolling with Mastodon scrolling.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this is much better for me. There’s no need for me to worry about being led down rabbit holes, or toxic tweets being shoved in my face. Mastodon has no motivation to maximise the time I spend engaged, but it’s still worse than nothing.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2b6a7b707c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The good news is that I feel much better for not being on Twitter. Despite all the tech news coverage and seemingly everyone talking about it, I have zero motivation to go back to Twitter. The reason for this is pretty easy for me to recognise because a large percentage of people I follow have <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/elon-musk-and-the-worst-people/">checked out of Twitter too</a>. Helping to curb my feelings of missing out or not being included in conversations.</p>
<p>When I say I have not been on the website, I truly haven’t and that’s the first time in a long while. When I’ve had similar time away, I’ve always checked in a little. Scrolled thought friends profiles without being logged in or had a <a href="/2021/07/09/a-quick-check.html">look to see what’s happening</a>. What I have done though is replaced my <a href="/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html">Twitter muscle memory</a> with Mastodon. Reaching for boredom relief is still built into my subconscious instead of just embracing the boredom.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a step in the right direction though. Despite not really <a href="/2022/11/25/this-may-just.html">seeing the point in sharing</a> so much any more, Mastodon has given me the fix I needed to pull myself away from doom scrolling Twitter. I need to give a massive thank you to the billionaire baby for finally ruining Twitter to a point I don’t care any more. Cheers!</p>

      <p>Given the resent issues with the bird site, it’s been great to see so many people delete their accounts to move away. Voting with your attention is the best way to use the power at your disposal. Of course, you can use whatever site it is that you want to use, but many of the users I am seeing are just moving from one bad silo to another. Perhaps naively, I thought people would have learnt by now to demand more from their social network.</p>
<p>You don’t need to know the ins and out of indie websites and decentralisation to know that any private company that controls your attention is going to do the same things. They all have layers of staff to pay, infrastructure to keep running and as such need to show you as many ads as they possibly can, or charge you money to use it.</p>
<p>So, with disappointment, I see users making the same mistakes that photographers did when Instagram went down hill. Jumping from one silo into another one, that will <em>always</em> end up going the same way. Manipulating the users to maximise time on site is inevitable. Thankfully, this is the perfect opportunity to really think about your social media usage and come to terms with the fact that nothing good can ever come from the attention economy.</p>
<p>With that said, use whatever you want to use and if something brings you happiness, then go for it! However, investing your time into a place, wherever that may be, that has your best interests at heart should be a focus. Not jumping to the new hotness. For many people, there will not be a new place, and perhaps that is the best thing for society. Although I am enjoying using some alternatives such as Mastodon, I am thinking long and hard about my usage and don’t want to swop one bad habit for another one.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When I first stated writing online, I didn’t even know what a blog was. I set up some online hosting, and cobbled together an HTML website from a theme, and then when I posted something I would duplicate a page and link it up on the man index, all manually. No research done, no WordPress, I had no clue. All I knew was that I wanted to publish online and be a writer, and it wasn’t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610095709/http://gr36.com/">until 2013</a> that I really sorted myself out and began to publish properly.</p>
<p>Due to this desire, I wrote about my thoughts about technology on my blog and then posted the links to Facebook and Twitter. I am so glad that I went this way and have almost all of my posts as a record instead of pouring all of my time into social media. Although I have no idea what started this motivation, the last few weeks have proven that more and more people should be doing the same and <a href="/2021/03/22/the-value-of.html">putting some value</a> into the things they put on the internet.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/daa551975c.jpg" alt="My first WordPress Blog From June 2013"></p>
<p>In this time of turmoil and possible migration, don’t just fall into the same trap and do the same with Mastodon, or wherever you end up. There are some great services out there now that can provide you with a <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/pricing/19">cost-effective</a> way to turn your would be <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/4480-2/">tweet storms into blog posts</a> to make them yours, forever. I am a little bias towards micro.blog because, although not perfect, it offers you a great way to get started and start posting everything to one place.</p>
<p>My true hope with all this Twitter nonsense is that people start moving away from social media apart from for real communication, and that more thangs get published online. Blogging isn’t about putting 300+ words together in a nice little package and choosing the right images to go along with it. It can be anything you want it to be, your blog and your posts are your own and don’t need to conform to anyone else’s rules.</p>
<p>You will hear many blog supporters discuss ownership, the indieweb and even internet standards when getting preachy about having a blog. None of these really matter to most people, the real reason you need a blog is to showcase you. To have your little place online that isn’t affected by algorithms and billionaire babies. It’s just yours.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It’s rare that a trailer sparks any reaction in me. I often feel like I have watched the whole film, don’t you think they are too long nowadays and ruin it? Anyway, I saw one for the <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81387962">Netflix film Shutz</a> by Jonah Hill yesterday, and it sparked plenty of feelings. Something that I have been trying to work on myself over the last few months, and that’s just STFU and listening to people.</p>
<p>Pretty near the start, he says something that has echoed around my brain all day. “They just listen [therapists], and all your friends, who are idiots, give you advice. And you want your friends just to listen”. I’ve written before about me struggling to make many real life friends. The ones I have, I never unload my feelings onto them because I do not want them having to listen to my issues, but I have always been a good sounding board for them. People talk to me frequently about their issues, and I try to give the best advice I can.</p>
<p>I struggle with talking too much. I’m like a toddler, when I hear something that I have thoughts about I want to share them straight away. I do have a filter between brain and mouth, but it might be a little on the short side. Should I in fact, just shut up and listen more instead of giving out my advice. Typically, I have no experience of the situation they are experiencing and as such I am, as Jonah says, an idiot.</p>
<p>Flipping this on its head, I think I would talk to more people around me if they just listened. I don’t share my feeling with others, apart from on my blog, because I don’t need the advice, I just need to say my feelings out load. Much like my process for writing, talking though things often lets me come to a resolution on my own. I’d love to be listened to more. I’ve started watching the full film this morning and already written down loads of notes to refer to, so I might get more advice than I bargained for out of this.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I distinctly remember watching this year&rsquo;s Apple event and being interested in absolutely nothing new. The yearly even that temps me into spending massive sums of money didn’t come across as well as usual. Most of the improvements were software anyway. Despite my bank balance thanking me, I felt a bit flat that I wouldn’t be picking up my usually iPhone and Apple Watch combination ready for my birthday in a couple of weeks time.</p>
<p>How wrong could I have been. Just a couple of months later, I am sat typing this out with an iPhone 14 Pro in my pocket and the most surprising hit of the year, an Apple Watch Ultra on my wrist. Whilst I like the iPhone, I would give it up with very little thought if I had too, however no one is taking this watch away from me now, and that shouldn’t be the case.</p>
<p>All of the Apple marketing tells me this watch is not for people like me. Sure I am relatively fit, despite health issues stopping me from running much, and I do like the outdoors. This watch is supposed to be for those that are levels above me. Divers, rock climbers, ultra distance runners, it’s not supposed to be for full-time dads and office workers, but here we are. All the improvements are just as useful in everyday life as they are for those Apple aim it at, and I adore it.</p>
<p>That’s it, review over. There are enough people out there that will walk you through specs and all the things that it can do, unfortunately I lack the ability to express the boring bits well and answer those types of questions you may have. What I can do though is tell you why and how this helps me in my daily life and hopefully help you see where it <em>could</em> be useful to you. This is pretty easy because there are not many areas that make a difference, but they add up to something that most people should consider.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/08bec90030.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="battery-life">Battery Life</h2>
<p>Presentations and marketing never give a true reflection of the type of usage you will get from Apple devices. They are pretty spot on, but no-one does the things they highlight. They don’t watch video playback on a MacBook Pro for 18 hours straight, and most people won’t be doing <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-watch-ultra/">60 hours worth of exercise</a> (low-power mode required). It’s even hard to work out what battery life would actually be like when comparing to the ‘regular’ Apple Watches “all day” but the Ultra will easily see you through three days.</p>
<p>I loose around 25% per 24 hours, including sleep tracking and at least one workout. Although occasionally, it seems to plummet at twice that rate until I reboot, which is bound to be something software related. Is this the best battery life on the market, no. Is this anything compared to a Garmin watch for example, no again. It is the best Battery life in an Apple Watch to date, and this means less to worry about.</p>
<p>The only ‘downside’ is that charging takes quite a while. Using a supported fast charger, it can get you from 25% ish up to 50+ in 30 mins, but it takes a while to top it up to full. I have mediated this by charging it most days for 30 minutes or so while I have a shower and get sorted for the day. This sees the battery life hover around 80-50% constantly and suits me much better than having to charge it for 90-minutes or so every few days.</p>
<p>I am over the moon with the improvements to battery life of the Apple Watch Ultra. I wear it constantly, use if for <a href="/2022/10/30/so-ive-finally.html">phone free days out</a>, and in my testing when I was trying to see how far it would get me I only lost 12% after 5 hours of hard use. If you&rsquo;re like me and want to be contactable, still be able to make payments and other modern things, but <a href="/2022/02/10/the-ultimate-minimalist.html">don’t want a phone around all the time</a>, the Apple Watch Ultra is the perfect device.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/22abfc4284.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="size--design">Size &amp; Design</h2>
<p>When I first thought about getting the Apple Watch Ultra was when people I knew began to receive them and use them. Sure, I’d seen the glossy images in press reviews and seen a few in video reviews, but once they were all over social media my opinions changed. The design that I thought was chunky and horrible, actually looked much better ‘in-person’. When compared to larger Casio watches the Apple Watch Ultra looks much nicer, to me at least.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all subjective. You may look at the raised lip to the flat screen, coupled with the crown guard, and think yuck. Some of my desire was just motivation to have something else, anything else, than the Apple Watch I had been wearing for years, but the Ultra version looks really impressive and feels great on my wrist. Even my tiny wrists. Seriously, I have to buy Size 6 braided loops and a S/M in the Orange Alpine Strap as seen in almost all press shots (it is nice though).</p>
<p>The great thing about the new design is that it doesn’t scream smartwatch. It’s obvious that it is one if you’re paying attention, but from everyday life, to the boardroom, the design looks more like a watch than the original design. The chunky design is not for everyone, and in fact more stylish watch brands are going the offsite way and slimming down, but it looks much better than the press photos would have you believe.</p>
<h3 id="comfortable">Comfortable</h3>
<p>The weird thing about this watch is, despite the increase in size, and it is a big watch, it&rsquo;s far more comfortable than other versions. The heart rate sensor doesn’t seem to push itself into my wrist as much, and the increased width makes the straps pull around my wrist rather than down. With the increased battery life, I tried sleeping in it, which I rarely did with the old one, and was surprised how comfortable it is.</p>
<p>Watch straps are a bit looser when compared with the regular ones, which makes perfect sense given that the watch itself is slightly bigger. This is only obvious with fixed length bands like my favourite braided loops.</p>
<h3 id="rough--ready">Rough &amp; Ready</h3>
<p>I have lost count the number of times I have accidentally scraped my watch on a wall, or knocked it on a door frame. Accidents happen in real life and although my sport versions always stood up OK, they always end their time with me with more than a few scrapes and chips. This new titanium version with the robust design gives me the confidence that I don’t have to worry about it. This is one of the great appeals of this watch, yes it can stand up to mountain climbing or whatever, but it will also resist being hit by a ‘ toy or fumbling it off its charger in the dark. It’s outdoor proof and also life proof.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/66b94c8d07.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="useable">Useable</h3>
<p>Many of the design changes are due to fitting in a much larger screen. I suppose 49 mm is not that much of a difference from 45, but that’s almost a 10% bump up. The new watchOS 9 exaggerates this further because the OS feels much larger than before, making interaction with the screen much easier. From swiping on the keyboard replying to a message to opening and using a app, it really is surprising what a difference a few mm make on a watch screen.</p>
<p>The screen is also much brighter when in use. This isn’t something that I noticed when using older versions, only when testing both side by side you do notice the stark difference. Making the screen much easier to see and use, especially when working out, when a quick glance is all you need to see all information on the nice big screen.</p>
<p>The screen is not the only thing that’s been improved, sure you’ll also get more accurate GPS and a depth sensor, but a massive improvement is the onboard speaker. Making it even more useful in daily life if, like me, you get phone calls at the worst possible time. I’m not saying people on the other end can’t tell they are on speaker, but you can hear them load and clear now whatever you are doing. When phone free, I’ve been making and receiving quite a few calls and the speaker makes a nice change to having to carry around my AirPods just in case.</p>
<h2 id="i-love-it">I Love It</h2>
<p>All of these things make the Apple Watch Ultra one of the best buys of the last few years. The battery life and small improvements all around have made me think less about it being a smartwatch, and more of a life assistant. I have the confidence it will do whatever I need it to do, whenever I need it. I can go phone free for hours on end as well as stand up to all the stresses and strains of my hectic lifestyle. It comes with me everywhere and I absolute love it.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that everyone should rush out and buy it. This is a £850 watch, after all. It won’t retain the value like spending the same money on a regular watch would do, and it won’t last nearly as long. However, it can aid your life in some very specific ways that I think plenty of people would enjoy. If you have the opportunity, try one out and see what it can do for you.</p>

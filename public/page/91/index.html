      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Filipe Espósito <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/04/09/ios-14-apple-developing-clips-feature-for-using-apps-without-requiring-full-downloads/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s say you get a QR Code with a link to a video from YouTube but you don’t have the official app installed on your iPhone. With iOS 14 and the Clip API, you’ll be able to scan that code and the video will be reproduced on a floating card that shows a native user interface instead of a web page.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Developers will need to specify which part of the app should be downloaded by iOS as an Over-The-Air package to read that content. The floating card will show options to download the full version of the app from the App Store or to open that content with the app if it’s already installed.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the article mentions this is very similar to <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/slices">Slices</a> that Google announced in 2018. Again proving that quite often Google have the right idea but seem to lack the control or the motivation to gain enough traction.</p>
<p>I am not sure how many apps adopt things from Android when announced, but the iOS eco-system seems to be ready to go as soon as the public update happens. iOS14 is shaping up to be a big update.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>For years of my life, I have never strayed away from the mouse supplied with my computer. That usually meant horrible PC vendors attempts and more recently an Apple Magic mouse or trackpad. There isn’t much magic about these mice, and it’s only when you use one all day every day that you realise just how uncomfortable it is. Sure you can use gestures, but it’s just far too flat and unergonomic.</p>
<p>With this, my journey into finding a suitable mouse lead me down far too many YouTube rabbit holes – but I landed on the <a href="https://amzn.to/2QWvjgF">Logitech MX Master 3.</a>  As you may already be able to tell this is the third iteration of Logitechs well thought after MX Master range. This new version is an iteration on the first few but offers a few tweaks and changes that make it a worthy upgrade and the best version to date.</p>
<h2>Ergonomics</h2>
<p>I don’t think I am alone in thinking that the most important thing from a mouse is comfort. It can have as many buttons and gestures on it as you like, but if it’s shaped weird or just wrong for your working position, then you’re going to struggle. The high curves and comfortable rounded edges of this mouse make it one of the most comfortable I have had the pleasure of using – as long as you’re right-handed of course. The MX Master 3 fits perfectly into my hand, and also anyone else that has laid ether hands on it.</p>
<p>There is something weird about other people using this mouse because it feels so personal to you. The customisation options and buttons feel part of you and the way you work. It’s full click things, glowing things and more scrolling stuff than you can shake a stick at. When you think you’ve found them all, Logitech throws a few more in there hidden under the thumb rest or underneath your palm.</p>
<p>What they didn’t include was a place to store the accompanying dongle, but I’m not sure if you need this with modern laptops and tablets. Mine is still sitting in the box after using it once. However, this mouse offers a vast range of connectivity to Mac, PC and iOS.</p>
<p>If you’re stuck, it works over USB and not only that you can charge it and use it at the same time! What a revelation. Battery life is ridiculous for the charging time it needs. Plug it into a USB cable and leave it an hour and you’ll be good to go for a reported 70 hours. In fact, in the two months, I have been using it I have charged it twice and been using it upwards of 6 hours a day.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="MBLTTE-1-1-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/771fe11e9e.jpg" alt="MBLTTE 1 1 1" width="599" height="337" border="0" /></p>
<p>The great thing third party mice usually allow you to do is to have multiple devices set up at once. The MX Master 3 is no different, allowing you to switch between 3 different options at the touch of a button. Meaning you can switch to using a different computer or as I have seamlessly switch between macOS and iOS with the touch of a button. If you know the pain of having to unpair and repair that Apple requires, you’ll understand why this is a massive deal. When using the MX Master 3 with iOS and the new 13.4 update it works very well indeed. However you miss out on all of the customisations and some of the gestures — so this isn’t all good news.</p>
<p>The multi-paring options are for those that may use a different machine at home and work, or perhaps switch between a desktop and laptop, which is where maybe the black magic function of the MX Master 3 comes to light. <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/options/page/flow-multi-device-control">Logitech Flow</a> introduces another level above universal copy and paste. Only by having your devices on the same wi-fi network, you can seamlessly copy and paste files from one machine to another, even across operating systems.</p>
<h2>Logi-Options: Loads Of Them</h2>
<p>What is most surprising is that they manage to do this with minimal setup and a lot less hassle than I expected. You will need to grant Logi-options, the supporting software, some permission when installing. Still, in exchange, you get the ability to customise every single button and scroll wheel on the device to your liking. It doesn’t just stop at tracking or double click speed like some pointers. There are what seems like limitless options to customise all interaction and even change this depending on what application you are using. Especially great for those with very particular workflows or interaction needs.</p>
<p>Logitech provides a few default profiles and will offer to install these for you so you can see what other people use for each app. However, it takes very little time to build up a robust handful of shortcuts for your most-used functions. For example, I have set the forward button to act as a shortcut back to Selection (V) in Illustrator and the back button as the pen tool (P) — these are my most used tools, and I switch back and forth all the time. This may seem pointless because these are straight forward keyboard shortcuts, but I can worry about other things instead of reaching out for my keyboard.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-04-01-at-13.22.56-1-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d0d7896d6f.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 04 01 at 13 22 56 1 1" width="599" height="416" border="0" /></p>
<p>I was soon saving loads of time adopting shortcuts into my workflow and scrolling around with ease in almost every application I have. The MX Master 3 features both a horizontal and vertical scroll wheel for the ultimate ability to move around a canvas or scroll through your timeline. The most interesting of which is the vertical one, which now uses magnets to minimise noise and remove wear and tear. It still retains the easy switching between tense and free-scrolling that other versions have – the downside of which means I leave it spinning for way longer than I should. What can I say it’s my <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1247867314822938627?s=20">desk fidget spinner</a>.</p>
<p>One of the best buttons to master (excuse the pun) on this mouse is the gesture button. By using the button under your thumb, it allows you to have five different shortcuts built-in. Press to open mission control, hold and move backwards for expose, or side to side to switch between apps. If you don’t currently use gestures on your Magic Mouse or Trackpad, the <a href="https://amzn.to/2RlMkAW">MX Master 3</a> will persuade you to start using multiple desktops and master expose for good.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="MBLTTE-4-1-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/20487e647f.jpg" alt="MBLTTE 4 1 1" width="599" height="337" border="0" /></p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>All these words above boil down to one thing. This is the best mouse you can buy for productivity. It’s going to cost a little more, but it’s going to speed up your workflow no end. The <a href="https://amzn.to/2RlMkAW">MX Master 3</a> is overkill if you don’t spend a lot of time at your desk, but it’s the real deal for everyone else. One of the few things I haven’t suffered any buyer remorse over for a long time and I don’t see myself going back to uncomfortable Apple mice ever again.</p>

For all of its failings and flops, all of its breeches and blunders, the internet has become the digital town square that we always believed it could and should be. At a time when politicians and many corporations have exhibited the worst instincts, we’re seeing some of the best of what humanity has to offer — and we’re seeing it because the internet exists.</p></blockquote>
<p>It gets a bad rep does the world wide web.</p>
<p>Full of horrors, and screens and things your kids really shouldn’t be doing – but image trying to go through a lockdown without it.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be able to work from home, I wouldn’t be nearly as entertained and I wouldn’t be able to see anyone. I district myself with far too much internet at times – but thank god (or whoever) it exists.</p>

<blockquote><p>You’d probably be able to read about all these changes in a revived news media. The past decade has been devastating for journalism, with waves of job losses year after year. The rise of behavioural advertising isn’t the sole culprit, but it’s a big one. Newspaper ad revenue, steadily climbing until 2006, has plunged ever since. Where have advertisers taken their budgets instead? Overwhelmingly, to Facebook and Google and the advertising infrastructure they control. Take away their targeting advantage, and marketers would have to shift back to paying publications to reach their audiences, so-called “contextual advertising.” Getting rid of micro-targeting wouldn’t singlehandedly restore journalism to its glory days, but it could help—a lot.</p></blockquote>
<p>Online advertising is responsible for so many negative things you would think that banning it would be a no brainer. The big issue is it still makes s many companies a shed load of money it would be almost impossible to stop.</p>
<p>As much as online website can monetise themselves by showing adverts, it means that this is the sole metric they need. Articles exist simply to get views and attention – giving birth to more fake news and more clickbait rubbish.</p>

<div>
<p>Just before the country went into lockdown, I got a preview of 13.4 with proper mouse support. I tested this out with my <a href="https://gr36.com/the-ipad-goes-full-circle/">entry-level iPad</a> not expecting much and was blown away. I immediately went out and bought another 12.9″ iPad Pro.</p>
<p>I can’t overstate this. The newly designed interface is a delight to use and goes some of the ways to understanding why Apple took so bringing this in. The easy way would have been to have the same old arrow – but instead, we got something that fits iOS perfectly, a finger-like curser that morphed into whatever it is you’re trying to select.</p>
<blockquote><p>Move the pointer above a button and the circle morphs into the button itself, “snapping” into it, enveloping it like an amoeba, causing it to glow in a pleasing way. What this means is the usual precision of a trackpad isn’t required to get exact hits on navigational elements. – Craig Mod for <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ipad-trackpad-cursor/">Wired</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Why does this make such a difference you ask. Well – decides the software bugs and the annoying interface, one of the biggest things that stopped me using my iPad was its limitedness. Such I can use it as an iPad and somewhat as a computer when I’m travelling. It just didn’t have the flexibility to use it as a computer if needed. As I am spending more and more time at a. Desk, I can not pair a keyboard and mouse and use it was a desktop, combine it with the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MXQU2B/A/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-129%E2%80%91inch-4th-generation-british-english">magic keyboard and use as a laptop</a>, and strip it down to read on a tablet.</p>
<p>The iPad kind of sort of did this before, but nowhere near as good as it does now – Bravo Apple.</p>

<p>Being one of the lucky ones, I can continue to complete my work from home and exchange my work for money in the never-ending cycle of capitalism. I have already written about my <a href="https://gr36.com/regular-9-5/">destain for a regular 9-5 job</a>. I have kids to sort out, meeting to attend and just stuff to do in the day. We all have, and this has been highlighted more than ever during this time we are confined to homes.</p>
<p>I have been doing this on and off for a few months, but it’s still hard for me to do it regularly and consistently. At the moment I am working from 7-1ish and then again from 5-8ish, and this allows me time to share the care with my daughter. I don’t very often time sensitive things to do, so I am fortunate that flexibility suits me.</p>
<p>What I am hoping from this forced isolation period is that more companies start to open their minds to remote work. There is a wealth of things that can be achieved by adopting it, and working remotely should become what we all move towards. This isn’t going to work for everyone, but can work for some many people</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is, there are a thousand ways to do remote work, but it starts with committing to it at all levels of the company. If you assume positive intent and place trust in your coworkers and employees—knowing that if they do great work in an office, they can do great work anywhere—then you will all succeed. – <a href="http://ma.tt/">Ma.tt</a></p></blockquote>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Around this time last year, I was urging readers to think about where they are placing their technology investment seriously. It was a call to try and force people to think more in-depth than a shiny new thing. Think about where the product is coming from and what the money you are exchanging will fund. We all need to take extra time when considering funding brands like Google, Facebook and many others.</p>
<p>However, in recent weeks it has become apparent the difference in company ethics then the chips are down. The way they treat their staff and prioritise things when faced with the unprecedented times speaks volumes about the company as a whole – and it’s essential that from now on you vote strongly with your wallet.</p>
<p>In the UK, High Street and online brands have shown their true colours and prioritised profits instead of staff health. Companies such as <a href="https://gr36.com/where-to-put-your-tech-investment/">Sports Direct</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/jd-wetherspoon-refuses-pay-suppliers-until-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-ends">Wetherspoons</a> and <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/virgin-media-staff-at-danger-coronavirus-a4400996.html">Virgin Media</a> have come under massive criticism for the way they are handling government instructions and the health of their staff. Understandably, a business wants to continue as much as possible, but many have simply not listened to instruction and prioritised profits over the health of their staff. Or in the case of Wetherspoons, used Government funding as an excuse to screw over their team.</p>
<p>If you want to buy into the stories or not, that’s up to you – but at least listen to what’s going on and choose more wisely.</p>
<p>It’s understandable for companies not to be prepared for something like this, but it’s not acceptable for them to carry on as usual and cram warehouse workers in as standard. Some companies are no strangers to risking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions">workers health to profits</a>, but endangerment like <a href="https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/b/500-workers-walk-out-of-asos-factory-after-company-fails-to-enforce-social-distancing">some we have seen</a> is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Do not wait for government intervention, because it will never come. Do not threaten action online, because most of the time, it can’t live up to the promise. Just simply think about where you are buying things from and placing your investment. Would you want to be treated the way we have seen in recent weeks? If the answer is not, do not fund the company to carry on doing so. You re the only thing that matters, and where you spend your money is more important than ever.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Many people are already using an iPad as their desktop ‘computer’, and with the launch of the new magic keyboard, this may rise further. The new magic keyboard for iPad Pro has a USB-C passthrough for power and as such will mean your iPad could be left on charge all the time while on your desk – is this safe to do? That’s a hard question to ask, but hopefully, I found an answer.</p>
<p>This question isn’t a new one, and it’s one that everyone has an opinion on. Much as everyone complaining in a shop has a friend that works for trading standards; everyone becomes a physicist when talking about charging your battery. Leading to much hearsay and loads of conflicting information.</p>
<p>The straight to the point answer is that battery technology has drastically improved since people started charging their mobiles every night. Back then, there were all sorts of scare stories about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/dec/05/blackberry-investigate-exploding-phone">exploding Blackberry’s</a> and only charging your phone <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/features/92897/charging-your-phone-overnight-battery-myths-debunked">from below 10%</a>. The myths are vast and frankly downright weird at times, but it’s safe to say that there is loads of technology built into the battery of your iPad to protect it.</p>
<p>Since 2012, Apple has made <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-ipad-charging-fine-keep-it-plugged-in/">charging much more complex</a> and made loads of improvements aimed at maximising your battery life. This is universal across the range of devices, so what’s suitable for one is ideal for another. Battery university (yes that’s a real thing) has a vast array of information on Lithium-based Batteries, and are often quoted as a good source for information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In theory, such a mechanism should work forever, but cycling, elevated temperature and ageing decrease the performance over time. –</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries">Battery University</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They conclude after much research and loads of graphs that the user can do a few things to prolong the longevity of their battery. Highlighting that “The worst situation is keeping a fully charged battery at elevated temperatures” – so avoiding high temperatures should be a significant indicator towards maximising life.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cd16cccb76.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 11" /></figure>
<p>The number of cycles that you iPad will go though does add to the wear on your battery, but there is no clear answer to what a cycle is. A more important factor is elevated temperatures. So in theory, keep your battery charged and away from heat and you should be ok. Apple says <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/">between 0 and 35 degrees C</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evaluating battery life on counting cycles is not conclusive because a discharge may vary in-depth and there are no clearly defined standards of what constitutes a cycle –</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries">Battery University</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second piece of information you hear is the level of battery charge you should be completing. A considerable wealth of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/85fqkz/is_it_a_good_idea_to_keep_my_ipad_pro_plugged_in/">forum posts</a> and opinions display numbers that seem plucked from thin air. However, research does suggest that a battery should not be charged to 100%. Ever. The good news is that your battery never reaches that far, 100% in the software is not 100% battery capacity – so there is no need to worry.</p>
<p>Since iOS13 Apple has been working on machine learning your habits and maximising battery life. Once the OS displays your iPad is at 100%, it will <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210512">intelligently</a> discharge and recharge the battery very gradually. Apple has also intelligently accounted for issues that seem to arise after 80% capacity. Once your iPad is charged to above 80%, the charging rate is dramatically reduced. So think of the last 20% as what’s generally referred to as a trickle charge.</p>

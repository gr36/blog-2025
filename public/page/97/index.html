<p>There are thousands of posts just like this all over the internet. Posting knowledge for others to consume as if they are some wise old prophet with a WordPress blog. Having read a few, there were some golden nuggets extracted, and I began to think about what I would tell myself if I could travel back in time.</p>
<h2><b>Don’t think you know everything</b></h2>
<p>This is one of the worst attitudes to take, and unfortunately, it seems a natural one. When you leave school all spirited and confident, indeed the world is your oyster, and you can do whatever you like. What you cant do is take it for granted, you don’t know everything, spend your time learning and growing.</p>
<h2><b>You are your own person</b></h2>
<p>Stand on your own two feet, other people might make you what you are, but they don’t live in your head. Be yourself and don’t be afraid to be that person at all times. Other people are not responsible for what you do or how happy you are.</p>
<h2><b>Hold your hands up often</b></h2>
<p>You will screw up; you will make mistakes – so when you do don’t be afraid to own up to them and take responsibility. Just because you made a mistake doesn’t mean you did it purposely and it certainly doesn’t make you stupid.</p>
<h2><b>Don’t cling to bad ideas</b></h2>
<p>You might have thought it was the right choice at the time, so to join your new love for owning up to your mistakes, don’t cling to decisions that didn’t work out. You might have chosen the way to go on wrong information, or things might have changed – doesn’t matter the reason, give it up.</p>
<h2><b>Get rid of half your friends</b></h2>
<p>Leave friendships that don’t bring you joy or expose you to negativity as quickly as you would a job or a partner. Don’t tolerate people just because you think you have to. All those people that you knew at school, if they are still around in 2 years, then they might be worth bothering with.</p>
<h2><b>No, you don’t love them</b></h2>
<p>Love isn’t what you think it is, stop using it out of context. You will know it soon enough.</p>
<h2><b>There are plenty of hours in the day</b></h2>
<p>Plan things, take advantage of everything available to you and don’t slack off. Your whole life will fly past in what seems like no time, but you have plenty of time to get things done.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On June 3rd 2019 and with a little trepidation, I pushed the upgrade button Apple flashed before my eyes. I’d stayed up late to install the first beta of iOS13 and already knew I would regret it in some way. During the next couple of months, I would run into a whole host of bugs and crashes – but that was ok because I knew what I was doing and still wanted to use the update before it came out.</p>
<p>On stage Apple demoed the hotly anticipated Reminders upgrade, featuring lots of new features and a fresh new design. To do this, Apple had to ‘Upgrade’ my tasks for them to work, and I have to do the same on my other devices if I wanted them to work correctly. This was all displayed in front of me; I knew what I was doing.</p>
<p>So I dealt with Reminders not syncing to my Mac – I wasn’t planning to update my iMac as I rely on it for my livelihood – and I continued on my merry way. For the most part, iOS13 was stable enough for me to use and file the odd Radar. However now iOS13 has been released to the public, there are a massive amount of people that currently can’t access their reminder on Mac – with no way to ‘upgrade’ as Apple informed them they had to do.</p>
<p>We are now almost two weeks from iOS13 launching; we’ve already seen an update to 13.1, 13.1.1 and only yesterday 13.1.2. Still no sign of the Mac OS update, and no definite date of when it will come. So when Apple places a card in front of you saying you will need to upgrade your devices, what it also doesn’t say is there IS NO update for your mac.</p>
<p>The only hint of what is going on is a small section on <a href="http://apple.com/">Apple.com</a> when discussing iOS13 updates. Something that the vast amount of users are not going to see. I am sure the intention was to release the Catalina update alongside iOS13, but I am pretty sure Apple knew a long time ago that wasn’t going to be possible.</p>
<p>I knew what I was doing – most others did not. It’s on Apple to explain these things better. They let potentially millions of users upgrade their reminders with a half warning. I need reminders to work, don’t rush macOS out for me, but it’d be nice to get it pretty soon.</p>

<p>Craig Grannell <a href="http://reverttosaved.com/2019/09/27/apples-abysmal-mail-toolbar-in-ios-13/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A major differentiator since Apple’s earliest days has been interface design. Apple has long prided itself not only on creating more beautiful interfaces, but also much more usable ones. The aim has always been to make things more obvious, and also more efficient. So what happened in Mail for iOS 13?</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a whole lot of weirdness in iOS13 and this is one of the strangest decisions in UI I have seen for a long time. When people that are reasonably proficient in using technology are convinced there is no way to forward an email you have a problem.</p>
<p>The button its self is not an issue, but the icon used is a lesson in hoe not to design an interface. It clearly implies reply and no further indication that another level of interaction exist beyond it.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Perhaps it’s the lack of characters, perhaps it’s just how Twitter is, but more than ever I am finding Twitter full of opinions that are pushed on everyone else. People are taking themselves to seriously and are expressing themselves aggressively and I’m not sure if I can continue to read it.</p>
<p>I find Twitter quite meditative when done in the right way. Simply sit down a couple of times a day and just absorb the information. If there are other opinions expressed I might check out the full thread, however more often that not I just appreciate their point of view and scroll on by.</p>
<p>I don’t feel I can do this any more, I keep getting pulled into disagreements and I get huge amounts of negativity towards my tweets that after a while gets on top of me. Twitter isn’t discussion any more, it’s arguing and I don’t think I can bring it into my life. I think I’d rather have no interaction than be constantly tweeted at that their opinion matters more.</p>
<p>Mix in passive aggressive sub tweets and I think I’m pretty much at the point of no return. It’s hard enough to find some calm between all the attention seeking, and people building ‘their brand’. Twitter used to be such a great place to hang out. I think it still is but there is a way of expressing push back to people online, as there is in life, but the way Twitter seems to mould it needs to change.</p>
<p>I’m definitely not soft or a snowflake, or any other names people band about when others don’t like what they say. I’m 100% a proponent that people can have whatever opinion they choose, but they need to be expressed in the right way. I say this because I don’t think it is the way people are, just the way that it is encouraged on platforms such as Twitter.</p>

<blockquote><p>If I take on a new idea or habit, I do so because it has the potential to benefit my life. New ideas shape the future Me. Same goes for habits. Over time my ideas change, improve, and expand, and my current habits get replaced by new ones that continue to help me grow. Our readiness to jilt ideas or habits means we’re willing to grow—we’re willing to constantly pursue a better version of ourselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is exactly my feelings towards working on new projects and brining new things into my life too easily. Far too many times now I have gone too deep into things without enough thought and burnt myself out trying. Minimalism isn’t just about having less stuff, its about being intentional with everything you do.</p>

<p>It’s hard for me to write about the differences between Android and iOS, and I struggle to comprehend how people go about it. So if you are looking for that kind of overview you are going to be disappointed, I simply wanted to talk through some thoughts I had in using the two operating systems without comparing apples to oranges. As time goes on it becomes apparent that both operating systems, although trying to achieve the same thing, are approaching it from different angles. This gives a stark contrast to those daring to switch between the two – something that has become increasingly harder.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Android, although pouring in digital wellbeing features, still seems insistent on bombarding you with notifications on everything you’ve ever Google searched. Indeed you can switch these off (ish) but it’s not easy to find nor understand. The fact still remains that Google make nothing from Android and hardly anything from Google Play, so they need to keep your attention somehow. My biggest concern with using Android has always been my privacy exchange, however in my honest opinion this is an issue the average user doesn’t care about nor understand. So for me to talk about this while discussing using the OS is moot.</p>
<p>Indeed Android is the more useful operating system, it makes it much easier to interact with notifications and find things you need instantly. Google was the trail blazer in giving users tools for free that typically cost money and monetising it in other ways – see Google Maps for an example. All of the stock software on both operating systems is there is make your life easier, and push you further into the eco system.</p>
<p>Apple may not be in the business on monetising your data, but the OS and all the free apps that go with it are there to pull you in so they can sell you other things. Services and subscriptions have become a focus for Apple in recent years, and this is evident now more than ever, pre installed Music and even now the AppStore itself with Apple Arcade, pushes you towards giving Apple money – just in a far more subtle way than Google.</p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>I am always fascinated by Android handsets, a huge selling point for Android is that it is far more exciting from a hardware perspective. You are guaranteed to find an handset that is suited to you use case however niche it might be. I chose to use a Note 10+ because I wanted something business like with a top camera, but there is a phone at almost every price point to suite almost everyone. Whereas you are stuck using whatever Apple design of it fits or not.</p>
<p>Should Apple go in a different direction to what you need from their hardware, you are stuck. A decision to move everything to another eco system and bare the pain of loosing apps and services (as well as the hassle of moving all of your data) is a truly live changing thing. Sure Apple charge a premium for making all the design decision for you, but what happens when you don’t agree?</p>
<p>In exchange for giving up control you get the best source of high quality, diverse and sometimes expensive software in existence. Apples App Store still trumps Google Play for quality of apps by a long chalk, although the standard on Android is much better than even a couple of years ago. Couple this with the pretty regular killing of Googles own services, there is always frustration when switching.</p>
<p>Apps from the same developer often work different, look different or are missing functions (even Googles) on Android. Which is a huge shame given the open nature of the platform. Sure you can ‘do anything’ with your device, but the quality of software to go with it is still lacking in broad terms – and this becomes apparent very quickly when switching.</p>
<p>The fact remains that my love of Android still runs deep into my heart but I feel much safer and better supported when popping my sim back into an iOS device. This of course is simply my opinion, you can use whatever you wish – Android is great.</p>

<p>I like to pretend I am often asked, but I’m not. I am seldom asked – but the fact remains that I am asked. Exactly how I do the things I do, how do I take part in podcasts, present a persona online and interact with people on a daily basis building a business. I enjoy the shocked faces from people when I reply, “I don’t really know”.</p>
<p>You might interact with me on a professional level, you might tweet at me online, or you might listen to one of my podcasts. Wherever it is that you interact with me, I am eternally grateful, but what you don’t see is the behind the scenes footage.</p>
<p>You might listen to the 3 hour podcast with an interesting guest, or hear me talk about Apple news on BYOD. What you don’t hear is the 45 minute pep talk I’ve had to give myself just to start that show. The excuses to run away and not bother doing anything, and the almost crippling imposter syndrome that I have.</p>
<p>I constantly have to battle with myself, not only because I’m <a href="https://gr36.com/im-an-outgoing-introvert/">actually an introvert</a>, but because I fear the reaction to everything I do. I want to create, I want to produce and I want to do more, but much of the time my mind just wont let me.</p>
<p>I get the impression I am not alone, but thankfully I am pretty good at talking to myself, and getting over the feelings of dread. It doesn’t stop everything that I do any more, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t affect me. My love of creating out-ways my constant self doubt. I have a motivation for life and doing things that make me happy, and I hope others find this themselves.</p>
<p>You see this is not a cry for help, more a motivational call to say that others feel the same. Be kinder to yourself my friends.</p>

<p>Almost two years on there is still a lot of scepticism around Face ID. For me it works fine, but others seem to have issues, or different use cases and struggle quite a bit. So either from inside information or shear hope, talk of Apple returning to Touch ID still exists. It’s hard to see Apple ‘backtracking’ because they see FaceID as the future, but perhaps the best way is to have multiple methods.</p>
<p>Since picking up the Note10+ it has become obvious to me that under screen finger print sensors are still a bit rubbish. Better ones exit, such as the OnePlus 7, but they are still a bit slow and unreliable. Implementation of them seems like a step backwards, but combine this with face unlock and the Note10 is the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Pick the device up and it looks for your face straight away, the face unlock is no where near as good as Face ID, but a large percentage of the time it’s unlocked before you realise it. Should this fail, then placing your finger on the screen is pretty easy for the few times it fails. In fact many times users are already touching the screen ready to use it, security features that fade into the background and stop being a consideration are the best designed.</p>
<p>The real solution could be slightly less stringent matching of both the finger and face combined, tolerances could be lower to make sure matches are easier, but combined together means much more secure system. A system that checks for multiple points is both secure and user friendly. Someone might know your PIN number, but iOS knows that it isn’t you so perhaps only allows access to certain parts of the OS.</p>
<p>Whats the odds of someone having a similar face and a very similar finger print? Even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/health/the-claim-identical-twins-have-identical-fingerprints.html">identical twins</a> don’t have the same finger prints, so no evil twin breaking into your phone any longer! Apple could then take things further with Apple Watch authentification, WiFi and Bluetooth options – the possibilities are endless.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Although I have used an iPad pro with pencil for several years, it is always when using a Galaxy Note that I appreciate using a stylus. Samsungs S-Pen is the quintessential stylus, the phone that brought it back from the dead after being killed by Steve Jobs. The phone features a 6.8” display meaning touch interfaces are plenty large enough, but still manages to make a stylus useful.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, you soon realise that Samsung got something very right when introducing a stylus. When the original version hit the shelves, many people bought it solely for the screen size, but now when everything is that size and more prominent, users buy it for the stylus and Samsung hit it perfectly.</p>
<p>With each new version of the Galaxy Note seems to pack in new features to the tiny stylus, very few are actually useful. Potentially a camera button introduced with the Note9 might help in some situations, no one wants to use there stylus like a magic wand to swipe through photos or interact with the display.</p>
<p>The S-Pen not only gives you the option to handwrite things but by aiming at creatives Samsung have realised that a whole new interaction level can take place. I can now scrub through a video with my finger while trimming the start and finish down with the S-Pen. I have a much more accurate control on sliders or touching up small areas of a photo just by popping a pen out the bottom of my device.</p>
<p>The S-Pen is much more than a device for handwriting – although it is better at it now than ever – it is a whole different interaction level. Once I press the button and pull out the stylus, I have navigation and interaction options other phones don’t have with just touch. The real beauty also is I don’t have to use it or even see it when not in use, it isn’t stuck to the side of my device, it is just a click away.</p>

     <p>Whilst looking at options to add a ‘tip’ service to my blog, I looked at what felt like a never-ending stream of them. There are no shortage of options, ranging from full on monthly subscriptions, to occasional buy me a coffee type platforms. I <a href="https://ko-fi.com/gregmorris">went for the latter</a> to see if I can monetise the work I do with my ‘How To’ posts. I found reading the marketing copy on these websites really eye-opening, and it started me thinking about monetisation of the content I make.</p><p>One such website <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com">Buy Me A Coffee</a> has the tag line ”A supporter is worth a thousand followers”. Which sums perfectly up the outlook of those looking to gain something back for the work they put in. My self included, of course. I have been trying to get something back, if only to cover the costs of hosting, for almost a decade with very little success.</p><p>As I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/asking-giving-and/">wrote at the start of this year,</a> “The web is much different now than even that brief time ago”. It is still a little hard to accept that the number of people making a living from writing on the web is so small when compared to a few years ago. A few dedicated supporters well outweigh, in terms of revenue, thousands upon thousands of page views.</p><p>I am still overwhelmed when people read my posts, even more so when people give me feedback, and amazed that anyone ever felt enough motivation to donate to me. I value all of these people equally. The anonymous readers that never say a word, read the advice they need from a post and then leave. My followers on Twitter that occasionally like and retweet my nonsense. Or the people that I have met online that I now consider friends.</p><p>Sure, it would be nice to motivate more people <a href="https://ko-fi.com/gregmorris">to support me</a>, but that is not why I do it. I am already a success because that <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/what-does-success-look-like/">looks very different to me</a> in comparison to whom these tip services are primarily aimed at — but supporters do help!</p>

     <p>For those of you not following me on Twitter (and why not <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1461374261491384330?s=20">I’m hilarious</a>) I bought an Xbox Series X. I’m not a big gamer by any stretch, but having <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/love-stadia/">played Stadia</a> for quite a while I thought it was time to branch out on some hardware, and I am so glad I did.</p><p>Those of us that have busy lives or just generally kids and partners that need attention, know the realisation you don’t really have time to play games any more. Many people's modern lives are not conductive to playing for long periods of time, and as such we often miss out completely. There are some thoughts on games getting much shorter to complete, but the average game still takes <a href="https://www.looper.com/297615/how-long-would-it-take-to-beat-every-video-game/">more than 25 hours</a> to polish off.</p><p>If you’ve been nodding along and thinking the same as I, let me introduce you to the wonderful world of <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/hardware-network/power/learn-about-power-modes">instant on</a>. Available on both new Xbox versions (and I think the PS5) it removes a major sticking point of gaming for me. With instant on there are no credits to watch, no introductions to get through and very little loading at all. You can be in a game within seconds, and it’s glorious.</p><p>Sure, instant on might be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/how-the-xboxs-default-instant-on-feature-could-harm-the-environment/">killing the planet</a> a little faster, so I guess my gushing should taper a little. However, the fact that I can grab a small slice of time to myself in between everything else I have to do has been brilliant. I can leave races midway through on Forza when duty calls or go and do something between matches in Fifa, all without having to worry my game is paused somewhere — which was my solution before.</p><p>I am never going to be able to sit down and game for long periods of time, but the small 20 or 30 minutes here and there mean I might actually play some games again. The small hump of motivation to actually switch the Xbox on and not have to update GB worth downloads nor watch credits might just save my sanity a little. Praise MS for Instant On.</p>

     <p>I recently came to the realisation that I seldom look at the photos on my phone. For years I always wanted the best possible camera to capture every single moment of my kids growing up. It was part of me, and something I enjoyed doing, yet I <em>never</em> look at them.</p><p>I am sure one day I will be glad I do all this clicking. Don’t get me wrong, I am a long way from <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/life-through-a/">living life through a lens</a>, but I like to capture everything. They might come in handy when age catches up with me and I rely on all of these captured memories to spark the ones in my mind. Until then, they sit waiting for a possible future where I am old but still own a smartphone.</p><p>Despite hardly looking at them, they still mean a lot to me. They are simple family snaps. Some adorn our walls, displaying the family times we enjoy so much. I can look at a simple photo and feel all the things that I felt at the time and be instantly transported. They fill this strange place where they are priceless to me, yet are images that if anyone else looked at them would be worthless.</p><p>They are not a sum of their parts. They don’t contain world-class composition and expertly exposed colours (all things I fuss over in my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/">other photos</a>) because they don’t need to. These photos capture a snapshot of a time that will never exist again, and in it trap all kinds of emotions. Not only that, but they tell stories of what we were up to at that point, the things we did and how far things have changed.</p><p>Despite this realisation, I will continue to snap loads of digital memories. Still buy iCloud storage and better camera phones every year because I know I am building value. They mean everything to me.</p>

     <p>Since <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/migrating-from-wordpress/">first trying Ghost</a>, one of the best things about editing my theme is the ability to host on Github. Through a simple integration I can easily edit my theme to make changes from almost anywhere. If you want to do this too, this guide should help you out.</p>
<h2 id="ghost-integration">Ghost Integration</h2>
<p>First set up the Github integration on your Ghost install, this provides you with an API Key that you will need when using Github. Head to the settings cog at the bottom of you control panel and click on Integrations.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e0d0564529.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Create a new integration and give it a name. On the next screen make a note of the Admin API URL and the Admin API Key. Please keep these private as these allow access to your blog content.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bc80373cc6.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="github-set-up">Github Set Up</h2>
<p>Secondly you will need to host all of your themes files on Github. Make a private repo, give it a name that represents your theme and head to settings &gt; secrets. Click ‘New repository secret’ and set up <code>GHOST_ADMIN_API_URL</code> and <code>GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY</code> with the integration details you set up earlier.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/87fe123509.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="796" /></figure>
<p>Once you have done this upload all of your theme files to the repo and commit them. The last step is to create a new file in your repo <code>.github/workflows/main.yml</code>. This file needs to contain the following.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">name: Deploy Theme
on:
 push:
 branches:
 - master
 - main
jobs:
 deploy:
 runs-on: ubuntu–18.04
 steps:
 - uses: actions/checkout@master
 - uses: TryGhost/action-deploy-theme@v1.4.1
 with:
 api-key: ${{ secrets.GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY }}
</code></pre>
<p>This theme will now show up in your design settings, however you will need to make a change to you theme to trigger this. Adding in some text to your readme file is the easiest way.</p>
<p>You can now make changes to your theme through whatever way is easiest for you. I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>, but on iPad I found the best app is <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a>. Every time you push a change GitHub will build your site and them push these to your live site, this usually takes less than a minute.</p>

The rate of publishing and the things being published has been a big theme of my thoughts of late. I’m not worried about being the first or the best, but I like to write <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/something-to-say/">things that mean something</a>.</p><p>I got pretty good at telling what devices were going to be useful when reviewing numerous phones. Sure, I still got caught up in the excitement, but devices like the Galaxy S21 Ultra and the Galaxy Fold 3 I could tell within a day or so if they made any difference to me. But of course, I had to handle a lot of tech to do this.</p><p>If anything I am the reverse now, I dismiss things and then when I actually read or watch reviews I start to see where they could benefit my workflow.</p><p>With all this said, I always try to take in reviews after time with the device. I have lost count of the number of videos reviews I watch claiming the device is the best thing ever, only to have another on a few weeks later on why they are returning it. Some of this is of course YouTubers being YouTubers, but the honeymoon period feelings are strong and should be considered.</p>

     <p>I am very dismissive of publishing my thoughts on many topics tech related. More so about devices and news that I am very late on. I figure that most people have already read or watched what they need to from the real tech people. Ones that get the product first or find something new and published the first article.</p><p>I am not the only one that feels like this, and it’s not just technology. Game reviews are also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/10/12/video-game-reviews-bad-system/">considered broken</a> by many because smaller reviewers stand little to no chance of being heard when the review things weeks after bigger sites. I have spent years fighting the negative feeling of my hard work ending up getting very little attention. These thoughts very often make me wonder if to bother at all and I see this in many others.</p><blockquote>You don’t write because you want to say something, you write because you have something to say.“ by F. Scott Fitzgerald.</blockquote><p>Except I do. We all should. If we have something to say, that should be said (written, painted, acted, whatever medium you choose), do it. If you have thoughts that you <em>want</em> to express, just because others have similar thoughts doesn’t make them any less valid. I don’t publish because I want to publish things, I do it because I have something that I want to publish.</p><p>It’s an easy mistake to make. I made some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh8W4NIk9kL_l8YEAd5KIDQ">technology review videos</a> in years gone by because I just wanted to make technology videos. I didn’t have something to say really, I just wanted to be a “YouTuber” like others I look up to. Don’t get me wrong, I think they came out OK, and I continue to make videos currently — but it was for the wrong reasons and quietly died out.</p><p>Feeling these feelings of not being heard is not unusual, but if you have something to say, say it — but don’t say it just because you simply want to talk.</p>

     <p>I don’t usually frequent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy</a>, but I stray into it sometimes just to see what crazy is going on in the world. Like macabre entertainment that makes me feel a little better about myself. Gone are Bigfoot and aliens, replaced with COVID-19 vaccination fear and politicians being pedophiles, with the occasional randomness thrown in. One <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qu8div/its_weird_that_we_have_to_buy_new_phones_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">such post</a> caught my eye that discussed the need to have modern devices to just view webpages, and it has a point.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong. The thoughts are muddled, the technology knowledge very thin — but like a child with a stick, they hit the point somewhere along the road. The web is a mess. Full of tracking, adverts and complex things that all need to load. Sure, they may look nice when viewing them with a good connection and a nice device, but if you don’t, the web can suck.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can find fantastic articles online. I hope to one day write such a post. But I find it increasingly difficult to consume these. The internet, as it's built today, is a bad experience to consume long-form content. I much rather read a 300 pages book than a 3000-word article.</p>— Kevin Wammer (@cliophate) <a href="https://twitter.com/cliophate/status/1460164332835287041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2021</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>Consuming content often means you have to put up with some of the worst websites. Ones that suck all the life out of the web, consuming resources and slowing down the load time down to a crawl. Not to mention the acceptable practice of popping things up in front of your face, most of them not properly optimised. The result of all this is often a terrible experience, and users have a habit of blaming the hardware in their hands.</p><p>Kevin Wammer went on from the tweet above to talk about this a few days ago. The fact that I often have to save an article to a read later service (<a href="https://www.getupnext.com">Upnext is wonderful</a>) is a testament to how broken everything really is. Instead of building the best possible experience for users, much of the web is made for the most gain possible. It might be displaying adverts, it might be putting up a paywall, or it might just be for attention. It all boils down to personal gain and nothing more. Greed broke the web and it may never recover.</p>

     <p>In what seems like another life, I spent a few years working for massive corporations. You know the type. Thousands of employees with several layers of bureaucracy yet you only actually speak to a handful of them. Communication was stale and cold, filtered through HR and marketing teams before it hit your inbox. There was no emotion in them, no story telling and very little actual communication.</p><p>You learnt to de-cdoe the words in to their actual meanings. Read between the lines and work out what was actually being said. Far too much energy had to go towards the interpretation of the false words and how best to action them. Unfortunately, in this dog-eat-dog world, in many situations this meant working out how to protect yourself. The burning realisation that at any moment the company could change the way they do things, and you could be surplus to requirements leads to constant paranoia.</p><blockquote>Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon's razor</a></blockquote><p>This wasn’t all bad, I suppose. I did develop a pretty thick skin as well as becoming pretty good at reading people. Now, in my calmer days, working in a job I love to bits, I have come to realise that worrying about what other people think is a fool's game. Trying to second guess things, and read between the lines in most situations gives you nothing but a headache and paranoid delusions. My approach to the actions of others now follows Hanlon’s razor above.</p><p>Once you adopt this viewpoint, it’s surprising how a large portion of what you may have previously worried about is just the stupidity of others. When the reality is that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/11/how-stop-caring-what-other-people-think-you/620670/">no one really cares about you</a>, or puts as much though into you as you do towards them. Having a <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-scout-mindset/">scout mindset</a> and giving people the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise is the best way to be.</p>

     <p>I’ve been having a bit of a bad time currently. A few issues in my professional life coupled with being extremely busy has lead to me not being my usual self. Simmering in my grumpiness last night sat on my own and all I can hear is squeak, squeak, squeak. Looking over at my dog going to town chewing on his favourite toy. Ripping it to shreds and wagging his tail like the crazy dog he is. He’s in his element. Captivated by something so simple and experiencing pure bliss, and I want to know where my chew toy is.</p><p>I’d love to go back to a time when I valued something so highly that it was able to remove me from the world entirely. Captivate my attention and keep me entertained in a euphoric state for as long as I let it. I remember the times when a new colouring book would do this to me. Leave me oblivious to the world around me while I gave the blank pages a colourful facelift whilst sticking my tongue out. I don’t think the things around me have changed all that much, but I certainly have.</p><p>It’s not the things that put us in this state, it’s our ability to surrender to them. To let ourselves enjoy something with 100% of our being. Ever tried one of those adult colouring books? A perfect activity for a little while, and then your brain reminds you about all the adult things you should be doing instead and pops the little bubble of delight you had going. It is hard being an adult in a world that has so many demands on us, but that doesn’t mean we can’t get a chew toy every now and again, does it.</p><p>So, I sat looking at this happy little boy, ripping up his favourite toy and having the time of his life. All I could do is smile, laugh and soak in the second hand enjoyment. I instantly started to feel better because Charlie taught me something. To let go every once in a while and not dwell on things you can’t do anything about. Just enjoy your chew toy.</p>

     <p>I used to be OK with email. Even in my day job I didn’t get much of it, I was one for picking the phone up and talking to people instead. My relationship wasn’t all roses, but it was certainly maintainable. Then something changed. During the pandemic, email shifted. Evolving into something else entirely, and I wonder where it’s going.</p><p>When shops were closed, businesses slowed to a crawl and our internal communication not yet ready for the word of Slack channels, my inbox began to explode. Every company wanted my attention, had new offers for me to explore, and of course all the conversations we had in person went somewhere else.</p><blockquote>Email used to be a place where you had conversations, but as conversations have moved to text and DMs, it’s increasingly become a place where you store receipts, arrange appointments, collect announcements, and now, receive newsletters. — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/11/03/we-havent-reached-peak-newsletter-not-by-a-long-shot-519207">Jack Shafer</a></blockquote><p>If we want to look at why this is the case, of course I asked for these emails. I said yes, it was OK for my bank to keep me updated about their new products. Agreed that the company that I bought flowers from 3 months ago could let me know when my next anniversary is, but I didn’t expect this. What was once the electronic version of posting a note to a friend is now <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/08/why-stores-send-you-so-many-emails-spam/619670/">a battleground for my attention,</a> and also where I get my news.</p><p>That is because almost all of my favourite journalism is now delivered into my inbox. Personalised and funded by me from the writers that I love (<a href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/617ed0db788a020020bcc60c/hey-its-galaxy-brain-2-0/">Galaxy Brain</a> is seriously the best). Newsletters were the biggest tech boom of 2020, and I love it, but looking at this objectively, how can these two things exist side by side in my inbox. The solution may be to use something like Hey, the service I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/hey-whats-wrong-with-your-email/">was obsessed with for a hot minute</a>. It lets me separate everything out, but I am not convinced that’s good enough.</p><p>None of us want email to be this complicated. Granted, I can unsubscribe from as much stuff as possible, but I do like the occasional sale email and tempting bargain waved in front of my face. I can’t give up on well times emails <a href="https://www.equinox24.co.uk">about events</a> I want to enter again this year and reminders for birthdays. I shouldn’t have to choose between what goes where because email now hates me. This is without even talking about corporate email.</p><p>The relentless things keep popping into Outlook all day, every day, trying their damn hardest to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/going-deeper/">distract me from getting things done</a>. Gone are the days I can leave the app minimised on my desktop because some time recently we seem to have all unconsciously agreed that email must be answered straight away. Nothing comes after work email either. You can all move to Slack or Teams as much as you like, but that just means you’ve got two things to check now because no one stops sending damn emails! All. The. Time.</p><p>I can’t figure out what email is now. It’s a weird mixture of first class journalism and marketing neediness. I can deal with Social Media wanting my attention, what I can’t deal with is losing the most important communication channel I have outside of actual human contact. Help.</p>

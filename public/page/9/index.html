      <p>Manuel Moreale ponders what he would pay for if you had to <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pay-per-scroll">pay per scroll</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>think about what the web would look like if it was some sort of pay-per-scroll platform. Not a place where virtually everything is free but a place where everything has to be purchased in order to be consumed.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is quite an old post, one that pops up from time to time in my saved quotes. It always makes me pause. I remember it for a few days, and then I promptly slip back into my old ways.</p>
<p>Users like things free. They love free. But what if they began to frame things as if they are paying (which, of course, they are - with time and attention)? Both users and developers know we wouldn’t pay for the mediocre content we see online; hence, everything has infinite scroll now. Even the short pause of loading a new page of content would provide enough breathing room to recognise how terrible this is.</p>
<p>Yet here we are. Scrolling. Forever.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>After <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/07/03/the-current-struggle.html">my post the other day</a> about struggling with what’s going on in my life, I’ve been thinking a lot more about blogging. My mind is still a long way from framing the world in blog posts again, but I’ve realised how important my blog is to me. When the going gets tough and there are challenges to cope with, I always reach for my blog as a refuge.</p>
<p>Writing is a well-known method for coping with life’s difficulties, even if you don’t publish what you write. However, there’s something uniquely special about having a blog—one that people read and interact with. The support that can form around it is incredible. I received several kind replies wishing me well, and more than one person took the time to send me an email with words of encouragement. While this isn’t my primary motivation for writing, it’s heartwarming to receive such support.</p>
<p>My blog has been a constant presence in my life in various forms for more than a decade. It’s always there for me to rely on. Over the weekend, while sitting in the hospital for hours on end, I began reading other people’s posts and publishing my own. There’s no need for social media boredom relief when your blogging workflow takes over. It also helps when there are plenty of things to write about, as it keeps my mind engaged and productive.</p>
<p>During the first few days of managing everything on my own, I felt overwhelmed. Yet, my mind instinctively started to draft a blog post. Moments later, it was written and published. This spontaneous act of writing helped me process my feelings and organise my thoughts. It’s amazing how important my blog has become to me—it’s not just a platform for sharing my experiences but also a therapeutic tool that helps me navigate life’s challenges.</p>
<p>Blogging has provided me with an outlet for my emotions and a way to connect with others who may be going through similar experiences. It’s a space where I can be honest about my struggles and triumphs, and receive support from a community of readers. This sense of connection and understanding is invaluable. My blog is much more than just a hobby; it’s a vital part of my life. I’m grateful to have my blog as a constant companion and source of support.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I don’t mind admitting it, but at the moment I am really struggling. My life is not easy at the best of times, coping with a child that needs extra care, but now my wife has been taken down by gastroenteritis, and I don’t know how single parents cope.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t the first time this has happened. My wife seems to catch every issue that’s floating around due to working in education, including COVID before any vaccines and treatments were available. However, it is the first time I have really felt like I am on a treadmill. There’s always something that needs doing!</p>
<p>Balancing all the house chores, kids’ stuff, and working full time means that I am severely sleep-deprived and lacking the ability to grab some peace and quiet for more than a few minutes. I honestly don’t know how single parents do all the things they do. After months of using decaffeinated coffee, I’ve had to reach for the hard stuff simply to stop myself from falling asleep.</p>
<p>I have hope that my wife will start to feel better soon, although that light at the end of the tunnel does not seem to have been switched on yet. We split the work needed to keep our home running pretty evenly anyway, but this is a struggle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The implication is that somehow it was wrong for them to transition from snapshots of family events, etc. to being more artful in taking photographs to put online. Let&rsquo;s be clear: there is nothing wrong with this!</p></blockquote>
<p>Absolutely, there is nothing wrong with this. Perhaps my point came across wrong.</p>
<p>I am a street photographer first and foremost and my camera roll is filled with all sorts of random photos. My point was more that people worry to much about getting the right shot than enjoying and capturing the moment. Over posing and worrying about getting the perfect shot to share on Instagram, rather than snapping moments.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>An interesting post in the Totally Recommend newsletter on the <a href="https://totallyrecommend.substack.com/p/i-regret-whats-in-my-camera-roll">degradation of their camera roll</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ten years ago, my photos weren&rsquo;t as crisp as they are now, but they did the job of capturing personal stories and connections….these photos are filled with the faces of my friends and family from seemingly unremarkable but unforgettable times together.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Over time, my photos begin to transform. The &ldquo;stupid but sweet&rdquo; snapshots start to give way to something different. There is a new focus, an attempt to present an aesthetic, an idea, an editorial &ldquo;look.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is something I have seen in the camera rolls of many of my friends. They no longer capture and post snapshots of their lives; instead, their Instagram feeds resemble those of low-key influencers. Everything is polished and perfect (well, as perfect as they can make it) with image upon image of nothingness.</p>
<p>Smiling faces and silly captures have been replaced with landscapes of places they visited simply to take photos. Perhaps there’s the occasional shot of a person from behind, pretending to watch something, yet no images of the thing itself.</p>
<p>Photos are meant to be memory prompts—captures of moments you want to remember or snapshots of enjoyable times. Those blurry, grainy candid photos you barely managed to grab as you fumbled for your camera are utterly perfect. The moment is spoiled because your phone is in front of your face the whole time, not so much.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>In an effort to motivate myself to write more regularly, I’ve decided to consolidate my small updates into one post each week. This may last only a week or it may stick—I&rsquo;ve started and abandoned so many creative projects that it&rsquo;s hard to say. But I can try.</p>
<h2 id="photography">Photography</h2>
<p>My increased focus on photography has led to a decline in my writing. While my shots may not be anything extraordinary, I find the practice enjoyable and meditative.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve previously written about my difficulty in pursuing more than one creative activity at a time, and I still don&rsquo;t know why that is. I now see the world through the lens of a camera, capturing moments in time. Previously, I viewed it as material for blog posts. I feel most at home wandering around, looking for interesting scenes, seeing the world from a different perspective, and focusing solely on capturing it, without the distraction of life&rsquo;s other stresses.</p>
<h2 id="london-calling">London Calling</h2>
<p>Due to my love of street photography, I’ve been visiting London frequently. Living in a rural area makes it challenging to pursue urban photography, but fortunately, it doesn’t take long to get to the city.</p>
<p>If I lived there, I’d probably grow tired of it, but for now, I find the contrast in lifestyles between London and my home fascinating. The hustle and bustle are refreshing, and the city is perfect for street photography.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-things">Fixing Things</h2>
<p>We’ve been in our current house for almost six years now, and the newly built features are starting to show their age all at once. This past week, I had to replace our washing machine, strip down and repair the dishwasher, and now the boiler is making strange noises.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I can handle most repairs and at least diagnose issues, if not fix them myself (with the exception of gas and heating systems, for obvious reasons). But it&rsquo;s still frustrating. It feels like everything decided to break simultaneously, testing my patience and my bank balance. I hope nothing else breaks in the near future!</p>

      <p>Today was supposed to be a subdued day after our long walk yesterday, but my life just doesn’t work like that. After reading part of the excellent book <a href="https://amzn.to/3wNRuxK">Find Your Frame by Craig Whitehead</a>, I felt inspired. When I woke up and saw the sun shining early in the morning, I decided to go out instead. Lately, the weather has been terrible here for May and June, but the forecast looked good.</p>
<p>I chose a familiar place since I am heading to London this week, so Nottingham streets are my favorite. During this visit, I tried to shoot much slower than I normally would. I found a shot and waited for the right moment to capture it. Some of the photos I took in my short couple of hours I really like.</p>
<p>In Find Your Frame, Craig encourages you to discover what you want to shoot and experiment with different styles. I can&rsquo;t stay away from light and shadows, though.</p>

      <p>This must be the period for spontaneity because after last weekends trip to Nottingham, today we just decided to head to the seaside for a couple of hours after work.</p>
<p>When I say the lift was rubbish, you better believe it. Someone needs to tell the world that it’s almost June because there was about 20mins sunshine all day.</p>
<p>However the place was packed with people enjoying themselves so you can’t complain, just join in.</p>
<p>Grabbed a few shots on my XT5 but nothing special.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we’re now shifting towards the model where devs are instead “AI” wranglers. The web dev of the future will be an underpaid generalist who pokes at chatbot output until it runs without error, pokes at a copilot until it generates tests that pass with some coverage, and ships code that nobody understand and can’t be fixed if something goes wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of the things I fear. That the web will break and no one will know how to fix it.</p>

      <p>I did something that I never do. Got up early and went to shoot some street photos. There was already a long day lined up but I had a creative itch that I hadn’t been able to scratch for a while, and it needed satisfying.</p>
<p>It was a really enjoyable 2 hours in Nottingham in the only two hours sunshine they might have. I can really feel my motivation to shoot street photography coming back and my eye for a good shot improving.</p>

<p>A few years ago I used to write a lot about Lucie. Mention her a lot in posts about my life and also wrote a few from her perspective. Making light of situations when in reality it was my way of coping with feelings and emotions.</p>
<p>The greatest issue of which is lost sleep, and in a cruel twits of fate as I lay wide awake at a ridiculous time of the morning an old post shows up on <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-12-20-day-one-review/">Day One</a> and it seems nothing has changed in two years.</p>
<p>Lucie has <a href="https://gr36.com/2016-12-27-hello-4am/">always been up at silly times of the day</a> and I don’t think it’s ever going to change. Sleep is something I now have a very strange relationship with, all thanks to my daughter who appears to not need any! As much as we try and provide as least distraction as possible, all the safety features and ridiculous amount of medication – her sleep is a constant issue. This invariably means me laying awake and writing blog posts or getting up and trying to mediate the noise so no one else wakes up.</p>
<p>I still have yet to work out the magic combination that allows us to get a reasonable about of sleep. Where’s as ‘normal’ children will have a bad nights sleep every so often, we are the reverse. We get a full night sleep once an a blue mood and rely on each other to keep going. Self medicating with coffee is perhaps not the answer but I did get a nice coffee machine for Christmas so it might help a little.</p>
<p>Think about me when you’re all tucked up in bed and relaxing. I will be the one chasing my daughter around the house to stop her working on a new techno beat by smashing two toys together.</p>

<p>For years of my life I have been consuming the worst kind of blog posts. You know the ones – “successful people do this” or “10 task manager tricks to make you better”. I’ve read so many of these that Pocket surfaces what seems like every version of them on the planet. I’ve watched <a href="/2018-04-04-productivity-set-up-videos/">hundreds of videos</a> on the subject, spent loads of money on apps, and caused my self so much stress. All because I wanted to be better, do more, and I was convinced the secret was out there somewhere.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whilst putting the world to rights on the Outline podcast, Daryl asked me if I am ever happy with my set up. Of course the answer is no! I am never happy and constantly try and improve my productivity and set up. – Greg Morris, <a href="/2018-04-04-productivity-set-up-videos/">The Strange World Of Productivity Set Up Videos.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>When all along there was a pretty simple word that allowed me to be more productive, actually achieve more, and work much smarter. That word was NO – and it came as a reply to many questions that started with the phrase “could you just”.</p>
<p>You see I could “just do this” and “see if I could do that” but in reality I couldn’t do anything more than I already did. It wasn’t more tasks I needed, it was better tasks and a higher outcome from them. There is no quick and easy step, there is no golden secret waiting in all of these posts. If there were tips around to suddenly ‘turbocharge’ your productivity then everyone would know it, and there would be no need for literally millions of words on the subject.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am a robot, programmed to obliterate my to-do list. – David Sbarra, <a href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/i-trained-myself-to-be-less-busy-and-it-dramatically-improved-my-life">I trained myself to be less busy — and it dramatically improved my life</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>Ditched GTD</h2>
<p>The first step was to get rid of my habit of writing everything into my task manger. I know people swear by the Getting Things Done principles, but if it’s in the task list it feels as though you now <em>have</em> to do it. That’s not to say don’t write down things that you may forget, but actually think about what you are putting in there.</p>
<p>Should I be doing this?<br />
Who should be doing this?<br />
What is the benefit to me?<br />
What is the benefit to a larger goal?</p>
<p>If it simply doesn’t seem relevant, it doesn’t go in, simple. I’ve become much more <a href="https://amzn.to/2Rfn4NZ">focused on Essentialism</a>, and surprisingly managed to squeeze more into my day. Simply because I’ve said no to things that are not going to benefit me or those around me, or that I simply can get out of doing. I’ve learnt to focus my time onto things that really need doing, and filled in the smaller tasks around me.</p>

<p>I have never shared anything like this before. Admittedly I share quite a lot but my journal entries <sup><a class="footnote" href="https://gr36.com/one-journal-snippet/1">1</a></sup> are deeply private and actually embarrassing in some instances. Yet I wrote this short snippet in today and wanted to share it with whoever reads my blog.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m writing these things for future me to read and understand this is where you made your stand. This is the lowest point that you will build from, no more stress, no more worry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of the time I don’t even realise what I am writing until I read it back. I have got into the habit of sitting down for 20mins and just letting my fingers type away and express the way the day has gone. Some times it makes little sense but it is extremely beneficial to free my mind of some feelings and thoughts.</p>
<p>I do read them back from time to time, often using the ‘on this day’ feature, as it is useful to see if I have been here before. If I have made improvements from other periods in my life, or if I can learn anything to help the ‘current me’.</p>
<p>Unfortunately at the moment I am reading and also writing the same sort of things I did at this point last year. Headaches, stress and low motivation blighting what should be a happy time of year. Don’t get me wrong I am really looking forward to spending the next 10 days relaxing, exercising, meditating and with my family.</p>
<p>However this definitely is my time to build ready for 2019. I am determined to make this a great year (I know I say this every year). I am genuinely excited to achieve more, work smarter <sup><a class="footnote" href="https://gr36.com/one-journal-snippet/2">2</a></sup> and publish more.</p>

<p>Last week we moved house. I’m not sure what possessed us to do this a week before Christmas, but we didn’t have much choice in the matter. The general belief is that this is one of the most stressful things to do, yet we project managed our way though it and it went brilliantly. Apart from one small detail – we had no internet connection or TV for a whole week.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, it is going to be great once it is installed, we have this fancy Fibre To The Property (FTP) connection, so speeds will be ridiculous. So going forward things are going to be much better, but it is only in times like this that you realise just how much you rely on an internet connection. It has also made me realise just how much interruption TV and web usage interferes in our lives.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am an exception to the rule, but I have my doubts. I am <em>very</em> connected, with podcasting, writing and interacting on social media, there is barely a time I am bored. Yet being without Television has made us interact more as a family. For the past week we have simply been in each others company – talked, played and actually been bored together. Both myself and my wife have meditated more, eaten better and been present at every moment for our children.</p>
<p>We did this before, we make a point of eating meals together, doing homework and all these great family things. Although in the past how much of this has been undermined by a background noise of TV or music? Just the sheer presence of these things is bound to have an effect. Although I am really excited to get an internet connection back, I am really pleased this has happened. If only to draw attention to our usage of electronic entertainment, and build habits that will carry on in our new home.</p>

<p>I know this might sound surprising and bordering on impossible, but over the past couple of weeks I think I have discovered a huge trigger for my occasional depressive periods.</p>
<p>Generally speaking I am, what my wife would call “annoyingly positive”, but much of my time is inter-spliced with darker periods. I don’t suffer like some people do, but for more than 10 years I have felt like I am riding a roller coaster. Periods of ups and downs that seem to happen with no real pattern. Resent changes in my life have required me to readdress and look at many areas of my life, and now I realise that this is very much tied to my feeling of self worth and being appreciated.</p>
<p>I would like to think that I work hard at everything I do, it doesn’t matter if it’s podcasting, in the gym, looking after my family or indeed my professional life. I don’t do it for money, fame, titles, cars, house or anything else material, yet a simple well done and a bit of appreciation is all I crave. I don’t need to be held up and rewarded, but I think I’m not alone when I say – just feeling part of a team goes a long way.</p>
<p>It certainly would appear that it isn’t just me, after doing some reach on the subject, Johann Hari’s book <a href="https://thelostconnections.com/">Lost Connections</a> points to similar links to depression. Feelings of isolation, lost community and self worth are, in his opinion, the leading cause of a ‘depression epidemic’. I cant speak to this applying to everyone, but it is proving a massive factor for me. I am already aware I spend <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-10-28-too-much-time-alone/">too much time alone</a>, which does <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-11-13-outgoing-introvert/">help me to some degree</a> – but feelings of self worth and isolation may be pulling me down more than I think.</p>

<p>So, here’s the thing. I receive loads of emails from random PR companies to test products, not as many as real tech reviewers, but enough. They claim to give you free products, but actually want you to pay for them first. I’ve been burnt a few times so typically decline. However I was intrigued to try some AirPods alternatives and I wish I hadn’t bothered.</p>
<p>That isn’t to say there aren’t earbuds out there that can live up to the functionality of Apples foray into true wireless. It is simply the fact that I see so many claim that they are alternatives when in reality they are not even comparable. These Miyun versions are no exception, and no hidden gem.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-06-22-mjyun-wireless-case-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/32d7980365.jpg" alt="2018 06 22 mjyun wireless case 1" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<p>Indeed they are a fraction of the price, because frankly there is no getting around the fact that many of the new breed of truly wireless earbuds are eye wateringly expensive. I didn’t expect them to be equal, but in true B movie style, I expected them to at least be somewhere near.</p>
<p>They come in a nice, robust case, offering a neat charging solution with supplied micro USB cable. The build quality feels surprisingly robust to a level that I am frankly astonished at. With that said, Apple resort to using a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/AirPods">ridiculous amount of glue</a>, so I would expect these to be no different, an illusion of quality if you will.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Sound</strong></strong></h2>
<p>As with all earphones this is the proof of everything, the reason you by them, but it’s difficult to know where to start. The sound quality is terrible and there is no getting around it. Due to the strange twist you do when putting the earbuds in your ears the seal seems to be pretty good and cuts out lots of background noise. Unfortunately they haven’t taken advantage of this and everything sounds very shallow and distant.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-06-22-mjyun-wireless-blackberry-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/55a2674486.jpg" alt="2018 06 22 mjyun wireless blackberry 1" width="599" height="337" border="0" /></p>
<p>The bass levels are non existent and everything else seems to be forced into a much higher range than it should be. Spoken word such as podcasts and audio books are the most noticeable and make all voices sound tinny and sometimes uncomfortably high pitched.</p>
<p>Couple this with the fact that audio moves around from ear to ear and you have a very disappointing experience. I realise that these are very very cheap for true wireless earphones, but I would save your money and purchase something better sounding with wires!</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Connection Issues</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The ease of initial connection is where most cheap wireless headphones fall down. Let’s not over inflate the issue, most users are ou fait with heading to your phones setting to set up and pair. Yet for some reason this is overly complicated with a dance of buttons and connecting you must jump through simply to listen. A successful connection is following a predetermined path of connecting to one earbud, and then the other connecting to it. Stray too far from this path and resetting is your only option, condemned to try again until the Bluetooth gods accept your offering.</p>
<p>As annoying as snagging a cable is, if this is your alternative I think I would rather sit in silence. There are alternatives to AirPods out there, but these cheap offers are simply not it. I have <a href="https://www.coolsmartphone.com/2016/10/17/aukey-wireless-enough-going/">bought and enjoyed cheap Bluetooth headphones before</a> with a wire between them, removing this has proved so overly complicated that it is simply not worth the hassle. Save up, or save your time – the choice is yours.</p>

<p>Once upon a time I would ‘review’ all of my tech purchases, post several hundred if not thousand words of my thoughts and a dive into the device. For the last two models of iPad I have simply shared my thoughts through text and also <a href="https://byodpodcast.com/">podcast</a>. There are enough reviews out there for you to find out the specs and technology publication opinions – but now more than ever its important to find out the thoughts of people that actually use the device in question. Well here are mine.</p>
<p>All of the improvements Apple made to this years iPad Pro when looked at individually look quite trivial. They upgraded the internals and brought the design inline with their modern phones, removing the home button, and incorporating FaceID. Both of these things didn’t need an anylist to predict, but they have both lead to some major changes to actually using the iPad and improve almost everything about the experience. Did the change in design lead to the changes in Apple Pencil and Keyboard, or did they lead the design choices. While you argue about swings and roundabouts – I’ll tell you what’s improved and ultimately why that matters.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-11-09-iPad-pro-review-hero-1-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7377e48bc7.jpg" alt="2018 11 09 iPad pro review hero 1 1" width="600" height="300" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2>
<p>The ‘edge to edge’ screen retains some bezel around the edges, which is the best of what could have been a bad situation. All the palm rejection in the world can’t mediate holding a device to read and touching the screen constantly. However the new squared off design actually makes it much easier to handle the device. It feels almost like science fiction and without doubt almost what every device manufacturer shoots for when trying to design a perfect tablet. It’s not quite a slab of glass, but its not far off.</p>
<p>The new design is very reminiscent of an older iPhone 5 design, but with a modern feel. It also in some respects feels like a reference design for future products without hardware limitations. I am using the 11” version and it feels much larger than it actually is, a nice big screen which is still very portable and easy to also use as a consumption device.</p>
<p>The smart connector has moved to the back of the device, presumably allowing for a more device ecosystem of accessories. Very few accessories appeared for the previous side mounted version, and unfortunately I don’t seem many flooding the market with this one. Hopefully I will be disappointed, but this does allow for a much better connection using a rediculous number of magnets and an improvement to the first party keyboard.</p>
<h2><strong>Folio Keyboard</strong></h2>
<p>I have loved and loathed the Smart Keyboard in <a href="/2018-11-17-ipad-smart-keyboard/">equal amounts over the last two years</a>. The keyboard itself is great, I really enjoy typing on it, but the origami style always felt strange and the back of my iPad felt exposed. The Smart Folio solves both of these problems and I am really enjoying the improvements.</p>
<p>If you hate the keys on the previous version, you’re going to feel the same about the new one. However to me the keys feel more robust and seem to have further travel – combined with much loader clicking!</p>
<p>Using the iPad in the Smart Folio but without the keyboard feels very un-Apple like to me. For all its weirdness at least the origami needed for the Smart Keyboard hid away the keys when not in use, all be it at the expense of a strange hump on the front. The weirdness is mediated a little by how simple it is to remove the Smart Folio, and actually feel the device as Apple intended. I find myself pooping the iPad Pro out of the case when using the pencil or just browsing more than I expected.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-11-10-writing-pencil-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/879a8d56f2.jpg" alt="2018 11 10 writing pencil 1" width="599" height="399" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>New Apple Pencil</strong></h2>
<p>Apples stylus (don’t call it a stylus) is a great tool to have in my professional life, but not something I would considering buying for personal use. The first version was something I purchased and found a use for, and spent most of its time hiding in my bag for the odd time I would need to sign something. It was too long, didn’t really fit anywhere to store it and you felt silly charging it.</p>
<p>The second version mediates almost all of those issues, except the use case. Unless you’re going to draw quite often the £130 price tag will make most people baulk – the £30 price increase adds in quite a few features but wont work with any other hardware at this moment in time.</p>
<p>The second generation is shorter, more balanced and flat on one side. Making it more pencil like, and also allowing it to stick to the side of the iPad and wirelessly charge. Not only removing the need to look like a idiot every time you charge the thing, but also giving it a place to be stored and removing the anxiety enduceing end cap.</p>
<h2><strong>USB-C</strong></h2>
<p>The move away from Lightning hasn’t added any extra features to the iPad, but has made them more accessible and dare I say it interesting. It is slightly strange to find the port isn’t a Thunderbolt 3 variant, but is still capable of supporting an external display up to 5k.</p>
<p>Having tested several apps it is clear nothing extra stands out but it has allowed me to use my already amassed selection of USB-C cables from my MacBook Pro. Cheaper option for USB-C to HDMI and also dongles mean the dream of not carrying a laptop at all are getting a whole lot closer.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The 2018 iPad has proved to be a worthy upgrade <em><em>for me</em></em>, it has improved on lots of little things that while weren’t detrimental, they where annoying.</p>
<p>With that said Apples recent trend of increasing the price and providing less equipment in the box is getting close to putting me off. All of the iPad’s have increased in price, there is no headphone dongle, no spare Apple Pencil tips and nothing to say Apple wont continue this trend. If asked what iPad should I buy, I would give most users the choice between the £329 iPad and the much cheaper 10.5” iPad pro.</p>
<p>As good as it is, and it really is good, I view this iPad as even a notch above pro. It is the early adopter or hardcore users iPad, not the one for everyone.</p>

<p>For longer than I care to remember, or admit to, I have been searching for the perfect task manager. I am definitely not alone in the feeling that there wasn’t a service that seemed to fit. <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-01-14-todoist-review/">Todoist</a> almost got there, Things 3 is pretty good, but no service ticked all the boxes and I went backwards and forwards between them more than a handful of times. Thankfully I think I’ve cracked it, and it’s an add on service for the stock reminders app – I think Goodtasks3 is the perfect solution.</p>
<p>For almost as long as I’ve been switching task manager apps, Apple’s reminders app has been in desperate need of an overhaul. Everyone admits it, yet it still has a completely different UI to every other app and hasn’t received the level of attention given to Notes or Music. Frankly it isn’t a very good iOS citizen either. Countless third party apps put it to shame, offering a much better service, miles better design and huge improvements in user experience.</p>
<p>Although what Apple reminders lacks in appeal it makes it for in utility, it’s ingrained in almost every part of iOS and allows for much better task input. It just need some so called ‘power user’ options and easer task input. This is where GoodTask 3 comes in. Once granted access to your stock reminders it can be used to sort, display, set up and complete tasks alongside Apple’s own app.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Smart Lists</strong></strong></h2>
<p>One of my favourite functions are smart lists, allowing for filtering into different options based on numerous filters either individually or combined. For example I have set up smart lists to mimick my typical Todoist home screen, with an Inbox, Today overview and others based on reminder topic – Work, Home etc.</p>
<p>GoodTask achieves this by putting text in the title or notes of each reminder. A hashtag or keyword in the task notes doesn’t clog up lists if you choose to also use the Apple app, but allows for much more flexibility in task types. Separating work and home, short and long term goals, whatever you are trying to achieve. Because of how easy task input is I have achieved much more in the last few months.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-11-09-goodtasks3-screenshots-1-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b152a8bfb5.jpg" alt="2018 11 09 goodtasks3 screenshots 1 1" width="1000" height="478" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong><strong>Task Input</strong></strong></h2>
<p>Inputting tasks becomes much easier with quick actions and contextual awareness. This is something really lacking from even advanced task managers like Things 3. Once you have experienced the natural input of Todoist it is really hard to go elsewhere. Tap the plus icon in GoodTask and you can use almost all of the same options. By default it will pick out reminder titles, alert requests and also due dates. Although just bare in mind you will need to delve into settings if you don’t use American date structures.</p>
<p>This is also where quick actions come in, these give the ability to tap on predefined options for task labels, alert options and also adding to shared lists. These can be customised until your heart is content and make GoodTask infinitely more powerful the more work you put in.</p>
<p>All of these options are great, but the real beauty of adopting GoodTask is the fact that all the other options for inputting regular reminders are also open to you. Use Siri on any device and simply ask it to remind you. No keywords, no Shortcuts, no awkward phrasing and nothing to worry about. Tasks will show in the stock app and also GoodTask 3, where you can add in extra details and labelling.</p>
<p>I have adopted a <a href="http://rocketpanda.net/2018/10/gtd-series-intro/">GTD approach</a> and set up an Inbox smart list where every reminder without a due date, or tag ends up. Allowing me to brain dump everything I wish to do, and worry about when and how later on. GoodTask 3 will allow you to get many of the power user features with all of the benefits of a first party app and it is highly recommended.</p>

<p>I could never work out what was so magic about Apple’s Keyboard, nor the mouse to a lesser extent. It didn’t do anything out of the ordinary, didn’t wow me with features and certainly didn’t do any magic, bar make your bank balance smaller. At least the Smart Keyboard was reasonably smart. Not in a literal sense, it didn’t actually learn anything but it looked kind of cool and folded smartly into a neat(ish) package.</p>
<p>The Smart Keyboard for the iPad has gotten quite a lot of stick over the years it has been on the market. It has been trounced for not being back lit, not being wide enough and being a bit ugly. Yet I have a love for it, despite its un-smartness, and it is by far my most used keyboard for the last few years.</p>
<p>Mainly because it so dam straight forward to use. Once attached to the iPad you don’t have to worry about pairing it, charging it, or any other weirdness that always happens with third party keyboards. No settings to delve into, no keys that work on some devices and not others, and you don’t have to deal with micro USB ever again!</p>
<p>With all this said there are some options I would like to see, some dedicated iOS buttons such as media controls, or dam it even a function row. What I don’t want is for Apple to start making the smartkeyboard backlit and ruin its greatest feature – portability.</p>
<p>The new 11” version has already changed into a folio case, with two questionable viewing angels. Whilst it is great to finally cover the back of my iPad it does add more bulk. The Smart keyboard as it stands should always remain the best option for something light and easy to use, but that’s not to stop Apple making other versions. It gets a lot of stick but I enjoy using it daily – a little ode to the not so Smart Keyboard.</p>

<p>I have no issue with sharing myself and my life in person or online. I have a job in sales, I podcast all the time, yet there is something you may not know about me – I am actually really introverted.</p>
<p>Much much less than I used to be, but it seems to be hard for people to wrap their head around it. I am sure many people would label me as much more outgoing than I actually am, and I used to worry about it quite a lot.</p>
<p>I have what I describe as an extrovert battery, and it only lasts so long. I spend <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-10-28-too-much-time-alone/">lots of my time alone</a> preparing for the times I need to be more social. I haven’t quite got the time frame down yet, but when working for long periods or spending lots of time with others, around late afternoon I start to flag.</p>
<blockquote><p>Introverts get their energy by being alone or in small groups, while extroverts get their energy from larger groups of people. – <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147750/social-anxiety-psychology-how-to-be-yourself-ellen-hendriksen-interview">Ellen Hendriksen</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I didn’t even realise this was normal until very recently. I thought introverts were those that shy away from everything and were a little socially awkward. Personality traits are often miss understood like this, but all I know is that I feel drained and often need some quiet time to simply recharge.</p>
<p>I thrive in peace and quiet where I can focus, but love interacting with others and conversing. I’m perfectly happy being the centre of attention, but not for too long and providing I get some down time. I guess I need to look after my little extrovert battery, make sure it goes through it’s charge cycles correctly and preserve its longevity.</p>

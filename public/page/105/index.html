  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Wow, well this adventure into the possibility of using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Things</a> as a replacement for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/todoist-organize-your-life/id572688855?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Todoist</a> is proving fruitful. That is not to say I couldn’t do most of these things in other apps, but the automation seems much more approachable. It also helps that people like Federico at MacStories keep giving me inspiration for more Workflows.  <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/8a204d55398b44a1b7df854b746227c6">This Workflow</a> simplifies one shared with <a href="https://club.macstories.net/">MacStories members</a>, and allows me to quickly add webpages that I want to read later, or ones I want to write about to Things.</p>
<p>It takes Safari webpage links, finds the article title and webpage, prompts for a tag and due date, then puts all of that information into Things for you to look at later. The date can also be input in natural language as <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-03-03-natural-language-dates-in-things/">discussed in an older post</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a1f2bca0b1.jpg" alt="2018 03 04 things article screens 1" title="2018-03-04-things-article-screens-1.png" border="0" width="1000" height="498" />All of the information is then crammed into a URL which might look complicated but is in fact surprisingly easy. Due to the automation features packed into Things 3.4 the URL will open in the Things app and add in your desired todo item. Including article title, website information and of course the URL as a note, so you can pick up where you left off.</p>
<p>This simple Workflow is really easy to customise if you wish. I use one without a due date which can be deleted if you want to. You can also create a list in Things for all of these articles instead of adding a tag. Just change the long URL at the bottom to read <code>&amp;list=</code> instead of <code>&amp;tags=</code>.</p>
<p>There is a whole list of possibilities that you could build into the URL scheme if you want to take a look what Things supports head over to their support page. I will be sharing more <a href="https://gr36.com/workflow">Workflows as and when I build them</a> so follow along.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As you might have <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-02-26-workflow-spark-email-to-things/">gathered already</a> I have been playing around with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Things 3 from Cultured Code</a>. After being a long time <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/todoist-organize-your-life/id572688855?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Todoist</a> user it has taken a little getting used to, but the recent updates have made the app provide almost everything that I am looking for. One major missing piece is natural language processing, and once you have started using things in this way it is hard to go back.</p>
<p>In Todoist you can input tasks by typing as if you were speaking. For example typing into the entry field “Change the air filter next Tuesday at 8am” will add in a task of exactly that instruction. Where as in Things you have to tap through date and time options for a reminder at the desired time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3dd8337253.jpg" alt="2018 03 03 things screenshots 1" title="2018-03-03-things-screenshots-1.png" border="0" width="1000" height="665" />Luckily there is a simple solution, and once again <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Workflow</a> comes to the rescue. If you haven’t used Workflow before, grab the app (its free) and check out a <a href="https://gr36.com/2016-06-27-get-started-workflow/">few hints to get you started</a>.</p>
<p>Workflow has an in built natural language engine so can do all the heavy lifting for you. I have put together a very <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/a7514852104a48498aafe5624b0e468d">simple workflow</a> that will help you along. Grab it from the link above and put it to use, it’s as easy as pie.</p>
<p>The first prompt will ask you for a title for your todo, the second will ask for any notes you wish to ask. Lastly there is a prompt for the date for the reminder. This can process regular dates and also the natural language you desire, convert this into the format Things needs and put it all into the app.</p>
<p>You can customise this as much as you like with tags and projects. For more information on Things URL scheme and automation head over to <a href="https://support.culturedcode.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2803573">their support page</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I am now a little over 3 years with the iPad as my computer and nothing much has really changed. I wrote about one year of using the <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-02-19-one-year-ipad-computer/">iPad Pro as my computer</a> last year but I started with an iPad Air 2 in 2015. Don’t get me wrong, the power of the iPad has improved, the level of apps has taken a huge leap forward and even the OS is easier to use – but in reality things are pretty much as they were.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of articles proposing inprovements that Apple need to make to improve the iPad. Federico Viticci is one of my inspirations for using the iPad and he is no stranger to mocking up <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-11-ipad-wishes-and-concept-video/">videos and making a wish list for iPad</a> improvements. Yet I find myself in a pretty happy place for my usage, writing and being productive is a breeze on iOS. Most of the improvements requested are for small use cases and perhaps this is the point where the changes plateau or Apple chooses to make <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-12-home-screen-changes-pushed-to-2019.2103616/">drastic changes to the UI</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>as great as iOS10 is there are still holes in Apples OS. Thankfully most of these are filled by the rich app ecosystem</p></blockquote>
<p>With the release of iOS11 Apple made an initially confusing but revolutionary change to multi tasking, resulting in much easier interaction. The “holes” that were in iOS10 have mostly been filled by either Apple or applications – and in this third party echo system the real strides are being made. Professional applications are arriving in the iPad all the time, amazingly capable applications such as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/affinity-photo/id1117941080?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Affinity Photo</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/working-copy/id896694807?mt=8&amp;at=100ltj4">Working Copy</a>prove the real strength of the platform.</p>
<p>If rumours are to be believed development looks set to become easier with the introduction of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/12/apple-has-a-plan-for-universal-apps-across-ios-and-macos-report-says/">shared development platform with project Marzipan</a>. This could, as many have pointed out, lead to macOS being inundated with Instagram and Facebook. Yet could just as well lead to powerful Mac apps appearing on iPad. Unfortunately there are downsides, and you can be assured that Adobe won’t conform to a sandbox environment.</p>
<h2>Accessories Made For A Pro</h2>
<p>Adoption of the iPad as a computer is due to many reasons – but they revolve around the powerful hardware, amazing battery life and the ecosystems surrounding it. Despite Apple producing a Pencil and a Smart Keyboard, the innovation has stalled. There are very few accessories that make use of the smart connector featured on the iPad Pro, and third party alternatives are often severely <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&amp;hl=en-gb&amp;ei=Xq6KWofNHIS9gAbQiLG4Dg&amp;q=brydge+keyboard+issues&amp;oq=brydge+keyboard+issues&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-serp.3..0.16214.17708.0.17816.9.9.0.4.4.0.152.869.1j6.7.0....0...1c..64.mobile-gws-serp..2.7.525...0i67k1.152.zSrde3Yxc_U">lacking in quality</a>.</p>
<p>In order to push the iPad Pro into other areas, would further development of accessories be required? The hardware is hugely powerful, yet restricted to typing on a keyboard or writing on the screen. Many people have mused about an iOS laptop – this would be pretty easy to achieve with an open ecosystem. Could Apple allow companies to build a dock for iPad usage on a bigger screen? Could Apple allow interaction with a mouse?</p>
<p>They certainly could do lots of things, but would this provide many more sales of devices? The real progress is to be made in applications, not changing the interaction paradigm completely. When Apple featured the phrase “what’s a computer” in <a href="https://youtu.be/sQB2NjhJHvY">their advert</a> they really meant it. There are so many people now using mobile first devices that the traditional computing interface is becoming less and less relevant. There are still things that are far easier to use a keyboard and mouse for, but these things are decreasing all the time.</p>
<p>Leaning the iPad back to a desktop computing model serves no purpose other than complicating matters. The iPad in 2018 should continue down the path it already sets out, the future of computing is coming into sight in a mobile device world. I am amazingly happy with everything the iPad can do for me – long may it continue.</p>

<p>The HomePod itself it deceptively small, but surprisingly heavy. It comes boxed in the usual Apple style – paying particular attention to the experience of sliding off the top and uncovering the HomePod it all its glory. Bar the device itself there is little else in the box apart from a small information card and a single Apple logo sticker.</p>
<p>Particular attention has been paid towards the power cable. The braided cord fitted to the HomePod is not detachable, some seem to think this is user hostile, however you are not likely to be unplugging the unit very often. Should damage occur to the cable, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/10/16999372/apple-homepod-repair-damaged-cable-pricing">repair will cost you $29</a>. Which is reasonable given that dropping the HomePod itself could <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/9/16994974/homepod-repair-price-applecare-warranty">prove very costly</a>.</p>
<h2>Set Up</h2>
<p>Many people have raved about how easy the set up is for HomePod, as it expands on the same process as with any W1 powered device. Simply power the unit on, and nearby devices will be prompted with a set up card at the bottom of the screen. You <em>will</em> need an iOS device running iOS11 to do this, be it an iPhone or iPad, but did you really expect anything else.</p>
<p>My set up was slightly more complicated, at first try I was greeted with the blank card that has plagued many users. The cause of this hasn’t been established, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArP9SOz9CUI&amp;feature=youtu.be">although seems to be linked to the iPhone X</a>, but I was able to complete on the second attempt by simply powering off the HomePod and back on again.</p>
<p>Pay special attention to these set up screens, because if like me you are using the device for the family. Enabling private information will mean anybody can instruct the HomePod to read out messages and even reply to them. This is pretty transparent in the set up process, but sometime excitement takes over and you simply accept any prompts given you.</p>
<h2>Sound</h2>
<p>The HomePod is first and foremost a speaker, Apple clearly wanted to produce a great sounding device to consume music on. They have been on and off developing the device for a number of years, and the results speak for themselves. I am by no means an audio guru, but the HomePod sounds great wherever you are in the room, and when compared to the many Sonos speakers I have it is noticeably better.</p>
<p>That is not to say that is head a shoulders above everything else. Podcasts and audio books do not sound as good as they do on other devices, but for Music the sound is much more powerful and richer than many other devices. I have noticed sounds in songs that I have listened to lots of times purely from the HomePod audio range. The Verge did a great comparison video on a range of devices and mirrors pretty much my own findings.</p>
<h2>Siri</h2>
<p>Apples ‘smart’ assistant gets a lot of stick, and rightly so. It is considered well behind both Google and Amazon in terms of ability and also parsing information. You will find no arguments here, Apple have a serious issue with being left behind and the HomePod does not help their argument.</p>
<p>If anything it is further evidence of the lack of development that the very first voice assistant has had since being released alongside the iPhone 4s. With that said I have not had any trouble with Siri hearing my commands, even above loud music, and they have pretty much been spot on. Siri is not smart, but it does do a good job of doing basic things reliably. Simple questions such as weather, commanding smart home equipment and sports scores are no issue, but as many people have already commented on, you wont find any abilities outside of Apples own services.</p>
<p>Music is its strength and will often find the correct track with limited information. I have confidence that the HomePod <em>could</em> become an extremely capable device given the computing power inside. However this potential needs to be developed by Apple during a time when software is not its strong point. Siri on the HomePod could become a make or break device, and it is ultimately Apples privacy stance that is holding Siri back. Post CES it is clear that Amazon and particularly Google are pushing their digital assistants as a platform rather than something as a side bar to a mobile OS.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I was dead set on returning the HomePod after I had played around with it. My Sonos speakers have been one of the best devices I have spent money on, and I found it hard to believe they could be replaced.</p>
<p>However given a very small time with the HomePod both myself and <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/962050054541295618">the family</a> have been converted. The device has already replaced two Sonos Play:1 speakers upstairs and I will more than likely buy another to replace a Play:3 downstairs in time. This is said with a little resistance, as the HomePod only exists to keep iOS users in the ecosystem and gain Apple Music subscribers. Yes Spotify works in a round about way, but the experience is much better with Apple Music.</p>
<p>Although the smart aspects of the HomePod leaves a lot to be desired, so does using Alexa with my Sonos speakers. There <em>are</em> a lot of features that I feel are missing from the device to make every user happy, however for me the device is more than capable of doing what I require. Apple really needs to pull out all the stops this WWDC and introduce many platform changes to Siri for risk of being even further behind.</p>
<p>The HomePod is fine for me, but may not be enough if you are looking for an assistant rather than simply great sound. Siri, although very capable, feels like an afterthought and won’t please everyone.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2018/01/20/how-to-build.html"><h1 class="p-name">How To Build A Micro Blog On Jekyll</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>After exploring other options to sharing on social media and <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-01-20-using-microblog/">using Micro.blog</a> I’m stuck. There doesn’t seem to be the perfect option out there to fulfil all of my needs so for now I still to my own blog.</p>
<p>Now comes the issues with posting lots of updates and where they need to go. Ultimately there are a few things I want to achieve.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping content mine as much as possible</li>
<li>post to other social media platforms</li>
<li>not clog up longer blog post streams or RSS</li>
</ul>
<p>Since my blog is already built on Jekyll and hosted on Github I set to work to hit as many of these goals as possible.</p>
<h2><strong>Keep content mine</strong></h2>
<p>The main feature of my <a href="/">micro.blog usage was for Daring Fireball style link posts</a>. Short quotes from other peoples articles (linking back to them) and a few words (sub 150) from my self as a comment. I built a Workflow to do this easily on micro.blog so sharing these shouldn’t be a major issue.</p>
<h3><strong>Micro Blog Collection</strong></h3>
<p>Inside your _config.yml set up a collection with a name of your choice. Seeing as this will be aimed at micro blog I went for something easy.</p>
<pre><code>Collections:
micro:
 output: true
 permalink: /micro/:title
</code></pre>
<p>This will mean that posts in this collection will not be posted to the main index page and also not in the main RSS feed. Create a folder called _micro for all the micro posts to go into.</p>
<h3><strong>Micro Blog Index</strong></h3>
<p>In the main repo create a file called micro.html and set the YAML with a permalink as /micro/index.html. Example below:</p>
<pre><code>—
permalink: permalink: /link/index.html</code></pre>
<h2 id="title:linkposts">title: Link Posts</h2>
<p>Then it’s time to get all of your posts listed, this is pretty easy to do and will ultimately be dictated by what info you will want to see on an index page, the below is the contents of mine. This page will then be found at /micro/.</p>
<pre><code>{ % for item in site.micro reversed % }</code></pre>
<article class="post-preview">  { % if item.link % }
 <a>
  </a>
<h2> </h2>
<a>
  </a>   { % else %}   
<h2> </h2>
{ % endif % }   
<p> </p>
</article>
<pre><code>
{ % endfor % }
</code></pre>
<p>I have chosen to only show the title and then all of the content as these will only be small posts. The If item.link is unique to my use case and means that if I set a link in my YMAL front matter the title will link to this URL in a similar vein to Daring Fireball.</p>
<p>The</p>
<article>tag is set in my CSS and simply adds in the same formatting as my blog and separates the posts neatly.
<p>If in doubt copy the content from your index.html and add in <code>{ % for item in site.micro reversed % }</code>.</p>
<h3><strong>Micro Blog RSS Feed</strong></h3>
<p>This might come as a shock but if you’ve got a regular blog people won’t want to read a barrage of micro updates. So a collection and separate RSS feed is a must. This is the easiest part of the set up. Simply create a file called micro.xml and add the following:</p>
<pre><code>—</code></pre>
</article>
<p>  Hello Friends https://gr36.com</p>
<pre><code>{ % for post in site.micro reversed % }
<pre><code>&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;




https://gr36.com
https://gr36.com
</code></pre>
<p>{ % endfor % }
</code></pre></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>All of your posts in the Micro collection will now be delivered through this separate RSS feed. So you can set this to post to social media through IFTTT or many other places as you desire however there are limitations.</p>
<h2><strong>Cross Posting</strong></h2>
<p>This is where I fall down. I haven’t found a way to share full posts that are below 280 characters straight to twitter and longer ones as links. I am pretty sure this is achievable however I stopped short when realising almost every one of my posts was way past this limit.</p>
<p>I believe there may be a way to do this with a limited RSS of 280 characters. However in practice this hasn’t worked for me to auto post through IFTTT. If this is a major issue for you then micro.blog is the place for you!</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps with improving your Jekyll site and can be modified to your use cases for collections. I am currently adapting this to add in a few collections so the possibilities are endless.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>So. Deep breath and we will begin my attempt to leave Twitter and still be social. Timothy Smith summed this up perfectly when talking about micro blog by saying “I wanted to get away from Twitter. If you don’t get why, that’s ok”. For my attempt I decided that I needed something that would still allow me to share blog posts and BYOD podcast episodes, but keep me away from the cesspool that is Twitter. I just hadn’t decided what this was yet, and Micro.blog seemed my best bet.</p>
<p>I instantly gelled with much of their platform, both <a href="https://gr36.com/link/">not worrying about numbers</a> and the <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE ethos</a>. This isn’t the first time I have contemplated the worry of owning all of my content. I moved to my own blog for my writing, but this also branches out to Twitter and Facebook. I’m not an artist that relies on their social media for income, but if the service dies one day I’d be pretty annoyed all my tweets disappeared. That is where Micro.blog comes in or in the IndieWebCamp’s POSSE approach : publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere.</p>
<p>You have all of your content on your own website, and it posts to other services of your choice inside their own restrictions. For example posts over 280 characters need to be truncated for Twitter. Micro.blog has the added benefit of no follower count, no stats and none of the associated stress. The creator Manton Reece specific left out these things so there is no influence and no popularity contest.</p>
<h2>To The Micro Blogs!</h2>
<p>For a long time the platform was invite only, with Kickstarter backers getting first dibs on user names. However sign ups are now open and you can be sending micro blog updates in a few minutes. The platform is really easy to get to grips with, although there are in-depth settings to customise the look of your blog and where your posts will appear.</p>
<p>There are already loads of people using Micro.blog to post updates, however they are not easily discoverable. There is a ‘Discover’ tab but this tends to be the same or similar people. Unless people point you to their account or are mentioned by others it is extremely difficult to find them. With that said the platform is less about consuming and more about posting. With the no follower count ethos they have neglected ease of engagement. If users cant find others with similar interests or even contrasting once then engagement is stuck.</p>
<p>With that said the small team of developers are adding in new features all the time. They have avoided the #hashtag and are using Emoji for search instead. The tester is for books, however new ones are planned once usage is established.</p>
<p>The small team of developers has a massive advantage with the fact they can move fast and adapt very quickly. It is very early days for the new platform so new features are coming thick and fast. The small team also offers exceptional support with issues, I even got a personal response from the creator!</p>
<h2>Using the app</h2>
<p>Unfortunately there is a downside to only being a very small team, and the quality starts to show when using the iOS apps. This is not the selling point of microblog and perhaps if more apps supported the API (looking at you Ulysses) then arguably the app wouldn’t even be needed. Although it looks terrible everything works and works well.</p>
<p>There is loads of white, or grey, space and I have no doubt these spaces will have things fill it in the near future. The service is still pretty new and the whole point is getting you in charge of your content, so is mainly web based. There are a few other apps that support posting to Micro.blog so some of them may be better suited to your needs.</p>
<h2>URL Support</h2>
<p>Information on URL support is very thin on the ground, there is no official documentation although there is an open API.</p>
<p>I stumbled across the callback URL for posting by accident when searching for Workflow examples. To open straight into the app the following can be used.</p>
<p><code>microblog://post?text= </code></p>
<p>So you can append test to these to open straight into the app ready for posting. It would be pretty easy to put together Workflows to aid in this, I created a <a href="http://gr36.micro.blog/2018/01/06/workflows-for-microblog.html">couple and shared them on my micro.blog</a>.</p>
<h2>Cross Posting</h2>
<blockquote><p>We believe in the IndieWebCamp’s POSSE approach : publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere. Some of the advantages they list for cross-posting include owning your content, reducing third-party dependencies, canonical URLs, and better search. – Micro Blog</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of the things lacking if I tried to build my own personal ‘thing’ that cross posted. I <a href="https://brightlycolored.org/2017/02/creating-a-microblog-with-jekyll/">still cant work out</a> how to post things less than 280 characters directly to Twitter and turn longer posts into a linked blog post. Micro.blog does this perfectly, allowing you to write exactly what you feel. Small posts are transferred straight to Twitter and/or Facebook and longer posts are truncated and linked to.</p>
<p>It’s as if you were posting things directly to Twitter, except your not. Major plus that you don’t loose yourself in posts from others, but a major downside if others try and engage with you. This was one of the reasons I finally deleted my Facebook account because leaving a ‘ghost’ account is perhaps not the best practice.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So in reality you end up using both apps, and it doesn’t give you the freedom you may seek. Micro.blog is less a freedom from social media as hinted at, but more about content ownership. Which is the smaller of the two concerns if I had to rank them.</p>
<p>The platform shows great potential with more apps adding support for sharing and reading all the time. The small development has its downfalls with app polish, but makes up for it in brilliant support and emails answered almost straight away. New features are being added all the time so I’m definitely going to keep my eye on it. I’ve eased myself back into Twitter in the mean time.</p>

<p>Apple <a href="https://www.imore.com/why-apple-slows-down-old-iphone-models">didn’t apologise</a> for slowing your phone down. Not because of arrogance, not because they don’t care, but because they really didn’t have to. A phone getting slower over time is really not the issue here, the issue is transparency and communication (and perhaps a little bit of urban legend).</p>
<p>As each new operating system upgrade hits devices, the belief is that older devices become unusable to force you to upgrade your device. It’s a tale that doesn’t need to be true, because it is already believed by the masses. Planned obsolescence is a phrase routed in marketing but popularised in modern day through Apple devices. The general consensus is that through Systemic Obsolescence or prevention of repairs, the company pushes you to abandon older devices and purchase a new one.</p>
<p>In fact it doesn’t matter in what way they do it, but to maintain growth they must push users to upgrade. So when Apple first confirmed it slowed down older device with degrading battery performance, and then<a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/">apologised for it lack of communication</a>, many people took this as a conformation of what they already believed to be true.</p>
<p>The truth is Apple did this to maximise the battery life users will get from their phone. Smaller capacity batteries and an optimised OS only goes so far. As the battery degrades the capacity shrinks even more, it happens to every phone but most others have much bigger batteries to start with. Unfortunately not communicating that the OS was doing this to aid the user have come back and bitten Apple – Hard.</p>
<p>This is an issue that will run deeper that the tech press and more savvy users. It is one that has already bleed into the mainstream media, and no doubt into the purchasing decisions of average consumers. I wonder how many people will have that feeling at the back of their mind that Apple might slow down their phones. The tech sphere know the reasons, and most seem to understand why they do it. However slowness really isn’t the issue.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">

<p>You will often find me spending far too much money on productivity apps, but I have another love. Cases are another thing I am never happy with, always looking for the new thing that will keep my pride and joy safe.</p>
<p>Finding the balance point between protecting your phone, but also not adding too much weight or bulk is a difficult choice. Whilst the <a href="/post/2017-11-08-iphonex-impressions/">iPhone X is great</a> and gives me a nice big screen to use one handed, it is heavier than previous models, so adding the official case has bumped the weight up to almost the tipping point.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-12-28-Lopie-seaisland-inside-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/281238dd84.jpg" alt="2017 12 28 Lopie seaisland inside 1" width="600" height="300" border="0" /></p>
<p>When my phone took a <a href="/post/2017-08-20-careful-with-my-phone/">tumble earlier this year</a> it survived only because of the official leather case. Others would have provided it with similar protection, but it has made me so fearful of a similar accident with my £1000 purchase. I just <a href="/post/2017-11-04-few-hours-naked/">can’t use it naked for very long</a>. So ever in search of something new I ordered the Lopie Sea Island Corton Series case and here is my quick review.</p>
<p>The only reason I ordered this model is because the Verge adorning it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16744278/apple-iphone-x-leather-case">the best leather case</a>, and for £15 I figured why not try it. I wasn’t quite banking on an estimated delivery of 20–25 days though! Thankfully it arrived after 20, well packaged and made of great quality materials. The Lopie Sea Island Corton Series case is covered by a combination of a tweed like material at the top and a leather at the bottom. My particular version is light brown.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-12-28-Lopie-seaisland-camera-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/42f5e7f477.jpg" alt="2017 12 28 Lopie seaisland camera 1" width="600" height="300" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>Case Pouch</strong></h2>
<p>I’m not a fan of keeping bank cards, or any other type of card for that matter tucked in the back of my phone. Some people use their case as a faux wallet and store everything in there. However great this seems in practice, it can be extremely annoying when you want to actually use the phone.</p>
<p>This for me is the only sticking point of a great case – there is a card slot in the back of the phone. Where material meets leather, for some reason Lopie made it a pocket. However I have never tucked a card in there, and never will. The small gap is barely noticeable and I struggle to get a finger nail in there to prise it open. Should you wish to use it to store a card or two, I have no doubt the leather will stretch to accommodate this. However once this is done, there is no going back, it will be a pocket forever.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-12-28-Lopie-seaisland-buttons-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a0e50da76d.jpg" alt="2017 12 28 Lopie seaisland buttons 1" width="600" height="300" border="0" /></p>
<h1><strong>Feel</strong></h1>
<p>The pouch does mean that there is a difference in height of the two materials. When handling the phone, you will notice a ‘lip’ that takes a little getting used to when compared to standard staple cases. For the last couple of years I have settled into moving backwards and forwards between an Apple Leather case, and also an Apple silicone case. So having any difference in texture felt strange to start but an easy enough compromise.</p>
<p>The leather strangely ads a certain slippery feel when compared to the grip of the material at the top. However I have every confidence the leather will age well, and some doubts that the top of the case will do the same. The case will provide a good level of drop protection but the material will definitely suffer should it happen outside.</p>
<p>The designers have offset the grey fabric against extremely tactile if a little garish buttons. They compliment the colouring of the leather reasonably well, however highlighted handset buttons seem to be the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/lets-talk-about-that-pixel-2-contrast-color-button-though/">in look at the moment</a>. With that said they are sturdy and offer reassuring clicks when pressed, something missing from most cases around this price point.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>This is a great case for the price point. It offers luxury akin to the official Apple cases but at a fraction of the price. It will take a while to get to you, but it is definitely worth the wait. The attention to detail on the buttons and also the second sim and ejection tool pocket found inside the case, all lead me to believe in the workmanship gone into the Lopie Sea Island Corton Series case.</p>
<p>More than anything, this case has made me realise how much I would love a case made of the fabric material. Google did a great job with the Pixel case, and I’m hoping someone will make one in the very near future. However this case is one of the best I have tried.

<p>I can feel it once again, the stirs of urges that are controlling my habits without any conscious thought. All the billions poured into research and development, all the hours of design and engineering are working. All simply to keep me picking up the computer in my pocket.</p>
<p>Although many claim these issues do not exist, I can tell you for a fact they do and I can feel it once more. The word addiction stirs up some powerful emotions. The thought of smartphone addiction brings with it the notion of someone weak that is simply not strong enough to put down the handset. It labels those as a sub class, with overtones of snark. Yet we are ALL those addicts.</p>
<p>Any moment of boredom and the hand reaches into the pocket and out comes the warm glow of pixels and hits of dopamine. For the last few months I have been aware of these effects, consciously fighting these feelings of behavioural addiction. It is only once you stop doing what is almost normal you can observe the behaviour of others around you. Much as a ex-drug addict can observe minute clues in those still fighting addiction, I can not only see the changes in others, but in myself.</p>
<blockquote><p>Recent studies suggest the most compulsive behaviour we engage in has to do with cyber connectivity; 40% of us have some sort of internet-based addiction — whether it’s checking your email (on average workers check it 36 times an hour), mindlessly scrolling through other people’s breakfasts on Instagram or gambling online. — Fatima Bhutto, The guardian.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since purchasing the iPhone X, I have been using my phone much more then I want to. I can feel the itch that others must feel. In order to justify my expensive purchase, and as well as enjoying a new purchase, I have been using it much more than previous phones. With thanks to unethical app design and a gloriously immersive screen, the behavioural addiction has returned.</p>
<p>I find myself reaching for my phone when I have no need to. The itch returns at ridiculous times and requires conscious thought to stop. My mind is simply reliant on having something to entertain me, even when there are many other options. I am not some weak minded person to be dismissed, although I feel that way. The only reason I feel these things is because I have broken the cycle once before. I must do again, and so should you.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>I’ve been toying with the idea of journaling for a long time. I’ve started jotting things down several times, but never really got the hang of it. Although I liked the idea of having a <a href="https://medium.com/p/23f1d1c23df5?source=linkShare-fa062289c217-1512807706">physical diary of my thoughts</a>, I was always worried it wouldn’t stay personal. So a digital version seemed like the only way and thats where Day One comes it. Helping me to journal as much as I like keeping it safe and secure.</p>
<p>The version in current use is actually the second iteration by developer <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/day-one-journal/id1044867788?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Bloom Built</a>. Even this iteration has existed since 2016, so this is not a new app or service. Many users have been on a <a href="https://twitter.com/ljrain/status/931876494325972992">steak for years</a>, and the app is constantly being improved and updated. I’ve been using it on and off for 3 years to store some thoughts, as well as setting up IFTTT recipes to capture <a href="https://ifttt.com/applets/395684p">my Instagram</a>and blog posts. However over the past few weeks I’ve been using it daily to capture my thoughts and feelings to much benefit to my mental health.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-12-09-day-One-mockups-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/923899ceee.jpg" alt="2017 12 09 day One mockups 1" width="600" height="399" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>Using the app</strong></h2>
<p>The design of the app is extremely easy to understand and dare I say it very pleasing to use. If you wish to make an entry simply tap on the cross in the main area or at the bottom of your entry list. The icons at the bottom of the screen are a little confusing, from left to right you have the option to quickly change journal (you need a plus or greater to do this), filter image moats, make an entry, show the locations of your posts or bring up a large calendar.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of these they become natural but certainly could be be more clear. For example you can also change journal in the top left of the main screen, so why you need two options is unclear. However a small UI confusion can be forgive because the rest of the interface is very clear and easy to use. Tap either cross to make a post and begin your journaling journey.</p>
<p>In the entry screen you can add in text formatted as you desire with headings and other styling. You can also add in photos already taken or capture you own straight from the app. Many other apps I have tried prioritise text entires above anything else, but with Day One I have clipped in images that have caught my eye, and many that have displayed my current feelings in an image. If I simply want to enter a location for me to expand on later, I can open the Apple Watch app to drop a pin or dictate a quick entry.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-12-12-dayone-watch-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/33190ec48c.jpg" alt="2017 12 12 dayone watch 1" width="1400" height="369" border="0" />If you wish to post your entries to other platforms such as a blog there are several export options through the share sheet.</p>
<p>Those wishing to capture every inch of their lives can also automatically add locations, current weather, tags and even your activity data to journal entries. Don’t worry if this is too much information for you to give up because not only is syncing encrypted between devices (Premium required), you can also secure the app with passcode or TouchID/FaceID.</p>
<h2><strong>Price</strong></h2>
<p>Day One has adopted the subscription payment model that causes so much divide in opinion. I purchased the app before this move so I get a slightly different level but for new customers you have a choice of level.</p>
<p>The App is completely free to download and use. You can journal away and never pay a penny. With the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>One journal</li>
<li>One photo per entry</li>
<li>Unlimited entries</li>
<li>Local backups (including iCloud device backups)</li>
<li>Exporting (PDF, JSON, Plain Text)</li>
<li>Book Printing</li>
<li>Activity Feed (iOS)</li>
<li>Maintenance and non-Premium updates as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can then upgrade should they wish to add in extra features. This costs $34.99 USD/year or $3.99 USD/month. For this price on top of the free features you shall receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited journals</li>
<li>30 photos per entry</li>
<li>Mac app with Premium features</li>
<li>Unlimited syncing with Day One Sync</li>
<li>End-to-end encryption with Day One Sync</li>
<li>Discount on book printing (currently available in US only)</li>
<li>IFTTT integration</li>
<li>Access to Day One Web (beta) and Android (when released)</li>
<li>Future access to Premium features like audio recording, writing prompts, video entries, additional photos per entry, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although a subscription service <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/29/day-one-app-now-a-subscription-service/">always proves to be controversial</a>, most users simply do not need to pay anything. Day One offers fantastic value for money for those wanting to get started. Users can to dive straight in and start filling in a journal with unlimited entries including one photo for free. Only if you require multiple journals, syncing, or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/day-one/id1055511498?mt=12&amp;at=1000ltj4">access to the Mac app</a> will you need to spend any money. Providing that you use iCloud backups when you get a new device, you won’t even need to worry about syncing to the cloud.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-12-12-Dayonemacapp-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/85c5343f34.jpg" alt="2017 12 12 Dayonemacapp 1" width="800" height="500" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>URL Support</strong></h2>
<p>Day One has great support for third party API use and also URL schemes for new entries and opening into specific areas.</p>
<p>Create Entry with Text <code>dayone://post?entry=</code> Create Entry with Tags: <code>dayone://post?entry=Hello Self&amp;tags=My Tag, Test</code> Create Entry in Journal: <code>dayone://post?entry=Hello Self&amp;journal=Day One</code> Create Entry with Clipboard Image: <code>dayone://post?entry=Hello Self&amp;imageClipboard=1</code></p>
<p>This will allow you to use use shortcuts in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/launcher-with-multiple-widgets/id905099592?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Launcher</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Launch Centre Pro</a>. <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/2016/03/day-one-ifttt/">IFTTT support</a> requires the paid upgrade, however the API only works as a write API, there is no read API. So support is limited to ‘THAT’ rather than universal usage. I have asked Day One for <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/939461078471335936">expanded support</a>, and it isn’t on their roadmap as yet.</p>
<p>There are also a wide range of tools available for Day One, ranging from <a href="https://github.com/underscorephil/todoist_dayone">Todoist scripts</a> to importing entries from other apps. So you really can dig in and make Day One the centre of <a href="https://intercom.help/dayone/day-one-2-0/day-one-tools">your daily routine</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>In contrast to every other <a href="/tags/app/">app I have reviewed in the past</a>, the conclusion for this app split into two areas. The benefits of Journaling regularly have paid off on my mental health, and allowed me to write down the way I am feeling without the worry of those feelings being exposed to anyone else but me. There is also the conclusion of using the app itself.</p>
<p>Day one provides the opportunity for you to use the app completely free of charge and reap the benefits. I have used other Journaling options and dismissed them straight away due to ease of use. There are no such issue with Day One, the app is really easy to use, and is very well designed for the most part. If you want to start journaling, look no further than the Day One.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As I slowly split my life into different sections, and live a life with different apps for home and work – <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Things 3</a> has become vitally important. It takes a more relaxed approach than <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-01-14-todoist-review/">Todoist</a> and allows me to remember things to do but not feel stressed about them.</p>
<p>So I’ve put together a simple <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Workflow</a> to place a list of items I need into a checklist in Things 3. This can be launched from the Today widget so you can type in all the items, just tap return between them. Or more often than not my wife will text me a list or put it in a shared Apple Note, I can simply highlight the list and share it to the Workflow.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/07e225d2ec.jpg" alt="2018 05 15 shoppinglist workflow 1" title="2018-05-15-shoppinglist-workflow-1.png" border="0" width="1000" height="665" /><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/24351a82ce444f318812c0b134f73480">Download the Workflow</a></p>
<p>After typing in which shop you’re going to the Workflow creates a checklist in Things to mark off once you’re there. Such is the power of Workflow and also the brilliant automation features of Things this simple base can also be easily adapted for a list of whatever you need to do, such as a project checklist or DIY tasks list.</p>
<p>All you need to do is change the question in the ask for input action where it says “where are you going” to a more relevant question for the list you wish to make.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://gr36.com/workflows">some of my other Workflows</a> I have shared over time, these are steadily increasing as I find and make more. If you need any help or want to try and achieve something with Workflow <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/workflow/">head over to the subreddit</a> and ask away.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Believe it or not it was Google I/O keynote yesterday! I completely missed this until the event was on, not sure if it is publicised less or I take less of an interest now. Even so Google put all of their eggs in the AI basket and also demonstrated loads of updates to Android. Throw in a few self driving cars for good measure, but most controversially Google Assistant voice capabilities.</p><p>The demo of <a href="https://thenextweb.com/google/2018/05/10/googles-duplex-voice-bot-is-clever-but-im-probably-never-going-to-use-it/">Google Duplex</a> lead to initial amazement, lots of worry about AI and then the inevitable backlash. Most notability of which on this weeks <a href="http://pca.st/episode/e0480447-a19f-4a4d-90dd-0d275432cbdb">Connected podcast</a> the technology was completely ripped apart. Not just a little bit, but completely dismissed as not needed and pointless. The service is indeed initially very creepy but this is indicative of a lot of tech commentators – they completely miss the accessibility angle.</p><p>It shouldn’t even really be referred to as an angle, accessibility should be front and centre of everything. I don’t expect every person to understand what technology such as this can do to people with a disability, but people need to start considering others. It doesn’t take a genius to realise that a service such as this could revolutionise the lives of those with communication issues. Not simply for those that are mute, but a whole range of speech impediments completely remove the possibility to use the telephone. Yet Google are working on the ability for voice communication to be done entirely autonomously – current systems are very expensive, clunky to use or rely on preprogrammed responses.</p><p>I do agree that perhaps the person on the other end should be informed, but if Google know everything about you they might be able to make a pretty good replacement anyway!</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It has been a while since I have been genuinely excited to dive into a new app. After my initial trepidation, and following the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/">massive buzz</a> around the 5th instalment of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Drafts app</a>, I <a href="/2018/04/21/drafts-updatei-must.html">decided to give it a chance</a> and I am so glad I did.</p><p>I have tried Drafts 4 a few times when interesting things come up, these things more often than not involve <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">Viticci</a> et al discussing it’s merits. Yet for some reason I just never really ‘got it’ – it is a powerful enough app but I couldn’t find a use case for it when compared to <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-08-02-bear-and-ulysses/">Ulysses</a> or <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-01-19-bear-app-review/">Bear</a>. After only a few hours of really using the app, and intensifying after a few days, I went though a transition that has affected my relationship with writing text altogether.</p><p>By using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Drafts</a> I no longer need to decide where the text I wish to write needs to go. Drafts has become a place for notes, reminders, blog posts and everything in between. All powered by the single biggest selling point of this app – Actions.</p><p>By building up an arsenal of actions I can now place any text I need to type down where I need it to go. Whereas previously before typing any text in I had to decide if it was a note, blog post, tweet – whatever it was – I had to spend brain power deciding where to put it. Things I need to remember when talking to someone, blog post ideas, long emails I’m mulling over, absolutely everything goes into drafts to be distributed later on.</p><p>The <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/">actions directory</a> has provided me with a whole range of abilities, or inspiration to write my own, integrating with a huge range of services. I have an action to <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1EN">create a Todoist item</a>, post to <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Dj">micro blog</a>, place the <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1GO">front matter into my post and save to my github</a>, and loads more. If I start a blog post now and it doesn’t quite make the mark I can post it to microblog instead. Or a short link post might turn into a full on post, I don’t need different apps doing different things any longer.</p><p>Drafts has enabled me to publish much more just by simplifying my workflow. Add this to the brilliant markdown keyboard functions, fast and fluid app and much better design, I am so happy I gave Drafts a chance. Grab it <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">from the app store</a> and find a use case for it, it might just change your outlook.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Every so often we have a paying for apps debate, sparked off by a popular app releasing an update or <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-09-04-ulysses-subscritpions/">changing income model</a> – and here we are again. Drafts 5 <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/">launches to quite a bit of fun fair from reviewers</a> and also some backlash from users. Time and time again you hear “I won’t pay for app subscriptions”.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Its a terrible business model, that I don’t agree with”</p></blockquote>
<p>Since Apple expanded the subscription model, quite a few apps have adopted the option of charging a small monthly fee or yearly price. Usually giving users the option of a free tier and only paying for more advanced features. These usually come in the form of syncing or hosting, in the case of Drafts it is pro features such as themes and <a href="http://getdrafts.com/actions/">actions</a>. It doesn’t matter what features you get for the price it never quite satisfies the resistance.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> surprising is more often that not when questioned, the retort is one with quite a few logical holes. Quite a common one is the fact users would rather pay for a version upgrade. Which is a pretty easy fix, simply change the way you think about the subscriptions.</p>
<p>Think of the yearly price as purchasing this version with free upgrades. If it gets to the end of that period, either pay again or choose something else. Subscriptions aren’t for every user, nor every app on your phone. No one wants to pay micro payments for every app, but the ones that really aid your life deserve funding. What’s the alternative, poor quality free apps? Adverts that harvest user data and break up design or usage?</p>
<p>By paying money towards an app you aid development greatly you create a constant stream of funding to pay for regular updates and improvements. So in the long run you generally get many more updates than the usual single pay to use apps. It’s a win win situation – just change the way you view them.</p>

<p>There appears to be some confusion around what copying is. Couple this with the argument breaking down into an inevitable Android vs iOS debate and Twitter has been exceptionally noisy today.</p>
<p>Gruber, although a little confused, got the final thoughts in his reply to an <a title="earlier blog post" href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/04/on_normalizing_ripoffs">earlier blog post</a> spot on with:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you write an article, and then I write my own article about the same topic, that just means you were first. But if I copy your article and just change a few words, that’s plagiarism. There’s a big difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is a little late to these comments as I’ve already <a title="shared many of my thoughts" href="https://gr36.com/2018-04-02-copying-the-notch/">shared many of my thoughts</a> but there is no denying the trend is getting worse. Unfortunately there is a lot of fanboy going on in both this and other <a title="surrounding posts" href="https://www.imore.com/where-samsung-shaped-dent-universe?amp#click=https://t.co/fcbbrKarTd">surrounding posts</a> meaning some people are going to switch off very early. As with many things in the Apple verse you have to cut through all this to see the points made about design copying.</p>
<p>There is a massive difference between implementing a feature that another company launched first into your product, or straight up copying it. There exists a theoretical spectrum of ‘inspiration’ — ranging from <a title="Huawei copying software and hardware" href="https://gr36.com/2018-04-02-copying-the-notch/">Huawei copying software</a> and hardware almost pixel for pixel, and <a title="Android taking inspiration from iOS" href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3268870/android/android-p-iphone-x-imitation-innovation.html">Android taking inspiration from iOS</a>. Undoubtedly there is a completely different response to designing features inspired by others, and simply wedging them in.</p>
<p>Only a consumer can decide where they are comfortable sitting on the spectrum and no amount of tech blog commentary will change that. Chinese manufacturers have been doing this for years and customers are still voting with their wallets.</p>
<p>With that said, you cannot point fingers at others and deny Apple doesn’t do similar things. It may not be as blatant as Chinese OEM rips offs, but there is no denying features like the notification centre didn’t require much courage to design. Samsung seems to have changed their previous ways and are now launching industry leading product design, but even they have the occasional slip back into old ways. Companies are all the same so enough with the denial.</p>
<p>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but copying should be offensive to the consumer.</p>

<p>Right from the off the Apple Watch got a tremendous amount of negative reaction. Reviewers said it was under powered, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review">looked strange</a> and the OS felt like a confusing mess. Some had valid points about watchOS, and ever since Apple have been stripping away parts to make it more cohesive. Yet the hate for the ‘honeycomb’ layout app grid remains – but I like it.</p>
<p>There is no denying that the original watchOS was confused and full of half baked ideas. However as time has progressed Apple have zoned in on notifications and health as the selling points. Working hard to streamline the OS and make apps load faster. In watchOS4 Apple allowed users to switch to an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/07/how-to-switch-between-list-view-and-honeycomb-app-grid-on-apple-watch-with-watchos-4/">alphabetic list of apps instead</a>, which many uses immediately did. However in my honest opinion this layout takes much longer the get to the apps you need.</p>
<p>The honeycomb allows you to quickly find the app you need and tap straight on it. All the icons are familiar because they are the same ones we stare at each day using our phone. By presenting them on one screen the speed of selecting an app is much quicker than scrolling a long list of apps in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Perhaps the much larger issue is the fact that many of the stock app icons are too similar and easily confused. The timer and stopwatch ones are strikingly similar but still immediately obvious which app is which. With a little work on customising the layout you can have something familiar, easy to access and useful immediately accessible by just pressing the crown.</p>
<p>Couple this with finally app makers realising that not <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17191408/instagram-apple-watch-app-dead">every platform needs an accompanying watchOS app</a>, and the future looks extremely bright (and light) for Apples most personal device. Embrace the honeycomb, don’t scroll through lists to find the app you need, because scrolling down to Workouts is a chore in itself.</p>

<p>Over the past few years I have been writing on and off for several websites. Some small, some slightly bigger, never successfully but I enjoyed it all the same. I flirted with writing if you will. During this time I never really cared about my words, I never really gave a second thought to what happens to them in a few years, but I have noticed a trend of taking others words and putting someone else’s name on them.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the websites I have posted to have closed down now. Unmaintainable in an externally crowded internet and squeezed monetisation options. Some are just relics, still active but no longer updated. Some of the larger ones are still going strong and doing amazing work which is great to see. A few however have taken all of the words I have written and attached some else’s name to them.</p>
<p>This isn’t an ego rubbing post, I try to keep that in check nowadays. I just don’t understand the ethics behind it. When did this become the norm? I don’t care about the words. Delete them for all that it matters, but don’t pretend someone else wrote them instead. It’s unethical to say the least, doubly so if you have the audacity to show adverts against them.</p>
<p>I go backwards and forwards on whether this actually matters or not, and in the grand scheme of things it doesn’t. It is a modern day, internet publishing side effect. Something that it seems is to be expected from time to time, the price to pay for handing over work to others. This is ultimately why I moved to blogging for myself and away from platforms such as Medium.</p>
<p>Writing for other websites has its advantages. There is a editor there to pick up my typos and lambast my poor grammar. Yet also someone there making decisions that determine what happens to your words. With me just left to wonder where my name has gone, and why.</p>

<p>There are so many things I don’t understand about technology companies, and even more I don’t understand about users. We are almost predisposed to pick a side and sick with them to the bitter end (<a title="not being a fan boy is hard" href="https://gr36.com/2017-10-25-not-being-a-fan-boy-is-hard/">not being a fan boy is hard</a>). Yet the companies we stick by make the strangest of decisions for us, locking down customisations, installing default apps or even ripping off brands users claim to hate.</p>
<p>Brands copying Apple has been the norm for as long as I can remember. It felt like every Windows Laptop for years looked like the MacBook Air, every Samsung phone looked like the iPhone 3g(s) and even now manufactures put in a needless notch after criticising Apple design.</p>
<p>When using Android I defended the OEM for being able to do as they please, and it must be what users want. Huawei <a href="https://gr36.com/2016-06-21-huaweip9-review/">made their version of Android</a> as close to iOS as they could, Xiaomi did even worse and everyone carried on regardless. This in itself isn’t a massive deal, but I cant shake the feeling that blatantly ripping off other companies design must feel a little insulting as a user.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, Huawei is copying Apple; but I’m not a patent lawyer, I just want to see good tech proliferate — Vlad Savov, The Verge</p></blockquote>
<p>I completely understand where reviewers like Vlad are coming from, good technology should spread through the whole industry so everyone can use it. It doesn’t have to be a carbon copy of the originator though surely. Why must they do it so blatantly, is it to dupe users into thinking they have the ‘real’ version? For users to trick other into thinking they have spent more money than they have? I cant think of a single reason outside of brand culture that explains why everything looks almost the same.</p>
<p>This isn’t even a design issue, its purely an aesthetic issue. Brands such as Huawei are more than capable of distinguishing themselves, phones such as the Honor 9 are brilliantly designed. Users should demand more from companies and not blatant copies of other products.</p>

<p>As I work on producing more and more podcast audio headphones are becoming one of the most important things in my tech arsenal. My trusty wood backed over ear wired headphones that I have been using since EuroTech Talk (I have no idea what they are they came free with a subscription to wired) are no longer cutting it.</p>
<p>My requirements are as much noise cancelling as possible, a wired connection for the times I’m using a mixer, and most importantly they must be over ear. I’ve used some <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beats-Dr-Dre-Wireless-Headphones-Black/dp/B01LW0M4J1/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521882178&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=solo+3&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=a876c4c968415aac9658e0cce98feb52">Beats Solo3</a> for a while and due to being on ear they are uncomfortable after an hour or so of use.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of models that fit into this category, with price tags anywhere from just over £100 to north of £500. Almost all of these, there are considered to be 3-4 leaders, and hundreds of reviews comparing them all together. Most people give the nod to the Sony WH-1000X closely followed by the stalwart of any long haul flight the Bose QC.</p>
<p>Yet as much as I know that the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-WH-1000XM2-Cancelling-Resolution-Recognition-Black/dp/B074ZRG5MN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521881813&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sony+1000xm2&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=1d3870b83c3e3f092a00db5a8ea802a9">Sony WH-1000XM2</a>, or equally the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B01E3SNO1G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521881787&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=BOse+QC35&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=7c0d32d221b6eb1d208501606080b5fd">Bose QuietComfort 35</a> or the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sennheiser-PXC-550-Wireless-Cancelling-Black/dp/B01E3XLNA0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521881730&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Sennheiser+PXC+550&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=e4cc1101fde208a3a4a5290d7e15b438">Sennheiser PXC 550</a> are the much better choice for sound. Any headphones produced with the W chip in must become a consideration – so I must also take into account the Beats Studio 3 simply because they are so easy to use.</p>
<p>Many times I have used my AirPods to walk down the gym, and switched to my <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beats-Dr-Dre-BeatsX-Earphones-Black/dp/B01LW9IKX7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521884335&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=beats+x&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=265528e898c78c9ed48651da32c1d568">Beats X</a> or Solo3 for working out without missing a single beat. Many people dismiss the Beats headphones as sounding overly bass heavy, but more modern versions are better, and I can forgive this if I don’t have to fiddle with the Bluetooth connection screen for 5 minutes before each use.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B01E3SNO1G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521881787&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=BOse+QC35&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=7c0d32d221b6eb1d208501606080b5fd">Bose QC35ii</a> even have a ‘Google Assistant button’ which is pretty much useless when using an iPhone. This is no fault of Google assistant, or Bose, but Apple Music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YKe2nndGUc">music controls are extremely limited</a>. The smartphone wars are now extending towards headphone manufactures and car companies, what a time to be alive.</p>
<p>Ultimately I wanted something comfortable and ’neutral’ sounding so I went with the Bose (my personal preference), but it just shows what a difference the W chips have made. If they were not installed in the Beats range they wouldn’t even be in the conversation.</p>

<p>This is becoming a bit of a regular occurrence, I’m on a roll creating Workflows to make my writing easier. This latest one uses my new todo app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Things</a> and my favourite notes app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bear/id1016366447?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Bear</a> to make sure I catch all the ideas I have for blog posts.</p>
<p>Thats not to say it can’t be used for other things, reminders that you need to add a lot of text in. An idea you need to expand on later, whatever it is this Workflow will make sure you don’t forget about it.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2018-03-13-workflow-idea-screenshots-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7a48e306fb.jpg" alt="2018 03 13 workflow idea screenshots 1" width="1000" height="665" border="0" /><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/eba6f5949e9e443c8aa4a5e843fe39e2">Download the Workflow.</a></p>
<p>Once you’ve <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/eba6f5949e9e443c8aa4a5e843fe39e2">downloaded the Workflow</a> obviously you will need Bear Notes app. If you’re unsure on what it is and if it’s worthwhile <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-01-19-bear-app-review/">check out my review first.</a> Unless you want to sync between devices or export in PDF the app is completely free. Don’t forget to grant access to Bear in Workflow before you try and run it!</p>
<p>The Workflow will ask you for a title for your idea, and then for any extra notes you want to add. Once these are added it will create a new Bear note with your idea title and notes, then create a new Things todo with the same title. In the Things item there will be a link to the Bear note and also a reminder set for this evening.</p>
<p>You can of course remove the reminder but I find it really handy to set one for later on so I can flesh out the idea further and most importantly I don’t forget about it!</p>
<p>The Workflow takes full advantage of the new automation and URL scheme added into the 3.4 update. For extra customisation you can edit the URL at the bottom with all sorts of extras. For hints and tips how to do this check out the link builder on the <a href="https://support.culturedcode.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2803573">Things support page</a>.</p>

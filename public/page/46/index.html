      <p>My <a href="https://glass.photo/gr36">Glass subscription</a> will be coming to an end in the upcoming weeks, and I don’t know what to do with it. Well, that’s a lie, I do, but I’m almost 90% sure I’ll end up paying another year just for the sake of fitting in.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong the app, and the website, is pretty, and I do think it is a good place for photographers to post. However, I only really post to it because it doesn’t really speak to me. I don’t feel a pull to post my photo there, and it wasn’t until posting more to micro.blog that I remembered to reinstall in on my new phone.</p>
<p>People I like post to it, the service keeps getting better and better, but I don’t get any real value from it. There are no more nice comments or sharing photo spots like there was when it started up. Appreciations are done well, but took away all the comments, and that really sucks. As much as I don’t want Glass to just be another social media channel, it doesn’t feel like a community and that is the biggest things stopping real engagement.</p>
<p>Couple with this my <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/02/trying-to-slim.html">recent tidying up of my expenses</a> and realisation of how much I could save a month by using different apps, means I am 90% of the way there. The cost isn’t extortionate but it all ads up!</p>
<p>I have a feeling I will end up just keeping it around or get FOMO at some point after I have cancelled.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>In my journey to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/putting-a-system-in-place/">improve my overall systems</a> of things and also <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/02/trying-to-slim.html">slim down on some expenditure</a> has taken a lot longer than expected. There could be many reasons for this, the number of services available, my persistent love of switching, or just my lack of motivation – however I needed to get notes right first, so this is where I started.</p><p>A <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/writing-instead-of-scrolling/">surprising amount of my time</a> is spent writing notes. They are used to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-i-use-2/">manage my life</a>, keep my writing ideas and also save anything that I find interesting and don’t want to try to remember. Because of their importance, I have tried to lean on service that I think show the importance of these notes. Services like <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/roam-research-as-my-second-brain/">Roam Research</a>, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-keep-coming/">Bear</a>, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-i-use-2/">Agenda</a>, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-obsidian-set/">Obsidian</a> and many more have come and gone. Costing me money and wasting time transferring things backwards and forwards.</p><p>As much as I want to be <em>that guy</em> and carry around a notebook and sketch things out. The reality is that I have to make all of these notes digital and searchable. Only one app has remained consistently used in all my time, Apple Notes. There could be many reasons it has remained despite repeated attempts to replace it. Perhaps the inbuilt nature means that it works with more things. Maybe it is simply because it is always there, but despite its shortcomings in a few areas, Apple Notes has proven the most robust and stable thing to use <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/using-ios-apple/">for years</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/81a3cc6f6c.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>Of course, this is a bit of a meme at the moment. Other people's reliance on Apple Notes proves to be constant with my experience and usage, but the internet never fails to make fun of things. I find this particularly hilarious because the journey from low IQ to high IQ is precisely what I have been feeling over the last few years. Despite using almost all the apps in this meme, I use Apple notes more than anything else, so it makes sense to just lean on this in my new system.</p><p>Don’t confuse this for a gushing review of all the things Apple Notes does better. There are flaws and plenty of them. Apple Notes doesn’t do everything I want it to. Apps like <a href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam Research</a> and <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> appeal to my brain much better than the rigid folder structure of Apple Notes. The linking between items and highlighting relationships features in all other options <em>but</em> Apple's option is more appealing. That is without the reality that Apps like Bear look and work infinitely better than my most used app.</p><p>Yet all the others fall down in others area in my systems, and the way I work means that the inbuilt abilities of Notes on my Mac and iPhone trumps nearly all.</p><h2 id="quick-notes">Quick Notes</h2><p>The backbone of most of my note-taking is <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/notes/apdf028f7034/mac">Quick Notes</a>, both the function in Apple Notes and the ability to take notes as quickly as possible. I realise that I am in a privileged position of using iPhone, Mac and iPad, but it doesn’t matter if I click in the bottom right on Mac. Or swipe in on iPad, or tap the icon in control centre — all the notes I take on the fly appear in the Quick Notes folder in Apple Notes.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/cbe100f182.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>I use this as an inbox for all the notes I take on the go. If I were to use the system outlined by Tiago Forte in <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com">Building A Second Brain</a>, this would be my Capture phase. Everything and anything gets saved as a quick note to be referred to or filed later. I am not crazy on the rigid folder structure of Apple notes. My brain doesn’t work as well in this hierarchy as it would when compared to a daily note approach used in Roam or Obsidian. However, having an inbox makes it easier for me to refer to things and then schedule in times to sort through them to action, file or delete the notes created.</p><h2 id="siri">Siri</h2><p>There’s a lot to be frustrated at Siri for, but it works quite well with the stock apps and means notes can be made on the go. This comes in particularly useful when driving, or out walking with AirPods in. The example below is a typical note I would make whilst walking, a book is mentioned in a podcast that sounds interesting, I make a note and act the note later when I have time.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/25e5d9ad65.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>Of course, I <em>could</em> try to remember all of these notes, and some people claim that systems like these make our brains soft. However, I have been making robust notes for a little over 3 years on everything I do, work, family, entertainment and much more. This has made me able to retain more information, improve my productivity and enjoy more time switched off.</p><h2 id="note-taking">Note-Taking</h2><p>It goes without saying that quick notes on the go are only one part of note-taking. There are far more notes containing large pieces of information, meeting notes and important things I need to save, potentially indefinitely. What I have come to realise when speaking to others in similar situations is that much of theirs are done on paper, if at all.</p><p>There is a certain level of expectation when watching interesting videos, reading non-fiction books, or just attending a meeting that the information you receive will just stick in your brain. This might just be me, but what I found out fairly early on at University is that taking notes and reading them back later, at least a couple of times, helps me be able to refer to them later on.</p><p>This can be by mentally recalling them fully and being able to quote some information, or simply being able to recall “I’m sure I have a note on that somewhere”. A typical one of my longer notes is shown below. Whilst listening to another podcast with Dave Brailsford, he highlighted some information about his CORE method of mentorship. I was able to make a quick note using Siri and then when I had more time I looked into it deeper and made longer notes.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/98acc9470f.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>The ability of Apple Notes to seamlessly switch between voice, written text and even handwritten notes, as with my CORE note, is outstanding and something that very few other services do as well. I am not one for dragging in images or links, but Apple Notes does this with ease too.</p><h1 id="file-reference">File &amp; Reference</h1><p>What’s the point of a note if you can’t find it later on? The information in notes needs to be searchable and easy to navigate. I have not adopted any more of Tiago Forte method of note-taking with storage, but instead adopted for easy to understand folders. Some <em>are</em> projects I am working on, but most are just an area of my life.</p><p>I have to say that most notes go in the bin after a small action, or become much longer ones after researching topics. So long-term storage is only those that I really do need. I found some people online talking about almost a decade's worth of notes in Evernote, and I shudder to think of the mess, but the most important thing is being able to search and find what you are looking for.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/ee0a89c66d.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>I could go deeper and use tags and a larger volume of folders; however, I have found there is much less metal stress of deciding where the notes go if there are fewer folders to choose from. Furthermore, I will only create a new folder if there is no suitable folder already.</p><p>Deciding what notes to keep is a hard choice, but with quick notes usually being actionable, it is important to me to be ruthless and only keep information for as long as it is useful. Apple Notes Search is on device, meaning that it is always fast and easy to find what I need. The powerful indexing also searched had written text with surprising accuracy, even with my terrible hand writing!</p><p>Having toyed with Readwise and all sorts of ways to import reading notes, that just never stick an inbuilt app just makes sense. Without doubt Apple Notes is <em>the</em> app I use the most. Now I have my system in place it is working even better for me and meaning I can write more posts and know where all my stuff is.</p>

      <p>A simple idea, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFvdHfhVIsQ">stollen from YouTuber Struthless</a> to replace what is ultimately bad for me, with something that is better. He replaced Social media with ‘micro-journalling’ to improve his mental health and found some exceptional benefits, so for the last couple of days I have replaced <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/31/of-course-i.html">my doom scrolling</a> with writing.</p><p>To succeed, let's face it a task like this <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/twitter-muscle-memory/">isn’t as easy as it seems</a>, I needed to make some modifications to the way my phone works. I am not actively avoiding Social Media (AKA Quitting) I am just limiting it. So, I had to make sure I wouldn’t open up Twitter without realising it, and pack my home screen full of the types of apps I wanted to use instead.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/f05a77c833.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p><a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-reading-flow/">Reading</a> and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-writing-workflow/">writing</a> in all its forms went right on my home screen to make sure they are in my face as much as possible. I am trying to make as much use of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205773">Apple Notes</a> as possible to capture anything and everything that comes to mind. Having already started to lean heavily on it as part of improving my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/putting-a-system-in-place/">overall systems,</a> the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/ipad/ipad5d91fd88/ipados">quick note function</a> coming to iPhone with iOS16 is a particular favourite new feature.</p><p>This didn’t work straight away, I had to delete all the social apps from my phone too, and also make sure I was signed out in Safari too. Now whenever I get the itch or find myself a bit bored instead of drifting away and scrolling social media, I write or read something instead. One often leads to the other and a few minutes down the line the feelings have, thankfully, gone.</p><p>There’s a habit of these types of posts to be preachy, but there is none of that here. This is simply what I am doing to better <em>my</em> day-to-day life. Again, this isn’t about avoiding social media, it is just me trying to be happier and at the same time write more – win-win.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I wrote a post <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/27/my-life-doesnt.html">a few days ago</a> about not being able to switch off and be focused. Well, that was the intention, but it came across in different ways to different people. I got lots of feedback from it, ranging from useful tips and interesting conversations to the usual “here’s my unsolicited advice”—all of which I’m grateful for.</p><p>However, I do want to clarify, I do know <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/going-deeper/">how to focus</a> and when I need to. The post was simply pointing out that we don’t all live in the luxury life where we can just turn everything off. If you work for yourself, there’s a tendency to forget, some of us (most of us) have an environment we need to be contactable in.</p><p>Unfortunately, countless businesses and management of those businesses expect things done certain ways and emails to be answered, etc. I am semi lucky that I don’t work for one of them, and I get plenty of time for deep work and creativity if I need it. Which, I doubt is the case for most people.</p><p>There’s a lot of research to suggest that the average time workers actually spend working in a day is a fraction of the period of time they are “at work”. Most experiencing <a href="https://clockify.me/blog/productivity/workplace-distractions/">56 distractions a day</a>, which is insane levels of outside noise to be expected to work in.</p><p>There is no luxury of turning off your email, or unplugging your phone in these places, and they are often starved of focused time to be able to do things properly. All the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/indistractable/">self-help books</a>, <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/a-world-without-email/">dreaming of a world without email</a> and productivity advice in the world won’t make a dent if the company culture doesn’t change.</p><p>Focused work is so important to each worker at all levels of employment. Yet, much like the weirdness we are seeing with working from home, there is a tendency to lean into “that’s just how we’ve always done it” and expect email to be answers straight away and phone calls to be taken. How many times have you sat in a meeting that should have been an email?</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It seems like an age ago I wrote about <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/love-stadia/">loving Stadia</a>. It has its issues, is always a few days away <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/google-insists-stadia-is-not-shutting-down">from being killed</a>, but it brought me back into gaming because of the ease of access. I had my iPad, adopted my son's Playstation controller, and I was away. Sure, I always think about building a gaming PC, but I probably never will, so enter the Steam Deck – level 2 of casual gaming.</p><p>To understand where this fits in and why the Steam Deck has made a difference to my gaming and life, the context is important. Despite playing numerous games at a young age, I stopped for so many years that I forget how many. I felt as if playing games was a waste of time, and I didn’t have many spare hours to spend gaming anyway.</p><p>Since playing on Stadia, I purchased an <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/instant-on/">Xbox One Series X</a> and despite it being a great device, playing in-front of a TV doesn’t suit my life all the time. It scratched my itch, but I didn’t have the time between everything else I had to do, a handheld device I can pick up and put down would be a much better fit. Thankfully, Vale’s hard to get Steam Deck provided cutting-edge gaming on the go.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/782d305619.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>Don’t expect this to be some kind of review, more of an overview of how much I have fallen in love with this device. Since picking on up from a friend of a friend for a reasonable price, I’ve been able to play great PC games on the go, as well as <a href="https://www.emudeck.com">install emulators</a> for an all-around experience.</p><p>I don’t use my Steam Deck for even half of what it can do. I don’t hack it or tweak it or do anything that ‘real gamers’ might do. However, I do play it to death, so much so I am worried about the longevity of the battery as I have to charge it up so often. A point that is exaggerated by the fact the battery is not the best, about 2 hours of gaming is all it can handle whilst playing anything graphically intense.</p><p>It isn’t all good news. If you’re a casual gamer like me, knowing what to play is a pain. The Steam library seems to talk in some know of second language and recommend games that I have to google to find out what the gameplay is like. So, YouTube is my best friend for the games I do buy, which is far too many of them.</p><p>All these words are to say that the Steam Deck is a great device. Not the best gaming set up in the world, but just what a casual gamer needs to be able to play more and enjoy a woder selection of games.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I am starting to think my brain is fundamentally broken. I <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/30/placebo.html">can’t sleep</a>, can’t <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/27/210805.html">sit still,</a> and literally can’t do anything online without scrolling through social media.</p>
<p>It happens when I am not paying attention, and then I suddenly realise that post I sat down to write isn’t getting finished off, not are those photos getting edited. Instead, I am down a rabbit whole of the worst things about humanity or finding out why someone is getting cancelled on Twitter today.</p>
<p>I don’t think this is an attention thing like I have suffered from before, more of an entertainment need. Perhaps now is the time to take a step back from the online world and write more. That seemed to work for <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/when-im-coming-back-to-twitter/">Matt Birchler</a>, and was a big reason I had a <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/going-deeper/">very productive end of last year</a>.</p>
<p>It isn’t easy for me to quite social media because it&rsquo;s pretty much where all of my social interaction comes from (sad I know), but I am going to try.</p>
<p>❌ Twitter
❌ Reddit
❌ Instagram
☑️ Writing
☑️ Reading
☑️ micro.blog</p>

      <p>For reasons that I <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/27/210805.html">don’t really want to go into,</a> I’ve had to resort to <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/29/wondered-why-the.html">sleeping tablets</a>. Nothing major, just <a href="https://www.nytol.co.uk/nytol-range/nytol-herbal">herbal things</a> to help me drop off and stay asleep. I’ve used them before, many years ago, and found they really help when I’m struggling to get enough shut-eye.</p>
<p>I popped the first one last night “30-60 minutes before bedtime” as instructed, but felt the effects in minutes. Except I couldn’t have. The tablet had barely reached my stomach, yet I felt tired purely because of placebo. My mind had already decided this tablet was going to make me sleepy, so exaggerated its effects.</p>
<p>It’s remarkable how much the placebo effect has on our lives. Every single human trial has to account for the fact your brain can fix things for you. Kind of makes me want to just take sugar pills instead and see if that puts me to sleep too.</p>
<p>Thankfully I went to sleep, and despite waking a couple of times went straight back to sleep and had a deep dream filled few hours for the first time in a long time.</p>

      <p>It doesn’t take more than a few minutes for the uncomfortable feeling to set in. Tiny little pin pricks that raise in intensity while I am still. Prodding me towards doing something, anything, just stop being still.</p>
<p>My attention hasn’t wandered. I am not bored, if anything I love being bored. Yet, my mind will not let me relax before it is reminding me to not waste my time and do something, anything.</p>
<p>Playing games, waste of time. You should be reading or working out, or writing, or doing something constructive. I have to make the most of the time I have, don’t I?</p>
<p>This is not a recent thing, either. It drives my wife up the wall because I am so restless. Stillness is the only indicator of when I am <em>really</em> ill.</p>
<p>For years, I have felt like I have to hack my life to constantly be better. I need to quit doing this, maximise that, do two things at once. My brain only has two states, and constant rages at me that whatever I am doing is either wrong or not done enough.</p>
<p>Even when I <em>am</em> still, I am thinking about what to do next.</p>

<p>Between 6am and noon is arguably my most precious / important / valuable time of the day for getting things done.
That’s why I keep all of my devices in Do Not Disturb until noon.
This way I am free from any and all notifications, pings, buzzes, until the morning is over and it’s time for a lunch break.</p></blockquote>

<p>The buzzes and dings that wouldn’t disturb my life. Leaving my kids to fend for themselves with any issues, no boss disturb my concentration, and nothing ever break that needs my attention.</p>
<p>That would be the life.</p>

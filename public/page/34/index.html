<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>There appears to be a collective belief that the world of blogging is changing. It is true that we are living in an era where Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is transforming the way content is produced. I’m just not convinced that it will change the way I, or most people I know, blog. Mainly due to the reasons why most people blog being entirely different to those of content farms doing it for income.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no denying that platforms like Chat GPT could make it easier and more efficient for me to create content. That content could allow me to be more targeted, engaging, and interactive, but there in lies the issue. Ask any AI to create a blog post, and it will churn out SEO optimised, un-personal content full of basic facts. There won’t be any feeling or thought-provoking statements. It won’t feel like me.</p>
<p>AI uses (NLP) algorithms to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This technology allows the user to craft content based on various factors, so in theory I could create blog posts based on my understanding how my audience interacts with my blog. Refining posts to better meet their needs. That just isn’t blogging though, is it.</p>
<p>The prediction is that I could go deep in the weeds and start personalising content to each individual reader. By recognising the topics, my readers are most interested in and the types of content they prefer, AI could deliver more relevant, personalised content to keep them engaged. Automating the creation process as we go. No more writing, editing nor publishing. Blog posts would be created based on keywords or topics with little to no input.</p>
<p>Does that sound like blogging to you because it certainly doesn’t for me. What AI will create is a stark difference between people writing on their website and companies doing it for money. The whole point of blogging is writing and expressing yourself. No AI can do that, nor will they ever because being involved in the process is the entire point.</p>
<p>A blog post is like a conversation between a writer and a reader. You can tell when the post has been crafted and constructed using experience and thought. It hasn&rsquo;t been pumped out for clicks. Unfortunately, as tools become easier to use, like those built into <a href="https://www.notion.so/product/ai">Notion</a> and <a href="https://www.craft.do/blog/craft-assistant-future-ai">Craft</a>, bloggers may take the easy route, but at that point they won&rsquo;t be bloggers any more.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>There are not many things that improve my life straight away any more. Meditation did exactly that around 6 years ago, and now journaling is doing the same thing. You read that right, me, journaling. After all my dismissive posts and words over the years of not knowing or wanting to write in one. I’ve got to admit, it’s quite remarkable.</p>
<p>I realise that it is only the end of January, and it’s easy to exaggerate the benefits before the novelty has worn off, but hear me out. I also might be preaching to the choir a bit here, as many people that I follow are already proponents, but I’ll talk about it regardless. This isn’t a New Year’s resolution, but more like a reevaluation, one that I <a href="/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html">talked about before starting out</a>. I paid up for a year of Day One to see what happens, it also went to the store and bought some journals too. This is a journey split into two parts.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/230ac89cf0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="day-one">Day One</h2>
<p>A long journey starts with a single step, and that tiny little movement forward was actually posting to Day One. I’ve <a href="/2022/12/28/outside-of-twitter.html">had it installed</a> on my phone more times that I care to remember, but struggled to write much. Instead of spending any money on this crazy idea I had, I made myself start writing at least one post a day electronically. It was a little test for me that I had to complete for me to gain the reward of any expenditure.</p>
<p>After the first couple of day of writing, frankly nonsense, each morning, I could see the difference. By not expending too much mental energy and letting my fingers type out exactly what I was thinking about and feeling with no prompts, I literally kick-started my day. I felt happier, more relaxed and resolved my thoughts first thing in the morning. After just <a href="/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html">5 days I stumped up</a> and bought Premium because I knew straight away I was on to a <a href="/2023/01/09/day-streak.html">winning idea</a>.</p>
<p>Now 29 days in, I’ve posted consistently at least once a day as early as I get time. This is a <a href="https://littlecoffeefox.com/morning-pages-changed-life/">morning pages</a> of sorts, a literal brain dump of everything swirling around in my head. I have often followed this up with smaller thoughts and any other things that I am thinking about. It took effort and went slowly at first, with great trepidation.</p>
<p>Whenever I get a feeling or a thought, I reach for Day One now and just type it out to see where I get to. Some of these turn into blog posts, but most don’t. They are just for me, and I probably won’t read them again. Just knowing they are there is enough to make me feel better. I would love to do this manual with a pen and paper, but the thought of it being accessible by others terrifies me. Not because I have anything to hide, but it’s embarrassing to think of someone else reading my thoughts.</p>
<p>Due to how well this small step went, I treated myself early and bought a bullet journal, thus starting the second step of my transformation.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1a3abb569c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="bullet-journal">Bullet Journal</h2>
<p>A massive experience that paid off. That’s the way I’m describing my bullet journal that is constantly open on my desk or in my hand being carried from meeting to meeting. Where I once sit typing away into my MacBook, I’m now writing into my bullet journal and people are noticing the difference.</p>
<p>On the surface, I know that I shouldn’t be using a manual bullet journal for task planning and note taking. It makes no sense, as I’ve <a href="/2022/12/31/i-really-want.html">covered before</a>, <a href="/2022/06/21/putting-a-system.html">more than once</a>. It’s often redundant, takes more work and isn’t searchable. I realise when a spend so much time at a computer or with a phone, it makes sense to use digital tools. Yet writing things out manually, being intentional about things, and just flipping through pages ignites something in me.</p>
<p>It is as if the physical act of bullet journaling stimulates me more. I remember more things, take more notes, manage and plan things better. There appears to be no downsides. Well, perhaps the slightly precarious position that all physical things are in. Bar loosing my book, or not having it with me, it’s all positives.</p>
<p>To combat this slightly, I’ve adopted a ‘Field Notes’ notebook that’s usually in my back pocket, just in case. Mine is actually a Moleskin version, but most people are more accustomed to what Field Notes looks like. This is perhaps the most significant change in my life and one many people have commented on. I’ll admit it’s a little weird, but it helps me live a much more intentional life, and is another solution to <a href="/2022/02/10/the-ultimate-minimalist.html">my life becoming phone free</a>.</p>
<p>Seen something worth thinking about. Make a note. Heard something on a podcast that I want to research later. Make a note. Thought about a peculiar thing that you would like to find the answer to. Make a note. Seriously. Yesterday I wrote in my field notes “what is the psychological theory why you see new things all the time”. Turns out I was thinking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion">frequency illusion</a> or the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon. Could I have found this out with a quick Google on my phone, of course, but I would have forgotten it as quickly as I looked it up.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6f3b7d74bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The physical act of writing something down improves my memory of it - <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2021.634158/full">it’s science</a>! Yet, every person I mention this too seems blown away by manual writing things down. Is it a bit of a pain transferring things if I want to write about them or research them later, yes. That’s the point though. I can review all the notes I make, and think about them several times, with a quick flick through my field notes. Leading to better retention, more ideas and more awareness of my thoughts.</p>
<p>For me there is often a tendency to preach about a new practice that has yielded results too early. So I have tried to put off writing about this for a while. There’s often a turning point at the start of the year, even if you don’t make resolutions per se, just to decide to do things a bit differently. However I am well past January 14th which is <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2022/01/17/have-you-quit-your-new-years-resolution-by-quitters-day/">quitters day</a>, and don’t see these new practices changing.</p>
<p>I think there are more <a href="/2022/12/31/manual-practices-to.html">manual things</a> that I can bring in to aid my digital life. As I said, intellectually I know that perhaps leaning on apps is the way to go, but emotionally and mentally writing things down and ticking things off fulfils me more.</p>

     <p>Derek Kedziora writing about <a href="https://derekkedziora.com/notes/20230128090757">giving up alcohol</a> a few months also.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was never a daily drinker, but I was always had one beer too many at parties and heavily relied on a bit of alcohol for confidence and getting through awkward social situations.</p></blockquote>
<p>After drawing back and consuming much less for a while, it’s been a little over a month since I decided to give up alcohol. I had written a long post about this, but read Derek’s post above yesterday, and it distilled most of my thoughts into a paragraph.</p>
<p>In the UK, alcohol consumption has a strange place in society. It’s seen as something you just do as an adult. Stressed, get a beer. Feel a bit down, get a beer. Want to have fun, alcohol is involved somewhere. Even though I’ve never had an issue with alcohol, this is where <em>my</em> issue is. It’s an avoidance technique to dealing with difficult feelings and isn’t the solution.</p>
<p>So, I feel better. My mental health is better. I’ve lost a bit of weight and I just feel better in myself. I’ve had just two drinks since Boxing Day and I feel great.</p>

With iPhones. The problem is (that is my issue, not Apples) that there are too many iPhones, and I wish we could just go back to one version.</p>
<p>I write regularly about wanting to <a href="/2020/08/09/i-cant-go.html">go back to not having a smartphone</a>. I also write fairly regularly about my justification of <a href="/2021/08/26/minimalism-and-big.html">having a huge iPhone</a>. That’s because I am a walking paradox. I know intellectually what is best for me, but I also have crippling FOMO, so I go around in circles.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/272bc58a76.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I often think I need a smaller phone. Or a bigger one. Or no phone at all. What I always want is the opposite of what I have. Because I’ve fallen for the fallacy that a specific thing will change everything. Almost like the <a href="https://notes.gr36.com/provisional-life">provisional life</a> that Swiss psychologist Marie-Louise von Franz proposes. I am convinced that once I have the other version of this thing, <em>then</em> I’ll have the device I’m happy with.</p>
<p>There once was a magical time when Apple produced one iPhone, I bought that and used it for a year until the new one came out. Then came a plus version that I deliberated on a bit and usually bought the big version. Now I have (if I include last year&rsquo;s mini version) five to choose from. Well, 4 really because no one wants an iPhone 14 plus.</p>
<p>All with their advantages and disadvantages, not to mention various price points. Giving customers excellent choice. Which means that someone always has the version you don’t and the grass always seems greener to someone like me. Even after years of knowing that I have this issue, I still haven’t solved it. Despite all the minimalism mantras and deep thinking, my issue with iPhone remains, and it could be an issue forever.</p>

     <p>Luke Harris on his blog, writing about <a href="https://www.lkhrs.com/blog/2022/11/twitter/">social media as a whole</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m on Mastodon, but I’m bored with what I call “the timeline era”. Scanning an unending stream of disconnected posts for topics of interest is no longer fun, I prefer deciding what to read based on titles, or topic-based discussion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before I start, I need to point out, early enough in my post, that I understand all the benefits of Mastodon. I don’t need you to yell at me that I “don’t get it” like you did when I criticised the onboarding process.</p>
<p>Mastodon promises to be a much better place than Twitter because of the way it is set up. But as it gets busier and busier, and <a href="https://social.lol/@birchtree@mastodon.social/109756966498236415">popular users start to struggle </a>like they did on Twitter. It becomes more and more apparent to me that it’s only a matter of time before it suffers very similar issues.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s not going to shove terrible content in your face for engagement, but the main feed is far too busy now to enjoy. Without some kind of filtering and algorithm, Mastodon is frankly impossible to follow. Not to mention the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-reply-guys">reply guys</a> are there, with all their <a href="/2021/06/11/but-what-about.html">“what about”</a> tendencies.</p>
<p>I was expecting more from <a href="/2021/01/11/social-media-in.html">social media in 2021</a>, and I’m still waiting for something better. The problem is, as Luke covers in his post, snacking on the internet and trying to follow a never-ending stream of disconnected post is ultimately unfulfilling.</p>

     <p>I give myself a hard time about the things I do and getting the most out of my short time in this mortal coil. I obsess over things like <a href="/2022/12/20/overthinking-social-media.html">social media usage</a>, <a href="/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html">writing practices</a> and lots more I don’t write about. It does get me down some times, but here’s the thing, I am confident I put thought into the right things.</p>
<p>Sure, I might occasionally spend too much time comparing <a href="/2021/03/19/looking-for-my.html">writing apps</a> or to-do tasks but, in the main, the things I put thought into are important. As Oliver Burkeman <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780374159122">points out</a> in great detail, our life on in this pace is limited to about 4,000 weeks. If it takes me time and a bit of mental energy to decide I want to avoid looking at social media as often as my chimp brain wants to. For me, that’s good time spent. Deciding what I am happy with and is correct going forward.</p>
<p>I think it <em>is</em> critical to think about the things you do if they are to make a large impact. Obsessing over details that will save time, money, energy are the best things to worry about. Spending time worrying about what blogging platform to use, or what reading app gets your money is arguably a different thing all together, but we’ve all been there.</p>
<p>Only you personally know whether these things are important to you or not. The unfortunate thing is that you only really find out what’s significant from experience. I hate to think of the amount of time I’ve wasted tweaking CSS or building themes for my blog that didn’t really matter — but I enjoyed every moment. I learnt things, and broke things, and I picked up skills in the process.</p>
<p>Any other person on the planet though would probably class that as wasted time. They would look at me weirdly that I spent a good few weeks thinking hard about social media usage, when they don’t give it a second thought. What I think is important is unique to me. I would view my tinkering completely differently if I wanted to be a real writer. Perhaps I should have spent it <a href="/2020/08/17/sitting-in-the.html">sitting in the chair</a> and learning the craft.</p>
<p>They do say that perfection is the enemy of progress. At some point you <em>do</em> have to stop worrying about the how’s and the why&rsquo;s and get going. Doing the things you set out to do and sticking to it. If that’s the case, you’re not thinking about important things any longer. You need to start moving forward instead of getting in your own way.</p>

     <p>The posts I write do not disappear into the recesses of my mind, I think about them often. My thoughts and feelings often change over time, but when it comes to my attitudes towards work, I’ve remained fairly fixed for years. Whereas the general perception of work has had a major culture shift, accelerated by the pandemic, and one that is great for the world. Hustle culture and working because that’s what you’re supposed to do has been replaced by a desire for more.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5904fd6f64.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As the post points out, you shouldn’t be working for anything else but yourself. Not in the sense that we should all have our own businesses, that would be great too. More in the sense that you should want to do the work or the tasks you do. It might seem like meaningless tautology, but the importance of stressing that “You make the job; it doesn’t make you” is vital.</p>
<p>At the root of every position you take should be a root desire for you. It doesn’t matter what that desire is, nor the way it manifests itself. It should be something that fulfils you. Emotionally. Spiritually. Furthermore, it is at this point I must bring up the excellent words of Patrick Rhone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I were paid to dig ditches, I would discover that the ditch is for a water line to a new house that means someone gets clean water. Once I think it through, I can find my passion in the ditch digging. - <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/profit-and-passion/">Patrick Rhone</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. You can still have a job, it be a job, and you don’t need to be excited by it, nor it reflect anything about you. However, I would bet that you can find something in it to be excited about, but even so that job isn’t you. You are not your job, you are a person, and your job should be how you make money to be that person.</p>
<p>I’m one of the lucky ones. I have a job I enjoy, and it lifts me up as a person. It is still not me. Unfortunately, not many people are as lucky as I. To leave you with one take away, a distillation of all of these words down to a few, it is to remember “You are not the work you do; you are the person you are”.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Around this time two years ago, I decided that there was a whole medium I need to get more out of, Podcasts. I spent a lot of my time listening to them whilst driving, walking the dog and many other things. Listening to some fascinating shows, but I never took much away from them apart from surface level enjoyment. So, I decided I needed to hack them like <a href="/2020/08/22/my-reading-flow.html">I did with reading</a> and start to make notes against all the points I found interesting. I was wrong.</p>
<p>First things first, there is something to be said for taking notes from a podcast. Perhaps not every podcast (maybe ignore most of the points made on Joe Rogan, for example) but many that I listen to are information dense, and I sometimes think that I’d like to learn more about this. With that said, with the ability to note everything down, and have it synced over into an app ruined a lot of the experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b13c41cd83.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Not only was I triple clicking my AirPods like crazy (that’s the shortcut to save a clip in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/airr-audio-conversations/id1355926315">podcast app Airr</a>) I was missing the whole point of listening frequently. Due to the volume of notes I was making, the actual process of saving and going over them later was untenable. When you note everything, it misses the point of note-taking completely. If everything becomes a note, then nothing does.</p>
<p>Not to mention that podcasts became something to concentrate on and worry whether I should have noted that last statement or not. Constantly reminding and listening again to see if I got the point, rather than consuming something in the background whilst doing a more important task. It didn’t take me very long to burn out and not want to listen to anything any more.</p>
<p>Much <a href="/2022/04/10/reading-doesnxt-need.html">like reading</a>, for me, some activities don’t need to be hacked to get the most out of them. They are downtime or a background content to passively consume. When I need to take notes I will every now and again, using Siri or <a href="/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html">Apple notes</a> and that suits me fine. I’ve only just returned to listening to them again because I tried too hard to make the most out of podcasts, and it made them suck. Don’t make the same mistake.</p>

     <p>Over the last few days, I’ve been reading a lot about the rediscovery of minimalism. This is 100% because of the circles I move in, but a few people around me are discussing similar thoughts and ideas that I have currently. Finding more value in having less stuff and getting back to basics.</p>
<p>I can honestly say that the original Minimalism film on Netflix, before they remade it in 2020, changed my life. It followed these two guys that I’d never heard off through their journey of spreading the ideas that turned their life around. It features some wonderful people like <a href="https://micro.blog/patrickrhone">Patrick Rhone</a> that opened my eyes to a life of enjoying experiences and people, not things.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2594bbb177.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Somewhere in the following months and years, there was a transformation in the way minimalism was portrayed. The people I followed and looked up to changed. It became like a cult of people that waved their flag of how little they had. The message became a constant cycle of telling you to sell your bed, or they were selling you stuff. Much like <a href="https://ctmiller.net/2023/01/03/minimalism-maybe.html">CT Miller</a> I fell off when minimalists were constantly trying to sell me their Patreon, or their course, or whoever else they could flog. As he puts it, “as minimalism began to dovetail with financial planning and whole food health claims, I got off the bus”.</p>
<p>Minimalism was no longer a way to live a happier life by letting go of things. It was a way to make money and virtue signal at every point along the way. A cult with arguably a good message, but a cult all the same. Those that had given up their jobs to spread the word, had run out of things to say. Minimalism is a pretty simple message, after all. So, they began to give out advice on everything and anything, like a Christian preacher that begs for donations, it ruins the message along the way.</p>
<p>The evolution was from minimalism, the way to look at the world and enjoy more things. To minimalism being a marketing angle. This happened with mediation, mindfulness and numerous other words before it. But flipping the message of less into a way to sell you things was truly disgusting.</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> still true voices out there, though. It is those that are causing this new wave of minimalism. Writers like <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/">Patrick</a> are an inspiration to people like me and helping make my life a better place. There’s true value in living with fewer things and appreciating people much more than stuff, but you have to work a bit more to find them.</p>

<p>This was very much me when I first tried out iOS15 a few weeks back. The iOS version especially just breaks my brain and every bit of muscle memory built from years of using an iPhone.</p>
<p>I still don’t get it though. Even after taking a step back and looking at the way it works. The bottom URL bar I can forgive even though it feels like changing for changing sake, but the buttons that users need are all now hidden away. Reload, share, in fact everything other than forwards and backwards is behind a nondescript three dots. This feels a little like the multi-function reply button from iOS13 so hopefully the designers will realise how stupid this is — Matt Birchler has offered up a few ideas that are straight from current HIG designs.</p>

<div>
<p>This week I chose to deactivate my Twitter account at least temporarily. There was no single reason for doing this, because if there was I am sure it would of happened long before now. It is simply because I don’t like the way using Twitter makes me feel. I have <a href="/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html">written before</a> about my love of the service, but the amount of time and attention it takes away from me. I just want to experience boredom again.</p>
<p>Every waking moment when I have a spare moment I would find myself just opening up Twitter. I say myself because this happens without conscious thought. I don’t decide to check it, my habit just kicks in and I am scrolling through the latest things being canceled or people moaning about whatever today’s thing is before I am even aware of it.</p>
<blockquote><p>I know I’m an addict because Twitter hacked itself so deep into my circuitry that it interrupted the very formation of my thoughts. …a corporation that operates against my best interests has me thinking in 280 characters. Every thought, every experience, seems to be reducible to this haiku, and my mind is instantly engaged by the challenge of concision – <a href="https://apple.news/AiWNoyb6vRgGoWgbFmj2uTQ">Caitlin Flanagan for The Atlantic</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>You see, I have learnt to avoid the rabbit holes as much as possible, but being mindful of the habit and the time wasting has been enough to wake me up to the fact it is simply not good for me. The <em>real</em> issue is that I miss some of the people that I interact with on Twitter and no where else. I have some very close friends that I wonder if they will just fall away, however what keeps me going is the fact that true friendships find a way to continue.</p>
<p>I don’t see myself falling away completely, I would like my account to still exist just in case I want to go back one day, or to check every now and again. However at the moment I don’t trust myself, I must break this addiction. This is the only way.</p>

  Social media has convinced us that any thought, regardless of effort taken in developing it, is worthy of publication.

<p>I think I have shared this post before, because it is full of relatable content and take away quotes – but this one hits perfectly.</p>
<p>When i first started with twitter seeing all the “just heading to yoga” tweets because almost everyone I followed I knew personally and the service as a whole was pretty quiet. Knowing things about the people you wanted was enjoyable and easy to get through the noise.</p>
<p>We now live in a time where everything is regurgitated onto your time line, there is no way to filter specific types of tweets, and the platform as a whole is full of noise. As such I have to move further and further away from the platform I love.</p>
<p>Not least becuase the service is determined to surface the most polarising and “engaging” tweets into my timeline and its all a bit too much.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>My blog is currently hosted on the excellent micro.blog service. I could go on about why I chose this place to host, but my thoughts are summed up on <a href="/2021/03/28/why-microblog.html">my post here</a>. It suits me perfectly because I publish everything to one place, from short ‘tweets’ to photos and also all of my writing. Due to this ease of posting I do most of it mobile from iOS with the help of some Shortcuts.</p>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>Pictures are pretty easy to handle on micro.blog. If you want to post one image with some accompanying text there are a <a href="https://micro.blog/about">range of apps</a> to use, including the very Instragram-esc <a href="https://sunlit.io">Sunlit</a>. Meaning you can post whatever you want wherever you want.</p>
<p>If you are writing a longer post and want to put some accompanying images in it, this simple Shortcut has you covered. It will upload the image to your micro.blog uploads section and then copy the link to the image directly to your clipboard ready to paste into your writing.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/1c9552c63a.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="152" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/01d2ded5a96f4dc28bbb9961642fc08b">Get It Here</a></p>
<p>All you will need to do is attain a app token by going to Account settings and scrolling to the bottom and clicking App Tokens or clicking <a href="https://micro.blog/account/apps">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Text</h2>
<p>No good posting something without any text. For Shorter ‘tweets’ a range of apps are available to making posting easier, however if you really want to speed things up this simple Shortcut for iOS will ask for your post and then…post it.</p>
<p>For longer posts with a title this simple shortcut will help you out. Simply highlight the text you want to post and share it it the Shortcut, it presumes you are writing in markdown and will remove Title formatting for you and use this as the post Title.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/735cb9231a.jpg" alt="" width="1230" height="566" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/772cc414fc5d453594d87706f3bbc465">Get It Here</a></p>
<p>All you will need to do is attain a app token by going to Account settings and scrolling to the bottom and clicking App Tokens or clicking <a href="https://micro.blog/account/apps">here</a>. This posting really is one touch. There is no facility to add in categories (I may work on this later) but I use filters very heavily so these are well worth <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/11/06/microblog-filters-with.html">looking into</a>.</p>
<p>Note: These currently do not work on iOS15!</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>If I can be allowed to stick my neck out a little here, I think the iPad is the perfect blogging device. The battery life is great, it’s very affordable, you can take it anywhere and interact with it in several different ways. In a pinch you can even take photos with it, although you might get some strange looks. Publishing from iOS has also never been easier, and here’s how to do it with a couple of Shortcuts.</p>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>Often choosing images is the hardest part of a blog post, once you’ve chosen them you have to upload them and choose where you want the go. Which can be a real pain particularly on a mobile device. WordPress is pretty easy to work with but means you have to stop what you’re doing and use either the web or their app to sort out images. This is usually where people give up, but fear not, the Shortcut below will upload your image and copy the markdown syntax for it directly to your clipboard.</p>
<p>This Shortcut was created by <a href="https://initialcharge.net/projects/toolkit/">Mike Rockwell at Initial Charge.</a> who has a whole toolkit of Shortcuts for publishers.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/211e433487.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="307" /></p>
<p>Get it <a href="https://github.com/gr36/Shortcuts/blob/276ec6a1d0773fabb11f8f8bdd85ab5b634db1ef/Upload%20Image.wflow">here</a></p>
<p>No more messing around, simply select your image, use the shortcut and paste in where you want the image to appear in your writing. You’ll need to set up a <a href="https://tinypng.com/developers">Tiny PNG account</a> with this one so you don;t take up too much space with your images and pages load faster, but its really easy to do. In fact because this Shortcut is so simple I sometimes now upload the images I want to use and paste them in first.</p>
<h2>Publishing To WordPress</h2>
<p>Once all the words are finished, the final step is to publish your posts. This usually involves copying the text, opening the web browser, logging in and going through the various steps of actually getting everything out there. This can be streamlined down to a few taps using the Shortcut below. It is one I have <a href="/2021/01/28/shortcut-publishing-to.html">shared this one before</a>, which was first created by Tim Nahumck in his <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-4-siri-shortcuts-wordpress-and-more/">drafts review</a> I simply updated it to use newer Shortcuts methods.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/ce3789c3fe.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="307" /></p>
<p>Get it <a href="https://github.com/gr36/Shortcuts/blob/276ec6a1d0773fabb11f8f8bdd85ab5b634db1ef/Publish%20to%20WordPress.wflow">here</a></p>
<p>This Shortcut will transfer all the text into a new blog post for you, as well as set the title correctly, remove any extra spacing and then ask you to confirm categories and tags. Meaning you don’t have to rely on using a app with publishing built in, you can now write your post out in any app you like such as Apple Notes.</p>
<p>There you have it, you can publish to WordPress with a few taps thanks to Shortcuts on iOS.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The future is finally here. No you still can’t work on an iPad, but game streaming is finally good and starting to remove the need for hardware. You should already know going into this that I am already well on the boat with cloud services like this, and a heavy <a href="/2021/02/13/stadia.html">Stadia user</a>. It was the service that got me <a href="/2021/03/04/playing-again.html">playing games again</a>, and although I feel no affiliation to the service, I like it very much.</p>
<p>This morning for some strange reason I noticed that I can sign up for Gamepass ultimate now for a £1! Whilst still in beta, the service allows for anyone to sign up following a pretty lengthy closed beta period. I don’t own any gaming hardware at all, so cloud services are all I am really interested in currently. Despite my love of Stadia I have alway had half an eye on Gamepass Ultimate. It contains a few games that I would want to play, and seems like it <em>should</em> put Googles dalliance with cloud gaming into the shade.</p>
<p>The two services have lots of crossover parts, whilst adopting two pretty different approaches to gaming. Stadia wants to be your everything, provide you with free games for a small fee and allow you to buy others from them. Whilst Microsoft simply wants you to pay a subscription and be allowed to play games from studios it owns or works very closely with. There is no facility to buy games outside of these provided with your subscription.</p>
<p>With Stadia, games do rotate in and out of ‘pro’ (which costs £8.99) but once you have claimed the games you can continue to play them — as long as you keep paying the subscription of course. With Gamepass you’ll never own anything, presumably games will stay on the service and more will be added, but if you stop paying, no more gaming. Where as Google will allow you to keep playing any games you have purchased without paying a penny, all be it at 1080p and not 4K like with the pro service.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/fa1d87b3c6.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" /></p>
<p>With all this said, Gamepass is actually amazing value for money, and even more so if you own an Xbox or a gaming PC. Included is Xbox Live Gold and EA Play in the £10.99 a month subscription. If you have hardware you will also get more games — for example you can play FIFA 21 on Xbox or PC, but not cloud streaming for some strange reason. However the quality of game available for free is much larger on Gamepass.</p>
<p>Ultimatly it all boils down to Microsofts ability to do what Google wanted to do. It has the power to make games available because it has been doing this longer, and owns its own studios. Google have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286252/google-stadia-studios-shut-down-timing-good-progress-report">shuttered all of its first party studios</a> despite spending millions on them, and instead are to focus on partnering with others the develop or port over games, with varying success.</p>
<p>Although Gamepass is the much better value for money, I am reluctant to jump in without being able to buy other games. this may lead to me having both services until that happens, or as MS no doubt will hope, I buy an Xbox. I see Gamepass as a huge edition if you have an Xbox or a gaming PC, and will only get stronger over time. However for someone like me I could run out of games I actually want to play fast and then have no where to go. </p>
<p>I expect Gamepass to very quickly outshine Stadia and hopefully push it to get much better. Or kill it off completely.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2021/06/29/a-question-of.html"><h1 class="p-name">A Question Of Platforms</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When publishing a link post yesterday about blogging feeling more away from regular social media, the main point picked up on was comments on my posts. As <a href="https://twitter.com/curtismchale/status/1409638107331194881?s=20">Curtis Hale points out</a> there is no provision for people to leave comments on my posts, other than replies on micro.blog.</p>
<p>I <a href="/2021/03/28/why-microblog.html">chose micro.blog recently</a> due to its social side and also the nature of the platform allowing me to post everything in one place. I didn’t spend any time wondering <a href="/2021/02/13/165913.html">where does this go</a>, and put short ‘tweets’, Instagram style photos and long blog posts all on one blog. Making the experience a bit more personal.</p>
<p>In exchange for this I get a much more rigid platform than the WordPress one I came from, and rely totally on one persons vision for what he wants. Manson does an excellent job of running micro.blog but that’s not really the point, that is to say that I have given over a large portion of control to another person. Much like Facebook and Twitter dictate what I can and can’t post, micro.blog controls the way the platform works and how it moves forwards.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/691af88fb3.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" /></p>
<p>When thinking about comments the only thing that works are micro.blog replies. I should <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/05/19/webmention-and-twitter.html">be able to pull in replies from Twitter</a> using bridg.y now, but it has never worked. I no doubt <em>could</em> look at other options and try and run a stand alone commenting system, but this would be hacked on rather than an integrated solution. Giving over this large level of control sometimes feels freeing at times, but in equal measures frustrating.</p>
<p>If the platform decides to go a direction that you don’t want to then you are at its mercy, or you pack up and leave. Something that <a href="/2020/03/03/being-able-to.html">should be easy to do</a>, but often at times isn’t. Perhaps something more open is better suited to what I want to achieve, or where I want my blog to go.</p>
<p>I am lucky in the fact that I can usually mold things to get to where I want to be and if I think about comments and the potential of avoiding the trappings of social media, my current platform does not provide it. I guess its important to think about these things when you give over control, and rember that needs can change a lot faster than platforms do.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Sure, it doesn’t have to be here which technically, I suppose, is a breach of my (self-imposed) embargo on social media but a blog (don’t ask me why) feels different. It sounds a bit woo-woo but it feels like I’m conversing with the Universe. No, not necessarily that one, but the one that circles the compass of my life.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I love Julians writing, it’s always filled with thought provoking ideas and often leads me asking questions about myself and the universe. His love of writing always shines through and he happens to be on a similar logged off embargo <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/06/28/logging-off.html">to myself</a>.</p>
<p>Writing and blogging doesn’t feel like social media. It doesn’t feel like being ‘online’ but it can come with the <a href="/2021/03/13/blogging-isnt-social.html">same trappings</a> if you get bogged down in sharing it everywhere. You have no idea what people are saying about you because no one seems to leave comments or write replies any more, if there was more interaction on the web without having to get super nerdy on the indie web then maybe we could all quit Twitter.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The past weekend we managed to grab some time away as a family. It’s been a long time coming as we booked this in March 2020, so the release to finally get away was huge. The break away wasn’t anything lavish, but even a couple of days with zero to worry about and we can enjoy some activities together was fantastic. For the long weekend I chose to not take any connective technology with me, and it can’t tell you how both weird and wonderful it felt.</p>
<p>The day we arrived whilst waiting to order some food, twice in fairly quick succession I raised my wrist to see what the time was. Only to see a faint tan line and in indent from my Apple Watch. I let out a small groan due to lacking the ability to check the time, and wondered why on earth all of my tech was at home a couple of hours drive away. I didn’t need it, I didn’t want it, yet my brain still tried to play through the tried and tested route of fixing a small period of boredom with a gadget.</p>
<p>As much as I am aware that <a href="/2020/09/09/its-not-the.html">it is not the internet that does these things to me</a>, it is becoming harder and harder to mediate them with the reliance I have of both working online and enjoying spending time connected. I am currently managing to live in an in between space where I try and limit the time I spend with gadgets, but not miss out on what they can do for me.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b8ffc36d39.jpg" width="600" height="406" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Pandemic Issues</h2>
<p>There were a few issues. When we left each other for even a small period of time, such as walking to the shop to fetch some breakfast, my wife couldn’t update me on what she needed. Of course this wasn’t a huge deal, but I also couldn’t use the NHS COVID app to track me being at several facilities, and as such felt a bit out of place. I could have done this manually, but I am not comfortable leaving my personal details on a random forms, so opted to just rely on my wife scanning the QR code.</p>
<p>All of the attractions we visited also required ordering of food and drink from a smartphone app which again I had to lean on my wife more than usual. The pandemic has placed a reliance on our connected lives and the smartness of our devices far outside the ability to contact with others. I am under <a href="/2020/08/09/i-cant-go.html">no illusions that me being without a smartphone</a> for a longer length of time just wouldn’t work out, but it’s nice to dream a little.</p>
<p>The lack of Apple Pay, messaging and everything else my phone does for me didn’t crop up  as much as I thought it would. Most obstacles could be overcome with a little thought, but having a computer in your packet is just so much easier. However the silence from my need to check social media and the reduced pocket space needed made for a much more enjoyable break away. What first was an annoyance of not being able to find out the time became something I enjoyed and instead focused on other things.</p>
<p>I have not decided when I will return yet as I am enjoying a break away for the next week. I did open Twitter today to be greeted with 13 notifications. All of which are spam to try and get me engaged in the platform again. So I swiftly closed it again. I miss it, but not in the ways I expected. It’s great to log off for a bit every now and again.</p>
<p>I might realise how much I miss it…. Perhaps.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2021/06/24/using-craft-for.html"><h1 class="p-name">Using Craft For Daily Notes</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>One of the most beneficial habits I have gotten into is taking daily notes, and I really wish I had started it earlier in life. My initial foray into Roam Research gave me the inspiration to start recording my day, simply because it is right in your face whenever you open the page. This practice has gone with me to my new home on <a href="http://www.gr36.com/2021/05/15/my-obsidian-set.html">Obsidian</a>, then a few weeks ago <a href="https://www.craft.do">Craft</a> launched something so <a href="/2021/06/03/i-love-the.html">of course I checked it out</a>.</p>
<p>Craft is a strange app that I cant really work out. When it first launched it was pitched in a strange place that didn’t quite do 100% of anything I needed. It wasn’t quite a writing app that did everything a paid app should, but had a weird wiki kind of vibe to it. I can only describe it as if Notion and <a href="/2017/01/19/bear-the-serious.html">Bear Notes</a> had a baby.</p>
<p>Having tried, and not liked very much, Craft a couple of times already, it was only the update to include daily notes that peeked my interest. While I am no stranger to jumping around apps, I wasn’t quite ready to start messing around with my set up again. However there is no harm in trying things out without getting invested and this update is a huge one.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cb564a1b6e.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>By introducing a redesigned sidebar, Craft have allowed you to separate these notes away from everything else you want to write. <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-obsidian-set/">Daily notes</a> is a practice that I preach to almost anyone that will listen, the one thing that remains from <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-to-start/">my time using Roam Research</a>. In these I record almost everything that happens during my working day, such as telephone calls, things I am thinking, interactions I have had and anything else I think I might need to refer back to later. This allows me to just get things out of my brain at the time they pop up so I can act on them later, or refer back to them if needed.</p>
<p>One thing that Craft now does really well is the ability to take meeting notes. After you have granted the app permission it will display any calendar events and allow you to start a meeting note with one click. Information from the calendar event is populated into this, and the note then shows up in the daily note and also the in app calendar. I like to distribute the notes I have made later to those that have attended, or invited so being able to do this in PDF, docx or whatever method you need is really handy. If you adopt Craft for work, you can also share these with the users you need to and even mention them in the doc itself.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5fbb18b607.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="craft-back-links">Craft Back Links</h2>
<p>Craft works with the now very popular method of back-linking meaning you can link notes together if needed and refer to them at later points. This is the real benefit of me being able to refer back to things I have recorded later on. This could be some bits of information that led to a meeting, or something as simple as an idea that I later turn into a blog post. In the screen shot above, I make a note at the end of the meeting to reference a new one set up (we usually agree on this and arrange the event in the meeting) so this then shows up when I start in the new meeting note. I can then open the note in split screen or a new tab and refer back really easily.</p>
<p>Backlinks are also really handy when building out some knowledge and making notes around topics. Amazingly handy if you are studying something, but also useful for daily life. I get ideas quite often that pop up during my morning pages that i write out when first at my desk. I can then start to link recurring topics together really easily by using <code>[[]]</code>and searching for the old note. This isn’t <em>as</em> useful as the implementation in Roam or Obsidian, but its not far away and is a little more approachable.</p>
<p>One update I would really love to see is the inclusion of unlinked references, and also improvements to the ability to search for individual block references inline. I don’t like taking my hands away from the keyboard when typing things out on morning pages, so this would be much better. However I realise that this isn’t Obsidian to I am happy to take some compromises.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/da87d3f630.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
<p>More often referred to as tasks, Craft has inbuilt checklists for you to be able to add in meeting actions in markdown or using its <code>/</code> command. Although Craft is no replacement for a task manager, you can use this as a sudo one for recording things to do. Each day will highlight any outstanding tasks next to the date. You can of course put these actions into your task manager of choice, Craft works really well with Things 3 providing a link back to the note in the tasks set up.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ea50cfc764.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>With all that said, if you intend to use the tasks inside Craft please note that there is no easy way to see all set up items in one place. The only place these are highlighted is in the daily notes. I have reached out to the developers and they <a href="https://twitter.com/craftdocsapp/status/1403255301067919360?s=20">are intending to implement this soon</a>.</p>
<p>There you have it, a very brief dalliance with daily notes in Craft. It isn’t as fleshed out as I would like but it’s pretty robust if you are going in with no expectations. I am sticking to Obsidian for the time being, but will have half an eye on any updates coming out.</p>

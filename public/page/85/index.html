     <p>eading comes easy to most of us, you pick up a book and read the words on the page. It’s so simple that almost anyone can do it in some way or another, however there are many factors that may dictate what you take away from the experience and how you consume the book. My reading pattern has changed a lot over the last few months and I have seen <a href="https://thedent.net/2020/08/10/dear-book-reading.html">a few posts</a> asking about other experiences when reading — so here is mine.</p><h2 id="books">Books</h2><p>This is kind of the most important part right, can’t read witout a book. I consume around a book a week, but sometimes much less depending on my free time. I read much more now that I have cut down my web use dramatically and consume much less TV (COVID–19 FTW).</p><p>Generally, I have two books on the go at once, sometimes more, but this will always be one fiction and one non-fiction. These are often read at different points, and used for difference things. My non-fiction books are read just before falling asleep or if I lack the ability to concentrate on much else and just want to chill out. These are usually very light reading such as the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Scott-Mariani/e/B0034O6648?ref_=dbs_p_ebk_r00_abau_000000">Ben Hope Books</a>, or something of a similar vein.</p><p>As well as this I will have a non-fiction book on the go for the times I am more alert or fancy learning something. Some of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products-ebook/dp/B00NW01MKM/ref=sr_1_11?dchild=1&amp;keywords=habbits&amp;qid=1597992860&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-11">these books</a> have kept me until ridiculous times in the morning because they are so interesting and thought-provoking — sense why I typically have two books.</p><h2 id="kindle">Kindle</h2><p>I read almost every book on my <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/amazon-kindle-oasis-8-gb-adjustable-warm-light-waterproof-graphite/dp/B07L5GDTYY">Kindle Oasis</a>. This was an expensive investment into a reader but it was worth it for me. Most people opt for the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/paperwhite?tag=googhydr-21&amp;ref=pd_sl_4s1f4ymfv4_e">Paperwhite</a>, which is exactly what I advise everyone that asks to get, and if you wait for the right time they are quite often on sale.</p><p>I would much prefer to read a paper book, they feel much better and give a tactile feedback that I really enjoy. But the books afterworlds took up too much space for me, so I wanted to be able to store loads of books in a small form that I can use where I want.</p><p>There are some books that I really want to enjoy, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bhagavad-Gita-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449183/ref=sr_1_2?crid=38X146RBBK1JA&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=bagavadgita&amp;qid=1597992296&amp;sprefix=bagava%2Caps%2C144&amp;sr=8-2">The Bhagavad Gita</a> that I purchased in paperback because I consume then very slow and numbing through a book just adds to the experience.</p><h2 id="highlighting">Highlighting</h2><p>Reading on a Kindle also offers me the ability to highlight things that I want to remember. These are usually small bits of information that display certain details of the book I am reading, things I want to look deeper into, or just great quotes. I <em>could</em> do this in a paperback, but it would be much more hassle.</p><p>Once I have finished the book, or sometimes part way through, I log into the <a href="https://read.amazon.com/notebook">Amazon notebook</a> and copy all the highlights into a book note. This is where I make my notes about the book I have read and digest the information from it. Currently, I am using <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/roam-research/">Roam Research</a> and this has made making and linking these notes together much easier than ever before. Find out more about this practice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzTOFgohiPw">here</a>.</p><p>I don’t do this for every book I read, but for most non-fiction books I usually end up highlighting some bits so this dictates if I take some notes or not. This helps me retain much more information from the book and look deeper into some topics I have discovered.</p><h2 id="pocket">Pocket</h2><p>I save all of the things on the web I want to read into Pocket. This is the best value for money app that I pay for. You can use it free, but I just want to support the apps development. In Pocket I can highlight just as I would on my Kindle and copy these into Roam if I want to store them for later.</p><p>Pocket also helps surface articles that it thinks I will like, and often does a really good job of showing me things that I enjoy. I share all of the interesting things I find on there, so you can <a href="https://getpocket.com/@f1ag8d23paKXzA52b2TRj2fT87Abp5906ePH51t767g18cg7fY10ZeePF32ZwO3b">follow me if you wish</a>.</p>

<p>I have a huge fear of missing out on productivity apps. It doesn’t matter if it is something new or a service I have tried before, if someone posts about how they use things, I have to try the thing to see if it’s better than what I currently have.</p>
<p>I try really hard to not get invested too quickly because most things revert to their previous states, but only after I have spent hours playing around with a new set up. With all that said, the excitement I felt when watching <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/a-practical-introduction-to-roam-research/">Matt Birchler’s overview of Roam Research</a> was something I have not felt in a long time.</p>
<p>After hearing a bit of hype around the launch, I initially dismissed Roam as being for academic research or more in-depth writing than I needed. But Matts video showed his use of Roam for work meetings and something clicked.</p>
<p>I won’t go into much of what it can do here, but I now finally have a note taking service that works the same way my brain does. I have often felt trapped in traditional notes apps concept of hierarchy. With notes only able to live based on their relationships to other notes or notebooks. This is true in Roam, but no note lives just because of its relationships to others, it is fluid and complex. Making it straightforward to move between notes laterally and find the information I need.</p>
<p>Be warned though — it’s ridiculously expensive.</p>

<p>On my return from holiday I bought something special, something that will allow me to work better, improve <a href="https://gr36.com/my-set-up-and-want-for-more/">my set up</a>and also enable me to work from home, but not always be at my desk.</p>
<p>Of course, I bought a MacBook Pro, and I am a little in love with the keyboard. Despite the butterfly version’s tendency <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design">to break all the time</a>, and being a little strange to get used to, I thought it was perfectly fine. I typed out hundreds of thousands of words on it with no issues (I was one of the lucky ones), but the new old version returns to proper key switches and it is brilliant to write on.</p>
<p>Couple this with the improvements in my motivation, implementing some more creative practices and writing more notes, people have already noticed more posts coming out. This new laptop hasn’t caused it, but it has certainly helped.</p>
<p>I’m not publicly <a href="https://gr36.com/today-is-the-day-i-quit-the-ipad/">quitting the iPad again</a>, more refraining from trying to fit a round peg in a square hole. The iPad is great for most things, but I use too many web tools not developed for anything other than a desktop browser, which is no fault of Apple. There are still a few quirks to iron out of iOS for me (Apple Notes still doesnt use CMD+K) but most of all, if I am being perfectly honest, I just feel more at home on macOS now.</p>
<p>My desk set up will become much slimmer, less intrusive when I am not actually working, and this thing is so powerful I can do all my design and creative work anywhere I like. We have discussed travelling a little in the next few weeks whilst still working so it is all exciting times ahead.</p>

<p>As with everything I get invested in I like to go in deep and see what it can really do. One of the easiest ways to start to mould <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/roam-research/">Roam Research</a> to your will and make it unique for your use case is to add in CSS or JS. These are two official supported ways that are easy to implement and can also be removes at your will.</p>
<h2>Roam/css</h2>
<p>You can easily change the look and feel of Roam by tweaking the CSS of the pages. This can go from a little light modding, to in-depth changes on how the layout looks.</p>
<p>To start create a page called <code>roam/css</code> and simply add in a code block that specifies css. There are a huge range of options available already created and shared on the <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/fJRcVITNY">help pages</a>. I am currently using ‘<a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/nkj1JWWS4">Better Roam Research</a>’ to add in dark mode.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to change the code block to specify css, it defaults to Clojure.</p>
<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>
<h2>Roam/js</h2>
<p>If you want to go further into Roam and really start building things that customise it to your usage then roam/js is the place to be. There are a huge number of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/hj08fl/any_good_roamjs_files/">scripts available</a> that do everything from add more buttons, to change the way Roam works in the browser.</p>
<p>To add in this capability create a page call <code>roam/js</code> or just a block with this as its only contents. Nested under this write the following. <code>{{[[roam/js]]}}</code>, this will give you the following warning.</p>
<p>It is worth paying attention to this, and only run scripts you are familiar with as there are security and safety issues to bear in mind with javascript. If you are completely sure, click “Yes, I know what I am doing” once you have nested the script you wish to use underneath. You can stop the js from running at any point by clicking “stop this”.<!--kg-card-end: html--></p>

     <p>The only thing that changes more than my task manager is my writing app. Not because I feature crave or move my blog all over the place, but because I really struggle with the environment. I love one place to store everything from short ideas, to articles to link and of course type out long essays. I don’t move often, but I certainly look at other options quite often.</p><p>So, a ‘writing app’ for me needs to be multifaceted and easy to use. It has to support markdown (that’s just how my brain works) and if possible make it easy to connect to. My current set up is none of those things but here’s why it’s the best thing I have ever found (that sounds like clickbait to me).</p><h2 id="apple-notes">Apple Notes</h2><p>My trusty notes app for collecting simple ideas and quick notes has barely changed. I have tried using the default iOS app for <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/using-apple-notes/">writing full posts too</a> and although it does OK, it just doesn’t cut it for publishing or copying posts into other apps. I use this mostly using Siri or Shortcuts to grab quick bits of information to refer to later.</p><h1 id="roam-research">Roam Research</h1><p>There are many, many things that I blame Matt Birchler for, and the vastest one of these is introducing me to this ‘app’. His excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDoOBUtxn8Q">overview of Roam</a> immediately hit home because of its powerful linking and note taking options. It isn’t a writing app at all, but has allowed me to write more than I ever have done simply by working the same way my brain does.</p><p>All of my posts start with a spark of an idea, it might be someone else’s blog post, a news article or something I have consumed during the day. Ideas jump out at me at all sorts of times and I quite often tap out the basis of a post in short bullet points of things to cover. Traditional note taking apps allow you to move between notes in a very restricted way, whereas with Roam I can use bidirectional links to string things together and notice connections I wouldn’t usually find.</p><p>I also use <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a> for gathering meeting notes, collecting together information for my day job and also writing my morning pages, so to have something that can do everything for me is something truly rare for me.</p><p>The downside of Roam is that it is expensive, and isn’t really an app per se. It’s simply a progressive web app, and so some shortcoming on mobile exist — this isn’t an issue for me, but will be for some that prefer a more native app experience.</p><h2 id="ulysses">Ulysses</h2><p>There is still nothing quite like Ulysses for fleshing out and finishing a post and hitting publish. It’s minimalistic but powerful workspace suits my needs perfectly. If Roam was my outliner and research bucket, Ulysses is where I polish the post until I am happy with it. For most posts my bullets and outlines are copied into Ulysses for me to finish off, tidy up and hit publish once ready.</p><p>That is not to say I couldn’t copy straight from Roam in markdown and publish to my blog, but I like to take the long way around. For continuity’s sake I then copy the finished article back into Roam with a blog post link incase I need to refer to it later. This keeps everything really neat and tidy. I may in future look at publishing with another app, and cut down my subscriptions costs, but currently these things fit really well together.</p>

     <p>There are many things that the current COVID-19 pandemic has destroyed. Forcing us all to readdress what is important is often painful, but also can be fulfilling if you look upon it positively. We are distant from each other like never before, we work alone and are connected only by cyberspace. We wear masks publicly and we stay at least 2meters away from everyone else.</p><p>It is a certain fear that is starting to become engrained in us, the stress of ensuring others around us are far enough away and doing as they should. Agonis ing if someone dares to step inside your distancing bubble. We wave goodbye to our friends without ever touching — and this could be the worst part of all.</p><blockquote>When we hug, our hearts connect, and we know that we are not separate beings. Hugging with mindfulness and concentration can bring reconciliation, healing, understanding, and much happiness. The practice of mindful hugging has helped so many people to reconcile with each other — fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, friends and friends, and so many others. — Nhat Hanh</blockquote><p>No longer shaking hands is one thing, but the avoidance of clutching those in an embrace takes away a deeply important part of connection. Thich Nhat Hanh recognises this in his practice of <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/01/02/sherwin-nuland-what-everybody-needs/">hugging meditation</a>. The other person becomes very real when they are in contact with you, they feel what you are expressing and experience the sensory feedback of your pressure against their skin. A level of connection and mindfulness that nothing else comes close to experiencing.</p><p>Missing embracing those around you is a natural loss, and one that we all morn. Something that we should not forget as things progress, hope is that we can return to a certain level of normalcy and hug each other once again.</p>

<p>Since picking through a few ‘self-help books’ and business related topics I read through Ryan Holidays <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ego-Enemy-Master-Greatest-Opponent-ebook/dp/B01AWUTMB0/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">Ego is the Enemy</a>. As many people that talk about the book note, I too spent the entire time reading it nodding along. Noticing traits in me and others that highlight how dangerous the Ego can be.</p>
<p>So, I sat down whilst on holiday and typed out a follow-up post about my battles with <a href="https://gr36.com/battling-ego/">ego and my desire to keep moving forward</a>. Highlighting my trait of often writing instructional posts that I don’t follow myself. Perhaps being overly critical to myself, but signing off in much better place than when I started.</p>
<p>Even though I sometimes take this ‘do as I say not as I do’ approach it can be a <a href="https://micro.blog/ChrisJWilson/10084291">rallying call to myself</a>. As much as when I write things in my morning pages advising myself what to do, it gives me something to look back on and compare to, and also myself a bit of a talking to.</p>
<p>Writing can often be cathartic and work in strange ways to help clear out thoughts in my head. Allowing me to deal with things and offer out a finality once I hit publish. If post like this don’t help <em>you</em>, they give a rallying call to myself, and that helps.</p>

<blockquote><p>One of the things I wish we could take back as a result of the web: Hype culture. I much prefer being unaware of when something is being made until it is actually done. Release dates, months-long campaigns of hype, and a laser focus on the process are all bad for our culture.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had never really thought about this until Simons post. This is a huge drain on my motivation to check out a service now, as many seem to release half baked products and then build the hype around it first before actually solving a problem.</p>
<p>Quite often the hype before launch is the only time companies can sell a serious level of products and they soon disappear into nothingness. Marketing and bluster can only get you so far, but its annoying while it lasts.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>For the past two decades there has been a battle to collect as much information about you as possible. Data centres are filled full of so much of your data that they could make a pretty accurate copy of your inner workings. This has been so blatant and marketed so well that many people think it has to be done to get the most out of technology – and feel powerless to do anything else.</p>
<p>There is a level of acceptance for personal privacy that is written off as the price of entry to the internet. With a general consensus that you must give over your data to get the most out of tools, and reap the benefits of what the World Wide Web has to offer. Google joins the dots between your browsing, email and search history and ties this all back to your personal account. All in the name of serving you better ads.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We really want to combat people’s learned helplessness in privacy. Everyone’s concerned, but a large percentage of people just think there’s nothing you can really do about it. We want to prove that you can do something.” – <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/duckduckgo-android-choice-screen-search">Gabriel Weinberg, CEO DuckDuckGo</a></p></blockquote>
<p>It is completely up to you if you value the data you exchange for goods and services that internet companies provide you. Google and Facebook are two of the worst but certainly not the only ones. Google in exchange for your data gives you a suite of free tools and apps that many find impossible to live without. Google search for instance, is so dominant because it knows so much information about you and tailors results to those that you want to see, rolling this into Google assistant, maps and all of its other services just for good measure.</p>
<p>Sounds like a great trade to many, because it depends on how much value you put on companies knowing all about you. Pichai can side step all the questions in the world by insisting that “most of the data we collect is to help users and provide personalised experiences back” but the reality is that the more data they get about you, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/googles-sundar-pichai-grilled-over-destroying-anonymity-on-the-internet/">more money they make</a>.</p>
<p>A personal data exhange should not be viewed as the price to get better tools, there are many <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">other options out there for users</a>, but they just don’t know about them. In many cases Google controls the services you use, the websites you see and even the browser you use. You’re not using the open internet, you are using a limited Google web that pushes their services on you.</p>
<p>Giving away your data only helps one thing and that is the companies bottom line.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>After spending some time setting up <a href="https://gr36.com/post-films-watched-micropub/">posting films to micropub</a>, I really wanted to get my reading sorted. There are great options out there like <a href="https://indiebookclub.biz/">indiebookclub</a> – but I wanted to automate it and make it possible every time I finish a book on my kindle.</p>
<p>With nothing fitting the bill I delved into the API (which is pretty good by the way) and came up with a solution. It relies on a developer key from Goodreads so I don’t promise how long this will work, they could pull this or remove your access to it at any point.</p>
<h2>Developer Key</h2>
<p>Goodreads will let anyone <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys">set up a developer key</a> for access to their API, all you need to add are a few details about yourself and agree to the developer terms. If you break these terms, they are well within their right to stop you using the service – so please read them.</p>
<p>Once agreed, you will need the top part labeled ‘key’ – keep this safe and don’t share it with anyone as it gives access to all of your information and you can read/write to your Goodreads account with it. A full list of API abilities are available <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/api">here</a>.</p>
<p>From here I researched what is available through the API and discovered you can pull books you have read from the following feed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/[ID].xml?key=[key]&amp;shelf=read
</code></pre>
<p>I have focused on updating micro.pub whenever I finish a book, but you can find extra information about books in your shelf by chaining after the <code>&amp;</code> to be <code>currently-reading</code> or <code>to-read</code>.</p>
<h2>IFTTT</h2>
<p>Once you have this information it is pretty easy to set up a posting trigger in your service of choice. IFTTT is completely free so is a win straight off the bat, but as a caveat is a little more complex to set up and I found a little limited to work with. This is personal preference, of course, but IFTTT is still very straight forward to set up.</p>
<p>Click on Create and chose RSS as your IF (the trigger), choose new item in feed and paste in your RSS feed. The Then (action) part is a Webhook to allow you to post to micropub services. For this example, I am going to run through micro.blog, but they all will all be pretty much the same.</p>
<p>Make a web request, and then put in the URL of your service, in this case it is <code>https://micro.blog/micropub</code>. Method is POST and content type is usually application/x-form-url-encoded. In the body you need two bits of information, an access code and what you want the post to display. This will be dependent on your service but in my micro.blog case I use the following.</p>
<p><code>access_token=ABCDEF&amp;content={{EntryContent}}&amp;name={{ItemTitle}}</code></p>
<p>With the access token generated in the setting of my micro.blog.</p>
<p>You can customise the body content to whatever you want to display in the post. If you leave this as is, then it will display the raw content of the RSS feed.</p>
<h2>Zapier</h2>
<p>This is a much more rounded service that makes it much easier to customise the post content, but at a cost of £20 per month. For this cost, you get the ability to automate many more things, so it might be worth considering but please bear this in mind.</p>
<p>Start by creating a new Zap, the trigger is RSS and the event is a new item in the feed. Paste in the RSS feed you have saved and that is all you need to do on this step as you don’t need any information to access this feed. On the next step Zapier will find the data — so make sure you’ve at least read one book, and then pull everything into Zapier.</p>
<p>The action is Webhooks, and the action event needs to be POST to tell micropub to post information. By customising the request you can go as deep as you like, this is where Zapier makes it so easy to post images, ratings and everything the feed contains effortlessly and understandably. To do this put the Micropub url into the first box, in my case this is <code>https://micro.blog/micropub</code> and leave the Payload type as Form.</p>
<p>Click the plus sign under Data, and type <code>content</code> into the first box, and then you can customise the post until your heart is content. Click the plus button again and type <code>access_token</code> into the first box and in the second one copy in an access code from micro.blog. Your service may not require this, but will usually require some kind of authentication.</p>
<p>All the other topics can remain as they are by default, by clicking continue you are given the option to test the post. Do this and check that everything appears correctly — you can always go back and change things before re-testing. This is another option that makes Zapier a great service to work with. Once you’re happy, finish everything off and now every time you finish a book it will post to Micropub.</p>

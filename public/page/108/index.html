  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Ding! One new post incoming.</p>
<p>I think everyone will agree notifications from your technology are annoying. Yet everyone puts up with them to a point where it’s just a haze of buzzing, beeping and dinging that rings in your ears for your entire waking hours. I have <a href="https://www.byodpodcast.com/episodes/episode-1-renders-of-leaks-of-lies/30/4/2017" rel="nofollow">talked quite a bit</a>about being engaged with the world and notifications are my next assault.</p>
<p>For the past couple of weeks I have been experimenting with tuning out all non essential notifications. Unfortunately the iPhone doesn’t have a notification system that is as intelligent as Android, but it allows for some tuning and minimisation. However this extends to tablets, computers and my favourite bit of technology smartwatches.</p>
<h2>The Apple Watch</h2>
<p>Previously a big advocate of the Apple Watch, the wrist strapped device has allowed me to be more engaged and silence my phone more often. Yet the action of checking my watch when it taps me on the wrist is almost a greater social faux pars than glancing at a phone.</p>
<p>Smart watches are more of a balance than other equipment in use. On one hand it allows the accompanying phone to be on silent much of the time and interruption for only important notifications. Yet on the other its a piece of technology strapped to your wrist for the sole purpose of solving a problem that is easier solved.</p>
<h2>Notification tuning</h2>
<p>This is a movement I want more users to be aware of, notifications are easy to control and manage straight from your handset. Only you can decide what you need to see, if you need it to beep, or if its important to you. Personally social media notifications are turned off for me, as are pointless app such as games and shopping apps.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/751a770039.jpg" alt="2017 10 23 notification screenshots 1" title="2017-10-23-notification-screenshots-1.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="412" />These types of apps have a tendency to pop up notifications for little reason other than to get you engaged with the app again. Attention is the commodity the trade from and sell it to advertisers. If there is nothing important the app can tell you, switch them firmly to off!</p>
<p>The rest is up to you, experiment with what you need interrupting your life. Despite you t<a href="http://www.adweek.com/digital/needy-technology-too-many-notifications-causes-users-to-tune-out/" rel="nofollow">hinking that it doesn’t affect</a> you it’s surprising how much calmer and happier your life becomes from seeing less pointless information.</p>
<p>The only issue with this approach is the possibility of gameify your notifications. Constantly checking the app to see if you have any notifications. There is no way around overcoming this, the apps and screens we use are <a href="https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/what-is-technology-doing-to-us" rel="nofollow">specifically designed to keep us engaged</a> in them. Hopefully sanity will prevail and you will quickly realise that many of you beeps and dings are simply not useful to you.</p>
<p>There also needs to be some realisation from a user that it is also quite arrogant to think you need to answer every notification straight back. Not only in the self created bubble where you think that you are so important enough to warrant an immediate reply. Also that picking your phone up in the middle of being engaged in something else is amazingly annoying.</p>
<p>Without getting too critical and socially scolding this issues is almost socially accepted now. We all have a story of observing others who are too engrossed in another activity to be aware of what is around them. Yet the haze will continue until more people cut out the noise.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Since just before Christmas I’ve been questioning many things in my life and making improvements wherever I can. Not due to anything in particular, simply an attempt to make myself happier and more engaged with life. This has lead me to some great places. I have been <a href="https://medium.com/simple-words/me-meditating-yeah-right-be7ae66f1c5">meditating</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/simple-words/social-media-and-my-mind-77ade3309982">cutting down my social media use</a> and for the most part <a href="https://medium.com/simple-words/turn-the-phone-over-c72b99cbb58a">cutting down my phone usage</a>. Not only for the benefit of me, but also for the benefit of the people around me.</p><p>Around a month ago I made the decision to ditch my pocket busting iPhone 7 plus, and downsize. In fact I opted for something significantly smaller, an iPhone SE. The amount of questions I have received is quite shocking, but the answer to anyone wondering why, is both long and complicated.</p><p>I went into a reasonable amount of detail on an episode of the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/byod_podcast/episode02">Bring your own device podcast</a>. Which covers much of my feelings around my smartphone. This ultimately devolves into two parts. The first of which is why an iPhone SE and the second is why bother.</p><h3 id="why-an-se">Why an SE?</h3><p>Well I’m not adverse to using a smaller phone, I used an iPhone 5s (that is still in my draw) for quite a while. Yet I wanted the whole experience, I didn’t want to loose Apple Pay and the better camera so an iPhone SE seemed ideal. Couple with this the fact that the SE doesn’t seem to have maintained its resale value like other iPhones, I managed to pick up a 64gb version for just £200.</p><p>The IPhone SE is an amazing handset, especially given the price point that I picked it up for. It keeps all of the build quality, attention to detail and ability, yet reduces the strain on my pocket and my mind. However it is not all good news, there are some compromises to using something that is a few years old now. I miss the iPhone 7 new style home button, regular buttons now feel archaic, and the hardware is far from perfect. This most obvious of which is the low resolution screen and the battery life.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/d2005f6876.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><h3 id="why-bother">Why bother</h3><p>The real answer is very complicated, so strap yourself in for a bumpy ride. It’s going to get very preachy and very weird for someone so engrained in technology like myself. The reasons for which are not to dissimilar to my feelings surrounding <a href="https://medium.com/simple-words/the-dangers-of-being-a-phonehobo-d1db2fabd31a">not becoming an phonehobo</a>.</p><p>Currently the smartphone is both bringing us together and tearing us apart. That is not a local issue, it is a human problem, the smartphone is coming between human interaction is a huge way. We are not the humans from Wall-E on big floating chairs yet, but scientific research says we are not far away.</p><p>Research <a href="http://www.academia.edu/4661907/The_effect_of_smart_phones_on_social_interaction">tells us that the sheer presence of a smartphone</a> make interaction less meaningful for both parties and gives the illusion of neither party being engaged. It changes the very ideas we form when interacting and changes them for the worst. This is not a debatable occurrence, it is undeniable consequence of having this equipment around.</p><p>The fact is that most people won’t care, but when I am also responsible for two young kids that should feel my engagement with them as much as I do, then it is an issue for more than just myself.</p><p>I remember a time when I was mad that an Android phone I was testing didn’t get more than 4 hours screen on time. Even in a week that’s more than a whole day just staring at my phone. If moving from 5.5inches down to just 4” forces me to use my phone less, it’s a win for everyone.</p><p>The consequence of having a much smaller screen on my phone is that my phone is now a phone and not a computer in my pocket. The motivation, if not simply the ability, for me to do things on my phone is almost completely removed. I am much happier with a smaller phone, and I am not alone making this switch – give it a try and you might find the same.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>There can’t be many iOS or Mac app for note taking that I still haven’t tried. As soon as I’ve reviewed an app, gone through all the setting up process and made a choice to switch, I start looking around for other apps. I have a major fear of missing out on something that could be a better fit. Truth be told it costs me a fortune, subscription services or expensive one off payments seem to be normal now – but not with Zoho Notebook.</p>
<p>Notebook by Zoho is completely free, with a promise for it to always to remain so. There are no adverts, no add ons and nothing to pay – ever. That’s a big promise but the costs of supporting the app are maintained by the developers other projects. They make a lot of other products, but have a huge aim for this one, for it to be the best!</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-10-24-zoho-search-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0b09635ff2.jpg" alt="2017 10 24 zoho search 1" width="596" height="68" border="0" />Zoho set their stall out early and <a href="https://www.zoho.com/notebook/evernote-alternative.html">advertise themselves as a free Evernote alternative</a>. “Looking for an alternative to Evernote? we can’t blame you” sits proudly on their webpage, indicating very early their intentions. They truly believe Notebook is a much better app, available for free with “roughly 80% of Evernote’s features”. Notebook is available for iOS and Android with a <a href="https://www.zoho.com/notebook/notebook-for-mac.html">companion Mac app</a> should you wish to work on desktop to. This includes a safari plug in for working with webpages, unfortunately there is no web access as yet.</p>
<p>An app for Windows is also missing, so this can’t be considered truly multi platform and offer everything Evernote does. Although with that said the Mac app is a relatively new addition, missed from several reviews so it may come in the future. The Mac app also support the 2016 MacBook Pro Touch Bar, so you can tap through shortcuts and also secure your notes with Touch ID as you can on an iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p>They also promise that they will never, in contrast to Evernote, look at your notes or information. There is a conflicting back and forth whenever this is discussed, however if that practice is a concern of yours then Zoho is the place to go first. Bare in mind also that sync is provided by their own servers and not iCloud so there is a small compromise to be made.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-10-24-zoho-screenshot-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/81544cb9fc.jpg" alt="2017 10 24 zoho screenshot 1" width="599" height="398" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong><strong>Design</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The Evernote comparisons don’t just end with the applications intentions either. It is clear where they get the inspiration from, but if I’m allowed to be somewhat subjective they do a much better job of it. Notebook is often considered one of the <a href="https://gr36.com/zoho-notebook-review/thenextweb.com/apps/2016/07/13/zoho-notebook-prettiest-note-taking-mobile-app-youll-ever-use/?amp=1">best looking notes apps you will come across</a>, and I couldn’t disagree. The design and layout of every option is well thought through, if a little minimalistic. Great design is something that can become increasingly difficult when your app does as much as this one.</p>
<p>The main display of the app takes its inspiration from physical notebooks. Allowing users to split notes into different books based on whatever you wish. This could be the purpose of the note, or a category of your choosing. You can then customise these with its own front cover from a large selection and display the notebook to your own liking.</p>
<p>This is a design choice I have consciously stayed away from with other apps in the past and much prefer a traditional notes app display. There is no way to tag notes or display them on any other way than one notebook or another. This took a little getting used to, and feels a little strange. It is also worth noting that even on the iPhone 7 plus there is no landscape layout which is more than a little annoying.</p>
<p>Inside the Notebooks are your actual notes, displayed either by date or alphabetically. These are customisable with different background colours, although these can only be defined after creation. You can create simple text notes, but also drawings, voice memos and checklists. The display of the note is tailored for the note type, so audio is playable and images are very visible.</p>
<p>The four options to start a note are a little confusing at first, and it should be questioned if they are really needed. Notebook has the ability for a note to contain multiple note types, but you must start with a text note. So there is no ability to add text to a voice memo. Zoho should consider implementing a similar approach to OneNote and treat all notes the same, this would offer a much more understandable experience.</p>
<p>If you like to scribble down your thoughts handwritten notes are one of the most pleasurable things about Notebook. The developers have taken great care in making sure your quick doodles or jotted notes are taken care of. This works very well with the Apple Pencil, although you can use any stylus or indeed your finger if required.</p>
<p>There is nothing worse than spending ages looking for the note you previously made and Zoho does everything they can to make notes easy to find. There is no OCR on hand written notes unfortunately so search will only include your text notes but will search through all notebooks with perfect results on each version of the app.</p>
<p>You can also snap pictures, clip webpages and even add a full article into here – particularly handy if you read lots of webpages or store ideas all into one notebook.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-10-24-zoho-clipper-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e5b2cadc25.jpg" alt="2017 10 24 zoho clipper 1" width="600" height="413" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong><strong>Web Clipper</strong></strong></h2>
<p>One of the standout features of Notebook is their <a href="https://www.zoho.com/notebook/web-clipper.html">web clipper</a>, which is something that every app with at least some enterprise ambitions must include. You’re able to easily clip text, images and also entire articles and save them to your included unlimited storage.</p>
<p>When clipping a webpage there is an inbuilt option to clear the page of everything other than the article. Which removes those pesky ads and videos we all hate. This option could help some eliminate a read it later service or a long list of bookmarks. It works surprisingly well, equal to that of Pocket or Instapaper removing all adverts but also images. Although it lacks some customisation for reading options such as font type so couldn’t completely replace an offline reader for pure functionality.</p>
<p>However Notebook <em><em>could</em></em> very easily replace a service such as Pinterest for saving ideas around any subject all in one place.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Zoho Notebook Verdict</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The app is missing out on too many features for <em><em>my</em></em> personal use, but I do wonder how many people pay for a service such as Evernote and would be perfectly fine with this app. However there are some things missing to truly complete with the large services people use.</p>
<p>Much of my cons with the app are related to my specific use case. I would love to see a tagging and labelling system rather than based on traditional books. There is no way for me to add a note to more than one book, which might seems strange but some of my text needs to be displayed in multiple places.</p>
<p>There is also no collaboration or sharing available within the app with sync only provided by their own servers. Notes are not kept in iCloud or Dropbox so your pretty much locked into the service once started. There is also no URL scheme support available which is detrimental to my Workflow and therefore iPad usage.</p>
<p>With that said this new upstart in an already very crowded area is a welcome addition. If you <em><em>are</em></em> looking for something free, easy to use and with simple features there is no point looking anywhere else than here or <a href="http://www.gr36.com/google-keep-as-a-writing-tool/">perhaps Google Keep</a>. The future looks very promising for Zoho Notebook as this is still a new app in development, so I will be keeping an eye on them with interest.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>I know, I know I’m calling for Siri to get better again. Yet nothing has brought the downfalls of Apples voice assistant to the forefront than spending some time using Apples new AirPods. There has always been issues with using Siri and granted Apple are working hard at <a title="An Exclusive Look at How AI and Machine Learning Work at Apple" href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWrP_V5dTSAhWE5xoKHZzMCc0QFggsMAI&amp;url=https://backchannel.com/an-exclusive-look-at-how-ai-and-machine-learning-work-at-apple-8dbfb131932b&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8hMDNtNSohTpPBzNPtSfy29JzBQ&amp;sig2=RiS8nvxuJHA9--fE2b0avw">fixing and improving things</a>, but Apple are now so far behind others is it possible to catch up?</p>
<p>Truth be told I have never been a huge user of Siri, it was great to show your friends when Siri was first released with the iPhone 4s. I even gave it another shot when I could just yell “hey Siri” at <a title="Use Siri on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch - Apple Support" href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB8qrm5NTSAhUEnRoKHUmsBswQFggcMAA&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204389&amp;usg=AFQjCNGS_TIe4zlbW4Rl9b2oPKyxI2nR4A&amp;sig2=v258Ui_ux9QaFqoBw1oK5A">my phone after installing iOS 9</a>. Nevertheless it almost always devolves into an argument with myself, at which point I pull out my phone and simply tap away like some kind of cave man. Some personal assistant you are.</p>
<p>Siri being a dumb ass isn’t really the issue. The improved microphones found in the AirPods, coupled with the fact they are next to your face, means voice recognition is actually pretty good. The problem is in fact that Siri can’t do half the things users need from an assistant – and isn’t actually useful.</p>
<p>This is none more obvious when you use anything other than Apples own apps that come with iOS. Apple may have given users the opportunity of deleting their apps, and finally ridding yourself of Stocks and Voice Memos – but iOS still tries to use them at every turn.</p>
<p>Want to take a note in <a title="Bear: The Serious Notes App" href="http://www.gr36.com/bear-the-serious-notes-app/">the brilliant Bear app instead</a>, nope. I’m putting a note in an app you don’t use titled ‘Bear’. Think you can dictate an email to Siri to send in AirMail – you’ve got another think coming.</p>
<p>Why make all of these things possible if only half of that is actually true? Apple made the AirPods so reliant on voice that there is no other way to change the volume levels, yet didn’t think the whole thing through. Most users no doubt wouldn’t even dream of using anything other than Apple mail, Notes or Reminders but Siri is so dumb it doesn’t even know the apps are gone. That is until it pauses for a few seconds like a puppy wanting to know where the magic stick has gone; only to realise it’s behind your back.</p>
<p>Returning not with what you asked for but a solemn “I’m sorry I can’t do that”. Well what actually <strong>CAN</strong> you do Siri because I can’t find much past turning my music up.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2017/02/19/one-year-of.html"><h1 class="p-name">One year of the iPad Pro as my computer</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The shocked look when I tell people that my primary computing device is an iPad is brilliant. I’ve actually been working on an iPad for a little over two years, and have replaced pretty much all of my computing with an iPad. First with an iPad Air 2 and now with a 9.7” iPad Pro.</p>
<p>With pretty much the same argument to working on a Chromebook, people are too eager to dismiss the iPad as a computer. When the truth is it’s actually pretty easy. With a little investment in software and some time invested in setting things up the way that suits you best. You can do. Out of your daily tasks with little thought, but dig in deep and you can do 99% of your requirements on one device.</p>
<p>Quite a few of my <a href="http://darylbaxter.com/">friends have adopted the same approach</a> now the iPad has a great keyboard case, and use it as I do. Unfortunately most people don’t want to put in the time and are often dismissive, however I really think more people should embrace the iPad as a computer.</p>
<h2><strong>Apps to do anything</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s be honest, as great as iOS10 is there are still holes in Apples OS. Thankfully most of these are filled by the rich app ecosystem. I have spent far too much money on apps over the years, and unfortunately most of the expense has been on apps that I no longer use. Reviewing the use case of new apps, trying things out and experimenting. Only for it ultimately to fall short in some area, not meet my needs or very often become superseded by something better.</p>
<p>I never have many apps on my iPad, but what I do have installed are used often. I made the mistake very early on of carrying around a replica of my iPhone on a bigger scale, but quickly realised there is no need. Both devices have completely different uses and should be treated as such. Don’t flood your iPad with social and communication apps unless you intend to use them often.</p>
<p>With that all said there are a few apps I can’t do without:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workflow</li>
<li>Ulysses</li>
<li>Notes – <a href="http://www.gr36.com/2017-01-19-bear-app-review/">now replace by Bear</a></li>
<li>Documents</li>
<li>Medium</li>
<li>Pocket</li>
<li>Notability</li>
<li>Day One</li>
<li>Linky<br />
These apps are the ones used daily, when writing or reading. I have a lot of media apps for watching movies or TV shows at the gym or while traveling, but your use case will vary. I will not go into extensive details about everything I use, but give you a shallow overview, if you want to dig in deep check out <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/working-on-the-ipad-one-year-later-still-my-favorite-computer/">MacStories second update on</a> using an iPad Pro.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Automation</strong></h2>
<p>This is where almost everyone I speak to falls off and sticks to more traditional means. Maybe it’s because things are easier, maybe it’s muscle memory, maybe there isn’t a real reason, but users fall by the wayside quite early. However with a little work and research you can pretty much achieve anything you need from a computer and often make it much more straight forward.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a74515050d.jpg" alt="Ipad pro workflow 1" title="ipad-pro-workflow-1.png" border="0" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h3><strong>Workflow</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/workflow-powerful-automation-made-simple/id915249334?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4">Workflow is not complicated</a> nor confusing it just takes a little time investment and reading to get the hang of it. I’ve been using the app for more than a year and it is the best app I have ever bought, it is the cornerstone of much of my productivity.</p>
<p>Think of Workflow as Automator for iOS, plugging into countless (but not every) app and making things much easier. It works by creating recipes by dropping actions together. You can then feed information into the recipe, ‘run’ them and get your desired outcome.</p>
<p>I have invested time in making Workflow recipes or finding <a href="https://workflow.directory/">them in other people’s blogs</a> and making them my own. They do all sorts of things for me, from resizing images for publishing to wrapping my screenshots in device frames and stitching images together.</p>
<p>My most used of which isn’t my own work but I have modified it slightly for use on my blog. Jordan Merrill created a screenshot builder for you to easily import into your own set up, the full guide is easy to follow and can be <a href="https://www.jordanmerrick.com/posts/screenshot-builder-workflow/">found here</a>. You can also achieve a similar result using the <a href="https://appsto.re/gb/42_C2.i">app LongScreen</a>, select your screenshot and tap the magic wand at the bottom.</p>
<p>I also use several workflows for resizing images for my featured image sizes and also <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/b4f8cf8ce27841b2a5624d84c83d7d3a">combining my device images together</a>. However these are only a small selection of workflows that I use, over the last year or so I have built up an armoury of resources. Allowing me to adapt or create recipes for many of my daily tasks.</p>
<p>There would be no point sharing many of these as they would be unique to my image sizes etc, but they are pretty easy to create with a few minutes digging in. If you are serious about using Workflow there is no better resource than the <a href="https://club.macstories.net/">Club MacStories newsletter</a>, for the small subscription you get access to all of the content created from which there are hundreds of ideas.</p>
<h2><strong>Notes, words and writing</strong></h2>
<p>The title of this post started of as “running my blog from an iPad” because that is exactly what I do. I spend most of my time writing on my iPad or digesting what I am about to write. I have used many apps over the years, starting on Google Docs, graduating to the markdown editor Byword. I now use the amazing if a little expensive Ulysses app.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c2d13a3591.jpg" alt="Ipad pro ulysses 1" title="ipad-pro-ulysses-1.png" border="0" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h3><strong>Ulysses</strong></h3>
<p>There must already be millions of words already written about Ulysses, it is considered the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ulysses/id623795237?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4">pro wiring app on Mac</a> and only relatively recently <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ulysses/id950335311?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4">came across to iOS</a>. I resisted for a long time purely down to price, and the fact that at the time Byword was a perfectly good Markdown editor. Yet the move was smooth and a very rewarding one.</p>
<p>The deciding factor was publishing. Ulysses allows me to see exactly how an article will look before publishing. Although publishing to WordPress is available from a few different apps, compatibility and preview where always not quite right. Meaning I had to use the a webpage or god forbid the awful WordPress app to correct things. Whereas I can input local images into a document and they will be uploaded along with all of the text.</p>
<p>Organisation and syncing in Ulysses is also second to none, allowing for articles written on any device I own, syncing to all and organised exactly as I wish. Most other Markdown apps use an iCloud folder sync that can be slow and very unreliable. Not to mention that dumping all of the files in one folder means trying to find an old file can be a nightmare.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c0b0f9c3f2.jpg" alt="Ipad pro bear 1" title="ipad-pro-bear-1.png" border="0" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h3><strong>Bear</strong></h3>
<p>The regular old stock Notes app that has been my place to store everything has recently been replaced with Bear. By calling Bear a notes app it is much more approachable. When in reality it is a Markdown editor at heart. Allowing you to add in formatting while typing, for sharing later or simply for your own use. With a couple of key strokes you can add in links, headings, tick boxes, and even images.</p>
<p>Bear has been expertly designed in both aesthetics and function. All of your notes are listed on the left hand menu, which can be accessed with a right swipe. Once you are editing or looking at a note the developers have made all of the formation options available in a shortcut bar above the keyboard. This sounds a simple thing to do, but lots of others hide these away behind a formatting menu.</p>
<p>I have slotted Bear in between my current writing app of choice, Ulysses, and my brain. It gives me the ability to format and position text in a small light weight app before moving them to Ulysses for images and publishing.</p>
<p>I also use Notability quite often for hand written notes, these are usually more work related than writing but there is something really great about hand writing notes. The Apple Pencil also allows me to jot down things if the mood strikes me, although I have found myself not using these as often as I expected. Should the new iPad Pro be launched with a new Apple Pencil I will think twice about punching it as this just isn’t what I have used my iPad for, although many people use it daily.</p>
<h2><strong>Documents app as a document picker</strong></h2>
<p>The cry from those dismissive of a productive iOS user is that you can’t do anything without a file system. Unfortunately in the past this may have been true, but since iOS 8 users have been able to do much more and very easily. The introduction of iCloud Drive with iOS 10 is the closest users have come to a file system, and is already proving to be really useful.</p>
<p>Not only because syncing of documents is much easier, with far more file types supported. With this has come syncing from a mac computer of all users documents into ‘the cloud’. Meaning working from anywhere is possible, whatever you are doing there is a wealth of apps out there to help.</p>
<p>With that said the major upside to making the ‘drive’ part of iCloud more accessible has been allowing apps to use the storage area to manage files much better. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/documents-5-file-manager-pdf-reader-and-browser/id364901807?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4">Documents by Readle</a> is an essential app for users wanting to work with specific files and be productive.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cfa3c836d9.jpg" alt="Ipad pro documents 1" title="ipad-pro-documents-1.jpg" border="0" width="597" height="181" />This plugs in perfectly with PDF expert, which is an essential if you work with PDF like I do. I can open, read, edit or sign documents and email them back. Whereas in the past I would have to print off pages, to then scan them back onto a file again.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to use iCloud, or you have to use storage elsewhere then Documents can grab documents from Dropbox, Google drive, Box, One Drive and almost everywhere else including an FTP server. The design could do with an update, but it is functional and works perfectly – which is exactly what’s needed.</p>
<p>Documents can manage almost any file type, allowing users to open, edit and send them inside the app. It even allows you to download and extract zip archives from web links using an internal browser. File management is still not desktop class, but I would argue that it really doesn’t need to be. Ask yourself what you actually need to do with the files on your desktop or laptop and I would say 70% of that can be done on iOS.</p>
<h2><strong>Medium and reading</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve been publishing everything for the past year or so to Medium. My personal blog, tech stuff and also posts that I’ve started writing about my daughter and her life with a disability. When I first decided to do this, Medium was fresh and new, with a growing reputation of the place to be. I loved that they had control about how things looked, not only because I didn’t have to work maintaining and managing a theme for the site, but also because everything looked the same.</p>
<p>It was a place I went to read things, and so did many many other people. Open the app and there was a wealth of available content that was relevant to what you like. Medium expanded my reach to people that had no idea about my website, but perhaps read the same sort of things as I produce. I let their trusty algorithm serve up my posts to people it felt would read it. A win on all sides whichever way you looked at it.</p>
<p>Even though this has changed over the last few months there is still lots of interesting articles that people publish to the platform, it is a staple app for digesting content. The iPad app is also a really nice writing app to publish from, even though I use Ulysses the Medium app stands up pretty well it terms of usage.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f9699356bc.jpg" alt="Ipad pro dayone 1" title="ipad-pro-dayone-1.png" border="0" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h2><strong>Journaling on Day one</strong></h2>
<p>For the last couple of years I have gone backwards and forwards with journaling, both in the digital and physical sense. I am no longer writing in here, although it is a great app if you want to write and even publish a blog from here. My usage is as a scrap book to store links to everything I write and pictures I post.</p>
<p>Along with IFTTT recipes I have stored everything I post for every website I write for, and also Instagram photos. As I produce more and more content on the digital web Day One keeps a record of all this, dated and linked for me to look back on.</p>
<h2><strong>Pocketing things to read later</strong></h2>
<p>The reason my iPad is so useful to me is because I can fold it out into a writing device with keyboard and tap away until my hearts content. I can do this for hours with great battery life and then simply fold it up and slip it into a small sleeve in my bag. Yet the greatest thing is pulling the keyboard off and just relaxing, reading a book or more often than not catching up on my <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pocket-save-articles-and-videos-to-view-later/id309601447?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4">reading list in Pocket</a> .</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/05ad76678c.jpg" alt="Ipad pro pocket 1" title="ipad-pro-pocket-1.png" border="0" width="600" height="300" />I have gone backwards and forward with read it later services over the last few weeks, but in reality there is only two to be considered. Pocket or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4">Instapaper</a>, it is that simple. I recently switched away to Instapaper, and even <a href="http://www.gr36.com/how-to-move-from-pocket-to-instapaper/">wrote a guide on how to do it easily</a>, but after some issues with Instapaper syncing I’m back using Pocket. The social sharing and also the recommended articles are a great service where you can discover things that may have slipped you by.</p>
<p>Setting this up with IFTTT recipes for sharing is dead easy, and you can even follow your social media friends to see what they are recommending and widen your reading circle.</p>
<h2><strong>Sharing with Linky</strong></h2>
<p>I discovered Linky <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/linky-adds-a-more-powerful-share-sheet-to-ios-8/">completely by chance whilst looking</a> for something to share links on a business twitter account I manage. This simple app is one of the most straight forward but yet the most confusing if you dive straight in. In broad terms it is a share sheet app that allows easy sharing of information to multiple accounts on social mediate in recent updates it has gained lots more features.</p>
<p>When opening the app you are greeted with nothing but a browser, yet its real power comes from the share sheet. This is indispensable to me for sharing to more than one twitter account, but also for clearing Apple News links! This caught me out several times when sharing interesting articles, meaning people on other platforms cannot read them, nor can people that have removed the app.</p>
<p>When sharing from inside Apple News Linky will find the regular link and share that instead.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/92cd4e9ae7.jpg" alt="Ipad pro linky 1 1" title="ipad-pro-linky-1-1.jpg" border="0" width="599" height="241" /></p>
<h2><strong>Can’t Do’s</strong></h2>
<p>Unfortunately the iPad just cant do everything, there are some things that a desktop type browser is essential and no amount of mediating with Documents will work. This ranges from simple things such as options and menus not appearing on mobile safari version of web pages. Right the way through to recording audio whilst taking part in a podcast.</p>
<p>These types of things crop up in the most annoying places, such as my resent adventure <a href="http://www.gr36.com/how-to-move-from-pocket-to-instapaper/">moving from Pocket to Instapaper</a>. There are also gaps in the armoury that is provided by the App Store to. For example the desktop version of Garadgeband is a great app for editing podcast audio, yet the iPad app doesn’t even entertain the idea.</p>
<p>There is still no option for these few very important use case of mine. So sitting in front of a Mac is still unavoidable for some tasks. Although these issues are decreasing more and more over time. Using an iPad is less about computing power and more about versatility. Perhaps this is the reason many Windows laptop have taken the convertible route? I am more than certain we will never see a convertible macOS device, but we already have a brilliant iOS one.</p>
<h2><strong>Using an iPad</strong></h2>
<p>As more and more people realise that much of what they need to do on a ‘computer’ can be done on less traditional hardware the world changes. The frustration is users being put off by media commentary before they have ever tried using one, the same headlines written by tech blogs are regurgitated by end users. I see the same people argue that you can’t work on an iPad are many of the same supporting the use of a Chromebook.</p>
<p>I would challenge everyone to find many use cases where you can’t use an iPad for most of your computing tasks. The iPad offers unrivalled battery life for usage whilst traveling, combined with something that is lighter than any laptop available.</p>
<p>The OS and extensive suite of apps in many ways are more capable and straight forward than a desktop OS. If you want to make the most of using your iPad as a computer, it doesn’t have to be an iPad Pro at all. Yet you will need to spend a bit of time deciding what you want to use it for, and open your mind to the possibility.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’m starting to think I have a problem, I just can’t leave things alone. Once I find a great app that does what I need, I write the review and then start looking at other options.</p>
<p>Days after finding <a href="http://www.gr36.com/bear-the-serious-notes-app/">Bear to write everything from short notes to full posts</a> I was eyeing up other Notes apps. I decided to give Google Keep a try and it is actually pretty good. Not really as a notes app, but for reminders and todo lists.</p>
<p>I’m sure it makes a very good notes app for those quick little notes you occasionally need. The whole UI is based around post it notes after all, yet it doesn’t hold a candle to other notes apps in terms of features.</p>
<p>You can attach images, voice notes and URL’s but only one per note. Users can also forget about any kind of formatting or inline linking, but these features don’t feature in the stock iOS app either. It is only third party options, that usually come at a premium, that leave Google Keep in their wake. With all that said it does everything <em><em>most</em></em> people will need to do. Doing the simple things very well indeed and syncing notes to iOS, Android and the web.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a87972beab.jpg" alt="Google keep screenshots 1" title="google-keep-screenshots-1.png" border="0" width="599" height="398" />Google are great at keeping everything simple and easy to understand, doing a great job with the Keep app. Everything is controlled from a left hand menu accessed using the ‘hamburger’ icon in the top left. The design is very Googley, using their own material design but still following an iOS familiarity. The design won’t be to everyone taste, yet it holds a certain charm.</p>
<p>The simple design allows it to handle reminders and todo lists perfectly. It is a breeze to add straight forward notes or customise them with Labels, reminders and colour schemes should you feel the need.</p>
<p>It is surprisingly convenient to use, and in many ways punches well above it’s weight when compared to many todo apps. The app is also completely free which is a major bonus, considering the cost of most iOS todo apps seems to be £20+. You will need a Google account though, so nothing after that point is ever completely free.</p>
<p>By setting up labels for Writing, Home and Work; heavy use of tick boxes and reminders I have managed to set up a use case that is very similar to my Todoist setup. If you are in two minds if to stump up the cash for a year of a power todo app it might be worth checking out Google Keep first. It could very easily save you quite a bit of money per year.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Notes apps are a strange thing to review. Everyone already has one built into iOS, and the vast majority of people will never look anywhere else. I was one of those people until I was able to delete first party apps, and <a href="http://www.gr36.com/todoist-review/">much like replacing reminders with Todoist</a> – I’ve replaced Notes with Bear. Here’s my review.</p>
<p>By calling Bear a notes app it is much more approachable. When in reality it is a Markdown editor at heart. Allowing you to add in formatting while typing, for sharing later or simply for your own use. With a couple of key strokes you can add in links, headings, tick boxes, and even images. However if that is too much for your brain to remember there are shortcut buttons at the top of the keyboard.</p>
<p>Whether you are jotting down a quick note to yourself, or starting a long page of prose, nothing will disturb your writing. Images can be inserted and formatted to your liking, meaning that as you type you will be looking at exactly how the document looks. This wont make a blind bit of difference to simple notes, but perhaps it’s time to take even your personal notes to the next level!</p>
<h2><strong>Subscription Model</strong></h2>
<p>Like many pro apps available now, Bear adopts the freemium model. The app is free on all platforms, with a monthly or yearly subscription to unlock pro features. Your use case may or may not need these features but they include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sync</strong> all your notes between Bear for iPad, iPhone, and Mac. Powered by CloudKit. Learn more about Bear’s sync and autosave in Organise and publish.</li>
<li><strong>Export</strong> your notes to a variety of formats for publishing and sharing elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Beautiful Themes</strong> – eight at launch, and more to come, to give you just the right, comfortable environment for your creativity to flourish.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are unlocked via a single subscription that covers all your devices, paid directly through the App Store. If you want to try out the Pro features you can claim a free week by signing up for the subscription, so you won’t be charged for the first week of use. So if you try it and don’t like the app, cancel before that time and you wont be chanted a penny.</p>
<p>For the benefit of the review I will looking at the best version available, so I will be testing the Pro version. Bare this in mind during discussion of things like sharing if you don’t want to pay the £1.49 a month or £13.99 a year subscription. To me the subscription is well worth it for sync and the sharing options, but take this into account before jumping in.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="bear-review-premium-1-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/17549e07fa.jpg" alt="Bear review premium 1 1" width="599" height="353" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>The Good Looking Notes App</strong></h2>
<p>Rarely do you discus the design and UI of what appears to be such a simple. Yet Bear is one of the nicest to look at and simplest to use apps I have come across recently. Often the pretty facade quickly slips when you are searching for options or digging into menus to find things hidden for no good reason.</p>
<p>Bear has been expertly designed in both aesthetics and function. All of your notes are listed on the left hand menu, which can be accessed with a right swipe. Once you are editing or looking at a note the developers have made all of the formation options available in a shortcut bar above the keyboard. This sounds a simple thing to do, but lots of others hide these away behind a formatting menu.</p>
<p>Bear takes on exactly the same design in its companion Mac app, which is also available for free. The Mac app <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/faq/Shortcuts/Mac%20shortcuts/">supports loads of shortcut keys</a> but as yet doesn’t support any touch bar keys if you’ve updated to a 2016 MacBook Pro like I have. This is a shame, as other apps such as Ulysses has already pushed into this field, but it will only be a matter of time, so double check as they may have updated after publishing this review.</p>
<p>You only realise what is lacking form other apps when an app does it right, instantly clicking and fitting into your workflow. Remembering shortcut keys is sometimes confusing, and they are never universal! So making shortcuts easily available makes it much easier when first writing in the app. You can of cause use CMD+ shortcuts on the iPad with an attached keyboard to.</p>
<p>There are 8 different design options available in the app with more to come, including a dark mode for those that like using black. With that said design is more than just making things look pretty, as John Maeda says it is about meaningful results. The right balance of beauty and usability has been made here, the great design leads to a pleasing to use experience and an easy to understand menu and note organisation method.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="bear-review-screenshots-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0811410308.jpg" alt="Bear review screenshots 1" width="599" height="398" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>Tags</strong></h2>
<p>If you already use a powerful note taking app or service you will more than likely already use tags profusely. Tags, or any kind of organisation features are drastically lacking from the stock app which is annoying because these features are what make taking notes in an app so useful. By adding a simple # in any part of your text you can link similar notes together without fuss.</p>
<p>Bear will then list all these in the side of the menus, making them easy to edit and easy to find what you are looking for. Quickly falling into this practice as a writer is easy, with different publications linked and also tags for ideas and work in progress (WIP) articles.</p>
<p>The use of the hashtag is instantly recognisable to an Evernote user, <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/faq/?q=migrate">you can even migrate all of your current notes pretty easily</a>. The hashtag also makes tagging your notes instantly accessible to all, pretty much every smartphone users know how they work.</p>
<p>Users are also able to nest tags with ease, so organisational options really are limitless. By adding / to the tag you can organise until your hear is content. My article # now has article / ideas and a article / wip nested tags.</p>
<p>What your notes app contains is really up to you, and something that is as unique as the apps you use to get things done. Some users purely want a note pad and nothing else. If that is the case Bear will offer you a much better method of organising your notes. However the subscription may be expensive purely for this.</p>
<p>Whereas I use my notes to write out ideas for articles and later flesh them out into almost full posts. Because Bear offers me so much more in terms of exporting options I have instantly taken to it.</p>
<h2><strong>Sharing</strong></h2>
<p>Once agin the sharing options of this Notes app are right up there with a serious writing app. It offers the option for exporting the notes you have made in such a wide range of options it might take a while to work out which one you really need.</p>
<p>Powerful exporting options are missing from a number of similar app, with many simply offering rich text exporting and some apps offer none! Where as there isn’t many options you would need that Bear doesn’t support. With a simple swipe left while viewing a note you can share in Text, Markdown, PDF, HTML, Rich Text, DocX and if that wasn’t enough you can even export as an image. No more screenshots of your notes to publish in Instagram and Twitter.</p>
<p>This makes everything from writing stories to documents through to just jotting things down to remember a breeze. I have gotten into the habit of attaching PDF’s into Todoist tasks and also Fantastical appointments, simply because I can with relative ease.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="bear-review-landscape-1-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a95e5a17c2.jpg" alt="Bear review landscape 1 1" width="600" height="298" border="0" /></p>
<h1><strong>Deep Dive</strong></h1>
<p>My habits of late have changed to delve a little deeper into my app reviews. Finding all manor of ways to use apps to their full ability. If you need a hand with what all of these terms mean, I will be writing a guide shortly. Safe to say you will need to <a href="http://www.gr36.com/how-to-get-started-with-workflow/">invest in Workflow as a minimum</a> .</p>
<p>The developers of Bear are taking iOS automation seriously straight from the start. Implementing loads of URL call back options. The format of Bear URL Scheme action are as follows</p>
<pre><code>bear://x-callback-url/[action]?[action parameters]&amp;[x-callback parameters]
</code></pre>
<p>There are far too many things to go into and the extent you can customise quick launches and opening is huge. If you want to go through the full FAQ section and find all the <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/faq/X-callback-url%20Scheme%20documentation/">parameters head over to the Bear website</a> .</p>
<p>Two schemes i have used considerably is the simple /open-note parameter</p>
<pre><code>bear://x-callback-url/open-note
</code></pre>
<p>and also opening a specific tag – in my case my work in progress tag so I can see what needs some work on at any point.</p>
<pre><code>bear://x-callback-url/open-tag?name=article/wip
</code></pre>
<p>These can be customised as much or as little as you require, but it is great to see developers spending so much time building in the requirements of power users like myself.</p>
<h1><strong>Bear Verdict</strong></h1>
<p>When I start reviewing a new iOS app that replaces a first party option I often ask myself if anyone is likely to use it above the stock app. The reality is that _<br /><em><em>most</em></em> users are never going to look for something different. However that is not to say that no improvements can be made.</p>
<p>Bear is above and beyond a notes app, almost to the level that labelling it one is so far off the mark it is stupid. Bear is more along the lines of a writing app, it does more than many available Markdown editors. Being able to export and share things with ease, it would replace my old writing app of choice ByWord very easily.</p>
<p>I have slotted Bear in between my current writing app of choice, Ulysses, and my brain. It gives me the ability to format and position text in a small light weight app before moving them to Ulysses for images and publishing. If you simply want a notes app that syncs to all your devices, then look no further than the stock app. If you are looking for something with as many power features as you can cram into an truly gorgeous looking app, then the small subscription is a no brainer.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>For as long as I can remember I’ve had a weird draw to organising things. It started with stationary and folders, and in the digital age expanded into spreadsheets and lists. I consider myself an organised person – yet one app has improved this further, <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not even going to pretend this app isn’t expensive. If you are not a big user of todo lists or you’re not looking for something to improve your productivity then this may not be the app for you.</p>
<p>There is a free trial available though, download the app and sign up, then wait for the offer by email. It usually pops into your inbox after a day or so or <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">sign up here for a free account</a>. This will give you a month of premium services, so you can sink your teeth into the app and decide if if outlay is worth it for your use case. With that said I haven’t been using Todoist very long, but have already signed up after a few days of getting my set up sorted!</p>
<p>If you are serious about productivity then the £21.99 per year subscription model won’t be an issue for you. It is a shame you can’t spread the cost monthly like other services, but is works out less than £2 a month really. Premium services include some pretty great features so you won’t be disappointed. For the purpose of the review I will be covering Premium features and these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task Labels &amp; Reminders</li>
<li>Location-based notifications</li>
<li>Add tasks via email</li>
<li>Attach files and comments to tasks</li>
<li>Automatic backups</li>
<li>Productivity tracking and charts</li>
<li>iCal synchronization</li>
<li>Project templates</li>
</ul>
<p>Todoist is completely cross platform with 13 different apps available for various platforms, including a web sign in for everything else. This is a feature lacking from quite a few competing apps, allowing for a log in from any device. You can also collaborate on tasks should work colleagues or friends also use the app, they stand a good chance as Todoist currently has 3 million users.</p>
<h2><strong>Sort Your Tasks</strong></h2>
<p>For many years I have been using iCloud Reminders and Notes perfectly well. This is an excepts app and pretty good solution for most users, but Todoist turbo charges organisation and productivity. More than this it makes everything easy to understand. Breaking all your tasks down into Projects and allowing you to set labels and organise with filters.</p>
<p>Not only is the layout of the app easy to understand, Todoist makes adding tasks a breese. The apps allows for entry of whatever it is you need to get done in natural language in a similar vain as one of my other favourite apps Fantastical. Setting up a task is as easy as inputting the description followed by when you want to do it e.g. “Publish new story tomorrow at 9am”. You can also attach this task to a Project by adding #project name and a Label by adding @label.<br /><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-10-24-Todoist-review-iphones-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c794feac6e.jpg" alt="2017 10 24 Todoist review iphones 1" width="599" height="398" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>Projects</strong></h2>
<p>When opening the app the first things you will come across are Projects. Think of Project as an area in which the task falls into, these really should be called ‘groups’ or some <a href="https://medium.com/by-vernon/this-is-how-i-set-up-todoist-and-actually-gtd-3867e5e887a8#.eg67ygm5b">people refer to these as ‘Buckets’.</a> These took me the longest time to get my head around, the name more than anything threw me off. Splitting tasks isn’t a unique thing for an app to do, however identifiers such as ‘home’, ‘work’ and ‘writing’ makes understanding them easier.</p>
<p>Although you can set up projects however you wish. This could be used on an ad hoc basis for specific projects for project management, or used as I do just for a specific area. The amount of different options really are limitless, you can create sub-projects under main projects to ensure everything is organised and also implement colour coding to make everything easy to see.</p>
<p>Inside the projects you place those pesky tasks that need to be completed. Giving them a description and customising them as much or as little as you like. You can structure sub tasks underneath them, you can leave comments on the task and even attach a range of files with ease. This is amazingly pretty unique for a task manager – most seem to support only pictures or voice recording. Whereas Todoist will allow images, text files, pdfs and many more.</p>
<p>Tasks can also be given a priority, or Flag, dependant on how important they are. This will dictate where they appear in your lists. You can also set this by dragging and dropping tasks into the order you want them, or simply adding some Labels.</p>
<h2><strong>Labels And Filters</strong></h2>
<p>I made the mistake of rushing into Labels and thinking they would work the same as my Ulysses tag Workflow. However I found a bit of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-ways-i-use-todoist-getting-things-done-gtd-brad-bush">inspiration from the internet</a> and created different Labels dependent on time they would take. If I had a spare hour I could just look at that specific tag, meaning tasking could be squeezed into any spare time I had. Productivity x10!</p>
<p>That really helps when you combine Projects and Labels into easy to view Filters. Filters allow you to easily see any task that fits into set criteria. You can set them for anything you wish by using Todoist advanced query system, combining them to make sure you only see what you need.</p>
<p>For example I have set up filters for Writing tasks that are Labeled 10mins, so I can see anything that just needs a proof read. Or another for any tasks that really need to be done today – of cause coloured red and named URGENT!</p>
<p>I have many overlapping filters that can pull anything that needs doing with a specific requirement. What’s more is that if my needs change, the app designers have made it so simple to create or edit filters it takes a few moments. Filters are really what has made tasks easy to see and finish when spare time occurs, rather than picking through iCloud reminders to see if I. Office anything I could do.</p>
<h2><strong>More than you think</strong></h2>
<p>Todoist also fills all the basic requirements, such as the ability to set reminders for tasks that need to be done at a certain date/time. Reminders can also be set for when you reach a certain location, so it’s easy to assign things that need to be done when out and about. Reminders could be set for simple things such as shopping requirements or just tasks you need to do as soon as you get home.</p>
<p>If you miss a date or time, Todoist will even reschedule the task quickly and easily. Either automatically with a suggested best time to fit the task into your day. Or you can set it to another specific date/time with a couple of taps. Don’t worry about those recurring issues either as you can set the same task to come back or a regular basis. So the gym reminder won’t go away that easily if you don’t want it to!</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that the app will sync all your Tasks, Project, Labels etc to all of the device you have. It does this quickly and solidly, with no fall out. I use Todoist on iPhone, iPad and two different Macs with flawless results. I keep bashing iCloud reminders, and in the most part I have had very little issues, but when they did occur tasks wouldn’t sync to other devices or they would just disappear completely.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-10-24-Todoist-review-tick-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/26a9107f7b.jpg" alt="2017 10 24 Todoist review tick 1" width="599" height="388" border="0" />The app also awards you ‘Karma’ for completed tasks. This has been heralded by some as a great incentive to create and complete tasks on time but hasn’t served any purpose for me. However if you like competing with yourself then you might find some motivation from it. For every completed task you are awarded some points, these combine to boost you up the five different levels.</p>
<p>Right now I am sat at 1160 with a Novice label, however I have only been using the app a short while. The karma screen can be found at the top next your name, and does give you some good info about over due and completed tasks. If its annoying you can turn Karma off completely and the space will indicate how many task you have completed instead.</p>
<h2><strong>Deep Dive</strong></h2>
<p>With all of this said, they real beauty I have found in the app is its support for URL call back and <a href="https://ifttt.com/todoist">IFTTT integration</a>. If you’re reading this section I’m pretty sure you already know what these can do for you, however it is nice to see such large development in the area.</p>
<p>Macstories uncovered that Todoist <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/why-i-left-icloud-reminders-for-todoist/">supports several undocumented URL scheme to help automate opening specific areas of the app</a>. To quickly see a weekly over view set up Launch Centre Pro or Workflow to open: <code>todoist://next7days</code></p>
<p>To search for a task<br /><code>todoist://search?query=prompt</code></p>
<p>Or quickly add a task<br /><code>todoist://addtask?content=prompt&amp;date=prompt</code></p>
<p>This is also far from the limit, there is inbuilt support in AirMail to send emails straight to Todoist, which come in handy for tasks that you need to refer back to an email. The app also supports integration into Google calendar and iCloud calendar, so your tasks with a date can been seen in your appointments.</p>
<h2><strong>Todoist Verdict</strong></h2>
<p>With all the features outlined above the options for your set up really are limitless. All of them combine to make Todoist such a delight to use as an everyday tool. The interface is easy to understand and uncomplicated, which is the downfall of similar apps. With not too much work you can designate an area and a time frame to make sure you can cram all your tasks into any amount of time.</p>
<p>The price may be a downfall for some, and it really is a shame they do not offer a monthly subscription option. However with the constant improvements and the ability the app has, if you have the cash consider the investment well worth it.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>I held out as long as I could, but I have now caved and bought a Series 2 Apple Watch. Not because it is anything revolutionary, not because I accidentally killed my original version (although I kinda did) but because health and fitness has become so important to me I feel the investment is worth it. I have also found a perfect complication to match my new Nike + version – Healthface.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Apple still have not allowed third party watch faces, yet made a small compromise with adding in custom complications with watchOS 2.0. Some apps have embraced the concept and updated their apps to add in everything from weather to quick links into their apps.</p>
<p>Yet very few apps have really invested in the idea of complications, and developed anything new. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/uk/app/healthface/id1176374647">Healthface by Crunchy Bagel</a> is an excellent and uncomplicated iOS app that displays health data on any accompanying Apple Watch.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="healthface-review-featured-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/38699d91b9.jpg" alt="Healthface review featured 1" width="500" height="293" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong><strong>Complications</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The best part about the whole experience is the ease at which you can display a whole range of metrics right on your Apple Watch. Customise the amount of info displayed and place it on your watch face of choice in both a small or a large complication. Anything that is recorded in the health app can be displayed by Healthface on absolutely any watch face.</p>
<p>I’ve stuck to the boring step count or mindful minutes depending on the watch face I am using at the time. Although you can set anything from vitals, to body measurements or even reproductive health depending on your requirements.</p>
<p>All of the set up is done through the iOS app, by default displaying all of the available watch faces you can choose from. Tapping on a watch face displays the type of complications available. These vary lots dependant on the face, the Mickey Mouse face for example has a Utilitarian small and Utilitarian large available. Where as my weekend watch face, Numerals, only has the Utilitarian small available.</p>
<p>You can then adjust which information you wish to be displayed and also customise how you wish it to be displayed. You can customise the unit of measurement and also any icons displayed in the complication. With a live preview of how the complication will appear at the top of the screen, as seen on the furthest right screen shot above.</p>
<p>Once the design is perfected, then you can place the complication on your watch face using a long press (force touch) and selecting ‘customise’. However because of how watchOS works, this complication will be the same across all watch faces that use that particular complication size. Meaning that unfortunately you cannot have different info displayed on different watch faces if they use the same complication size.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="healthface-review-screenshots-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7c1a56554f.jpg" alt="Healthface review screenshots 1" width="600" height="265" border="0" /><br />Tapping on the complication will open up a screen where the information can be refreshed. You will only need to do this when placing the complication or changing the data displayed. I have found myself pressing the complication by accident a few times, it is a shame this cant be locked somehow. Although this is all by design from Apple, so these types of changes are outside of the developer control.</p>
<p>The real benefit of Healthface is putting your complications to work for you. Saving time digging into the Health app on your phone when you simply want to see a select piece of data you are keeping an eye on. Want to see your steps quickly and easily, no problem. Prefer to see your average heart rate – easy. The options are limitless and it’s great to see a developer using complications to make life easier.</p>
<p>Healthface is available <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/uk/app/healthface/id1176374647">for £0.79 from the app store</a>, if you’re serious about health it should be a must.</p>

<p>For all of the time Lucie has been with us I have become accustomed to being awake at ridiculous times of the morning. Autism has provided some truly magical things in our life, but some truly difficult things too. Broken sleep is one of the hardest thing to cope with and makes everything that bit harder. Yet this morning it’s not Lucie fault, I’m awake because I’m actually sleeping better!</p>
<p>So its 4am, I’m wide awake and feeling great after quite a few hours deep sleep. The weirdest thing is I am remembering my dreams instead of being in a strange state of not quite sleeping but not being awake like usual.</p>
<p>The difference hasn’t been anything revolutionary, so much so I couldn’t tell you what the difference really is. I am trying to spend more time meditating and being mindful as much as I can – those that know me know I’m really bad at being buddhist!</p>
<p>Every once in a while I just need a push to think about myself more, because I am always worrying about everyone else and neglecting myself. I think thats natural for everyone, but sometimes in life it’s good to be selfish at least for a few days. If I take more time to think about myself I am going to be better equipped to look after everyone else.</p>
<h2>Being Mindfull</h2>
<p>To me being mindful is not about changing the way you are, but changing the way you think about things. Recognising that your emotions are there and realising why they change and doing things to put yourself in a better state. Things are always sent to try us, life would be pretty boring without them, but it is how you feel and the way you deal with things that makes the difference.</p>
<p>This is all very well when you have had a good nights sleep and feel fresh – so lets hope it continues when Lucie decides its time to wake up!</p>

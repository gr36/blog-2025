  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When August rolls around it is my time of the year to switch to Android for a little while. It started as a stop gap to sell my iPhone and Apple Watch while the prices are still high and wait for the event, but now it is something I look forward to. For the last 2 years I have switched to a Galaxy Note, because like Matt Birchler, I like to keep my toe dipped into the water and see what Android is up to. This year more than others I am really starting to debate going back because the IPhone is poorly designed in comparison.</p>
<p>The Note 9 opened my eyes to what a big screened phone could be like to use when the company really cares about how you use it. Samsung slimmed the bezels and narrowed the screen to 18.5:9 making the whole handset feel a while lot smaller than it should. Even with a screen larger than any other iPhone it felt ergonomic and much more comfortable to use, something that further improved with the Note10.</p>
<p>This really starts to sting when you pick up an iPhone XS Max, a device that is smaller in physical size, but feels much larger due to how poorly designed it is. The team behind current generation iPhone design must place the way it feels in your hand bottom of the pile of concerns. The 5.5” screened device is admittedly light years ahead of the old ‘plus’ devices, but is simply a stretched iPhone XS. The XS Max is not only huge, but astonishingly heavy and cumbersome to hold.</p>
<p>In contrast when first holding the Note10+ I had to double check the model number twice, simply because it feels much smaller than it is. Sure the ‘infinity display’ helps, but its clear to see (and feel) that the team behind the design took time to think about how it felt in the hand. It’s glass front and back (and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/why-samsung-galaxy-note-10-needs-a-case" rel="noopener noreferrer">ridiculously slippy</a>), it’s packed full of battery and similar technology to the iPhone XS Max, so why does it feel so much nicer?</p>
<p>Perhaps because Samsung have been producing large screened phones the longest they have simply learnt from their mistakes. Yet I am always taken back to Apple adverts that point out how far your thumb can stretch, something they have put no thought into with modern devices. As another year brings another iPhone we look set to see the same design used again, same wider screen, same glass and metal and same feel in your hand.</p>
<p>This year I feel stuck more than ever (I know I said this <a href="https://gr36.com/finding-apple-escape-velocity/" rel="noopener noreferrer">last year too</a>), I’m starting to wish that it was easier for me to use Android long term, not only because the devices are more interesting but because there is more choice of devices. My choice of handset is based on being entrenched in an ecosystem and stuck with the lack of iPhone progress. There is an arrogance around Apple design now and I’m pretty sure Apple know you’re stuck so don’t even try.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’m new to drones, but decided to try one out to get some more interesting video and I’m glad I did. However because it is so new to me I didn’t really want to spend loads of cash on one if I wasn’t going to use it, so I decided to pick up a used<a href="https://www.dji.com/uk/spark"> DJI Spark</a> and DJI Spark controller one.</p>
<p>I managed to get a fly more kit with a few extras for a bargain price, but when it turned up I had issues connecting and paring. There wasn’t a whole load of information out there other than forum posts, but I managed to piece everything together and get it working again. Hopefully the guide will help you as well.</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-grey">
<div class="kg-callout-emoji">💡</div>
<div class="kg-callout-text">Before you do this, its a good idea to plug the spark into DJI Assistant and check the firmware version and / or factory reset it.</div>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Hold down the power button on the DJI Spark for 9 seconds until you hear three beeps. Then do the same on the controller.</li>
<li>Power off both the DJI Spark and the DJI Spark controller.</li>
<li>Power on the DJI Spark controller and then hold down the pause, Fn and bottom right shoulder button (underneath the camera button) until you hear continuous beeping.</li>
<li>Power on the DJI Spark, then press and hold the power button until you hear one beep. Make sure your DJI Spark controller isn’t too far away from the DJI Spark. You will see the DJI Spark controller connect to the Spark and its lights turn green.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dont forget you need to WiFi connect to the controller (password is 12341234 for all remotes) and then open the DJI app. Hopefully you’ll be up and flying in no time.</p>

<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="powerbeats-pro-featured.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/53b47a4042.jpg" alt="Powerbeats pro featured" width="599" height="337" border="0" /></p>
<p>My biggest problem with headphones is that I have too many of them. Gone are the days of having one pair to last you years on end, If you can avoid the removal of your headphone jack you might last a while, but the reliance on Bluetooth brings better models ever to the market. Now owned by Apple, Beats are the masters of this, producing a never-ending stream of better models of each version of their headphones. The Powerbeats have seen little improvement other than the introduction on the W1 chip since launching in 2013. Six years later sees the most significant update to the line ever, incorporating a new Apple chip and making them truly wireless.</p>
<p>The Powerbeats Pro builds on the technology, and hopefully, the success of Apple own AirPods. Incorporating the security, convenience and power saving of the new H1 chip (signifier changed from W to H). Something that no other manufacturer has access to, nor has been able to complete with fully as yet.</p>
<p>The claim from Beats is that the Powerbeats are the most popular fitness headphone in the world. A bold claim, and arguably hard to prove – take a look next time you’re at the gym or out for a run, and you don’t see many of them. However, I am a massive fan, owning all versions to date.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="powerbeats-pro-phone-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6994ba177b.jpg" alt="Powerbeats pro phone 1" width="1000" height="500" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>Usability</strong></h2>
<p>Upon unboxing the Powerbeats Pro, the surprisingly high build quality is evident. Often criticised for their use of plastic Beats haven’t changed their ways much, but the surface feels premium and worth the price tag. These are of course more than £200, and for that money you get almost double the battery, all be it in a comically large carry case.</p>
<p>Simply opening the case allows for quick paring to iOS and macOS devices, and once completed, the connection will sync to all your iCloud devices. Of course, you’ve heard all this before; we saw this on both generations of AirPods and older Beats headphones.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="powerbeats-pro-case-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f125da3d8e.jpg" alt="Powerbeats pro case 1" width="1000" height="800" border="0" /></p>
<p>Where Powerbeats Pro stand out is usability that suits the fitnesses market perfectly. They seal well in the ear, and the ear hooks mean that you won’t have any issues with them moving around during even the most rigorous of exercise. If you’ve ever tried to run with wired headphones, you will know how freeing it is to have nothing flapping around or pulling on your ears. This new wave of genuinely wireless headphone is revolutionary to those that have spent many years having to run a cable down your top. Once you use these, you won’t be going back any time soon, and this alone is worth the price tag.</p>
<p>Sweat resistance is stated by Beats but only for the earbuds themselves. So don’t get caught in any downpours or spill anything on the case – this <em><em>is</em></em>surprising given how robustly they are made. Everything is all sealed off from the elements leaving just charging pins and buttons exposed. You read that right, not a touch interface or reliance on voice commands insight. Tactile buttons the same on each ear to change the volume and play/pause. You can also hold the centre <em><em>B</em></em> button down to activate Siri if you wish – but don’t forget with the W1 brings with it Hey Siri support.</p>
<p>She will hear you loud and clear for all your voice commands, but obviously, you’ll need a data connection to do this. I’ve been running phone free with a connection to my Apple Watch and even letting Siri read my incoming messages out for me. The microphone is surprisingly clear for the few calls I have taken on them while working out, but no reassurance that I was running was needed. It’s obvious you are on hands-free, but not distracting to the person you’re talking to, they are leaps and bounds ahead of the already pretty good Powerbeats3.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="powerbeats-pro-buds-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/38a5fd5edb.jpg" alt="Powerbeats pro buds 1" width="600" height="300" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>Sound</strong></h2>
<p>I want to say that these are the only headphones you will ever need, but if your ear is tuned to listen to the very best cans, you are going to have to compromise. They are never going to win any awards for sound quality given that most of the time in use you are moving around somewhat energetically. The sound is much improved over previous versions, with a tremendous dynamic range with a slight emphasis on bass.</p>
<p>They are a delight to listen to music and spoken word such as podcasts. Some downplay the sound of all Beats headphones, but the Powerbeats more than any other, I would argue they don’t need to sound perfect. However, the Powerbeats sound better than acceptable, much better than the previous version.</p>
<p>What I particularly like is that some sound from outside gets through despite the useful sealing tips. I’m not a fan of completely isolating headphones when exercising, being able to hear traffic and people around you is a must. The Powerbeats Pro also pause your music when you take one out your ear, which comes in especially useful when telling someone to re-rack their weights.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>This all detracts from the fact that these could, and should, be considered more than just workout headphones. They deserve much more than to be thrown into your gym bag or only used occasionally, they are real AirPod competitors. Both the sound and fit are much better than Apples own version, but they give up a little ground on the overall design.</p>
<p>I couldn’t ever see myself replacing my Airpods with these, but I won’t be wearing anything else for activities. I can’t state enough how much of a revelation running with no wires is. I have ears that won’t keep Airpods or indeed any other earbuds in, so Powerbeats are almost my only option. It’s rare I would recommend an upgrade on headphones even if you have the last version – but for everyone on the fence – you need these in your life.</p>
<p>The Beats PowerBeats Pro come in black, white, navy or green, costing <a href="https://amzn.to/31MMMLa">£219.95</a>.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>The post will also forever be known as I’ve never given Apple notes enough of a chance and I bet you haven’t either. Despite two significant updates in recent years I’ve skirted around Apple notes usage, both for hand-written pencil ones and also writing things down, yet never used it entirely. There isn’t any good reason for this; many people use the stock notes app to the best of its abilities, it’s just never really ‘clicked’ – until now.</p>
<p>Notes are the cornerstone of my life, more so as I get older, I have to write stuff down rather than rely on my memory. I need to take meeting notes, I need to share information for my podcast, and I need to make shopping lists, so I don’t go hungry. When I add into this mix the fact I like to write a Journal and also write my blog posts, I end up with things spread all over the place.</p>
<p>If I can’t remember to buy food, I sure as hell won’t remember if I put my blog post idea in Ai Writer, Drafts or whatever cool app I’m using at this moment in time. You see I’ve skirted around all sorts of apps to do this with varying degrees of success (the closest was <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/bear/">Bear</a>), but nothing stuck. So I decided on all my requirements, and the Stock Apple Notes app was the most intimate. Using Apple Notes To Write In 2019.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Notes app, the stock iOS app isn’t ugly, but it won’t win any design awards. What it offers is rock-solid sync between devices (my two iMacs, iPad and iPhone) and a service I can trust to collect everything together with minimal fuss. Every time I think about my time with Evernote, I shudder a little, but Apple Notes offers what the vast majority of people need. I consider myself a power user, so some adaptations were required, and miser up becomes infantry more powerful when you take into account integration with Shortcuts and Siri. I didn’t want to go crazy as <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/ipad-diaries-optimizing-apple-notes/">some users have</a>, but if I am putting my life into one app, it needs to be useful.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Set-Up</strong></strong></h2>
<p>I like clear divides between my work and personal life, so the first step was creating areas for both of these things. Apple Notes makes it dead simple to have folders of notes and not allows them to be nested. Once I am in a folder, created notes go straight into that folder, and sync to all my devices within a minute or so. Meaning my created folders become sudo workspaces, a handy feature of more specific writing apps such as Drafts.</p>
<p>If I’m in work mode, I will only see work-related notes. This also become more helpful with iOS13 ability to open multiple notes in split-screen and move between them with ease.</p>
<p>Using Emoji in the folder names also makes these much easier to find, as does not having too many of them. You can make this as in-depth as you like, notes does allow sub-folders to be set up on iOS now and once done, they will sync across all devices – and show up in iCloud.com. Keeping everything organised does help with finding the information you’re looking for, but spotlight is often your friend.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Shortcuts &amp; Siri</strong></strong></h2>
<p>Recent updates to Shortcuts makes working with Apple Notes much more natural and dare I say it enjoyable to use. Shortcuts has the ability to search, list, append and show specific notes with a few taps. Or indeed voice commands, the joy of using a stock app is the access it has to features very few other apps do. Siri is a breeze to use with Apple Notes for capturing content and working with Shortcuts.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>All In?</strong></strong></h2>
<p>What I enjoy about using Apple Notes is the mature and familiar feel. It is simple and straight forward to understand and to use a tired old saying – it just works. Other apps out there feature fantastic publication features, tagging and all sorts of things – but I’m always stuck with a sync issue at some point, or a feature stops working for a little while. I have none of those fears with this setup.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are issues some times, but for the most part, Apple service is now trustworthy. With notes powerful features, integration with the OS and brand new dark mode, it’s hard to go anywhere else.</p>
<p>My only issue is publishing from the app, other apps have much better sharing features, so writing has another step in it. I’m hoping to build some more powerful Shortcut once iSO13 comes out and solve this issue. At the moment in time, I am only using Apple notes, and very happy that I have found my almost perfect setup.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Ever noticed on Apple Maps that more and more reviews are appearing for places you want to visit? Since <a href="https://searchengineland.com/apple-maps-adds-new-review-sources-replacing-yelp-outside-us-in-many-cases-218020">2015</a> Apple has been pushing to make their stock mapping app much more useful for its users. Granted, it couldn’t have got much worse, but Apple realises the power in making your device more useful and engaging for their users.</p>
<p>Now comes the time they must open up and Maps, allow customers to make alterations much easier — and most importantly create reviews inside Apple Maps.</p>
<h2>For</h2>
<p>There are numerous social media posts and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/cjt733/can_we_talk_about_how_bad_the_yelp_integration_is/">Reddit threads</a> saying similar things. Reviews and photos of points on a map, doesn’t have to be a business, are one of the most helpful things available — after navigation, of course. It helps people find what they need and get a good idea of the experience if they visit.</p>
<p>Many a time I’ve searched on Google Maps for a park in the local area to take the kids and scrolled through the pictures to see what is there. This is times one hundred when looking for somewhere to eat, drink, or anything really, users need to know what this place is actually like. Downloading another app to do this just isn’t going to cut it.</p>
<p>There is also a massive disparity between review based on your country. The US still relies heavily on Yelp, while the UK leans on Trip Advisor, so it’s more challenging knowing where the data is coming from and how reliable it is. Apple must control this from start to finish (as they so love to do) and aid its users more by allowing all its customer base to review every point of interest in Apple Maps quickly. Offering a simple incentive to begin with when users upload pictures and reviews, similar to Google Local Guides, give Apple a tremendous kick-start and opens map reviews up to over a billion users.</p>
<p>Pulling this in from other places is one thing, but if you’ve ever known the pain of waiting for ordinance survey or any traditional service to even mark a new street on the maps is a horrible experience. All of a sudden you have a billion people updating and making the whole world for you.</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5136" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9fb7a8ade0.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="921" />Against</h2>
<p>This is yet another thing for Apple to delve into and manage. With increasing criticism surrounding their foray into services and subscriptions, Apple is doomed if they do and damned if they don’t. Their insistence on controlling every aspect of their hardware and software from start to finish means that they often neglect users needs and also software stability.</p>
<p>Regardless of being managed by different teams, if attention is taken away from more critical areas, then a move into map reviews seems pointless. Google already found out the hardware that maintaining user-generated map changes and improvements can become untenable, and arguably the only reason them support maps is to sell adverts to companies. A business model that no longer interests Apple.</p>
<p>Pulling in data from <a href="https://searchengineland.com/apple-maps-adds-new-review-sources-replacing-yelp-outside-us-in-many-cases-218020">Trip Advisor</a> and services like <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/54.910/-3.432">OpenStreetMap</a> is the easiest way to gain masses of data with minimal investment or development. Policing reviews is a complicated process, one that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scammers-edit-google-maps-bank-listings-fraud-2018-11">Google has pulled back from</a>, so opening maps data up is not without its downsides. Do the server-side costs, review work and the general hassle make it worthwhile?</p>

      <p>Look, we need to talk. This is something that many of you are not going to like, it’s going to ruin your fancy home screen set up but it might actually save you money. You’re expecting too much from a new task manager, it won’t make you more productive.</p><p>Organisation and productivity comes from within, it’s not a superpower, but it’s not something lines of code can solve. Much like an exercise app won’t make you lose weight, a fancy task manager might be more helpful, it might make things easier for you to find but if you’re not using a stock app to its full potential you really don’t need to buy anything else.</p><blockquote>We are told this product or that gadget will solve our problems. That our next purchase will be the solution we’ve been looking for all along. — Joshua Becker</blockquote><p>The reason you want to keep switching, or buying a new version is understandable and is the result of a much larger issue. Much like Joshua Becker touches on above consumers expect far too much from their purchases. A task manager is a powerful tool to have, it helps tremendously to remember your tasks and also plan to get more done, but don’t expect it to transform your life and productivity.</p><p>Working on yourself and your internal drive is a much better area to place your energy into, not moving all your tasks into another app for the 4th time this month. Stop expecting quick fixes, if it was as easy as switching apps everyone would be productivity powerhouses. I know it’s the in thing to spend your time watching YouTube videos and worrying about the perfect set up, it doesn’t exist and you’re just stressing yourself out and wasting more time that could be better spent.</p>

<p>Like most people in the UK I spent Saturday at the beach, in fact, we went for the whole weekend. We had great fun, spending all day in the sand and the sea, and it improved my mental health. There is something very uplifting and calming about feeling the sand and smelling the sea air.</p>
<p>What was surprising was the number of people I observed spending more time taking photos than they did enjoying the situation. This isn’t a millennial thing either; it was a whole range of people from teenagers right the way through to those in their twilight years. All were posing in weird positions or waiting for certain things to happen to take photos and share them.</p>
<p>I don’t think these were for mementoes, the occasional selfie might have been, but most of those shots gave the impression they weren’t for themselves at all – they were for everyone else. Instead of enjoying the experience, a large percentage of people were looking at it through the lens of their camera, and when not doing that they were thinking about what pictures to take. On several occasions, the telltale “wait let me take a picture” can be heard while every little detail is caught on film.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This isn’t about taking photos, I take loads of them, in fact one of my favourite things to do is just wander around a park with my camera and look for photos to take. It’s about experiencing things fully and not taking yourself out of the moment. Record little clips of sporting events and concerts, but don’t watch the whole things through your camera screen. How on earth Glastonbury attendees managed to rack up <a href="https://newsroom.ee.co.uk/glastonbury-festival-2019-breaks-data-records/">100GB</a> of traffic is completely beyond me.</p>
<p>Memories live in your head, and last a whole long longer than your cloud storage solution to your bulging photo album.</p>

<p>I remember our first born like it was yesterday, it didn’t go smoothly though the pregnancy, she arrived a few days late, and we spent around a week in the hospital afterwards. But as soon as Lucie came into the world, all the stress of the preceding few weeks made it all worthwhile. She looked at me with her big brown eyes, and I wept as my world changed forever.</p>
<p>The next nine years have been even much harder in places. Years filled with hospital appointments, sleepless nights and bouts of deep depression for us both. However, all the pain we felt, all the stress we have had (and still to come), and all the deamons we have fought off have all been worth it.</p>
<p>I can’t imagine my life without a struggle in it. People often ask me how we cope with having a child with a complex disability – and I always answer precisely the same – we know no different. Despite us having another child who is ‘normal’ (although that’s a stretch some times), we have never known a life not filled with the tasks we now consider normal. Our life is dictated by our calendar, our meetings and fights for funding, but it’s filled with the most amount of love I have ever felt.</p>
<p>When I opened the door this morning with a little girl in toe she had no idea it was her birthday, yet she jumped up and down and shook with such excitement when she saw her presents and balloons it made it all worthwhile (even though it took me 2 hours to built a tent for her!). My life stresses me out, it makes me sad at points, and it exhausts me mentally and physically – but I love it. I love battling for my daughter to live as normal life as possible, and although I would give anything for her to be able to do more things, I wouldn’t change her for the world.</p>
<p>Thank you Lucie for teaching me more in your nine years with us than all the others combined. Thank you for making me a better person and giving me the best cuddles in the world.</p>
<p>I love you sweetie x.</p>

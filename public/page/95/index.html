      <p>While redesigning my blog, and then doing it again, I thought long and hard about comments left on posts. I don’t get very many, all of which are from web mentions, but I like receiving them and wanted to consider them in the design. Giving them space was easy to do, but the most significant consideration is where to place the barriers to entry and its a harder decision than I thought.</p><p>When browsing jobs a few years ago, I was surprised how many didn’t have an online application processes, and many still required a handwritten application form. Naively I put this down to old companies not moving with the times; now I am convinced most of this is intentional.</p><p>Of course, you want the process to be as pain-free as possible, but making the application process too easy could potentially be even worse. Applying for the position all of sudden doesn’t need much thought, and applications submitted on a whim and leading to a much longer consideration process and an overall waste of time for all involved.</p><p>The same can be said for comments, make them too easy, like Youtube, and you can suffer from a deluge of half thought out impulse comment that means very little. Make the process too complicated and time-consuming, and you run the risk of putting everyone off. You’ll only receive the very extremes of comments, from the very highly motivated individual – be they good or bad.</p><p>So where do the barriers lie to produce the right amount of resistance, and receive the right amount of results? Perhaps I am overthinking things considering the low level of comments I have anyway. I started thinking about WordPress comments, but it opened ups whole new world of appreciation for intentional barriers to entry. – and I am yet to reach a decision.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For the last few months, I’ve had an itch at the back of my brain. Something I just couldn’t put my finger on and no amount of de-stressing or meditation seemed to fix it. The feeling was a strange one, one that I couldn’t place, and it was making me not feel myself. It wasn’t caused by any upset, nor by any illness or fatigue – it was because I had too much stuff.</p>
<p>The bits and pieces, the nick lacks and junk you pick up without going through life was starting to build up again, and it was making me feel stressed without even knowing it.</p>
<p>Minimalism hit me like a train at the end of 2016 after seeing the <a href="https://minimalismfilm.com/">Minimalism documentary</a> made by Matt D’Avella. I’d been spending far too much on things that didn’t make me happy, and were just to paper over other issues. It instantly spoke to me, and I began to slim down almost everything I owned. My wardrobe, my possessions and more importantly, my technology were all scrutinised. Slimming down made me much happier, my bank healthier and my outlook on life completely different.</p>
<p>I would say, a couple of weeks after, I was a completely different person. Enjoying different things, and engaging in different ways with my family, friends and the world online.</p>
<p>This year, the stuff has been creeping back slowly. Temptations to buy this and that have been fought off, but I haven’t been as ruthless with keeping accumulated items at bay. Bags have been hanging around full of freebies from events, not throwing away or donating items I no longer need. And worst of all, the stress of presents piling up for family members taking over my office space.</p>
<p>So this past week has been spent slimming down again (and fight off illness). I’m so glad I spotted this when I did, because its important to me to focus on essential things, and not let the unimportant rule my life. If you haven’t tried it already, give it a go, and I promise it will change you too.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I remember when watching the news each day was considered almost mandatory. To keep yourself up to speed and informed on essential events was considered the done thing. When did the reporting become so dirty and shameless? I don’t want to get into that here, but I do want to get into the App News app. It seems to be getting worse, and each time I try and use it, I have to battle through topics I have no interest in, to find a few bits I do.</p><p>I have been unable to clear away persistent Election updates since that whole farce started. Apple added it into my following section without asking, and there is no way to remove it. Apple has been shoving politics at me if I like it or not. I want to use the Apple News app because I can’t find an alternative, and since adding in magazines, it shows how horrible an app it is. Heres the thing, I think rolling magazines into Apple News was a huge mistake. The content doesn’t go together, and the two sides the app are drastically different.</p><h2 id="split-it-out">Split It Out</h2><p>The magazine tab features well-written and researched articles that look great. You only have to look at something like Men’s Health to see what digesting exciting publications can achieve. Content that flows well together, images fitting of the design and overall an impressive, immersive list of publications that matter.</p><p>Whereas the News tab is the polar opposite. News topics are forced into your face if you like them or not, with a massive influx of clickbait and dramatic headlines. They don’t seem to be selected by algorithm because I’ve never clicked on one, but Top Stories is constantly a cesspool. You’re never quite sure if the full story is going to be featured, or if you are going to have to head to the website anyway. There also doesn’t seem to be any monitoring of the content submitted, and overall I detest ever visiting the tab.</p><p>I have tried so many times to try and ‘fix’ the algorithm, spent weeks telling Apple I don’t want this type of story, but nothing makes a blind bit of difference. I have never come across anyone that’s subscribed to News +, but I certainly would if I didn’t have depressing, uninteresting News shoved in my face all the time.</p>

<p>It used to be the place I wanted to hang out. It looked like a utopia and promised so much – but unfortunately, it isn’t, and it has offered me very little. So, my micro.blog account is no more.</p>
<p>This is the second time I have deleted everything; the first time was to start again and work out a way to host my blog on the platform. However, as time has moved on, the blogging on micro.blog has dissolved into more ‘status updates’ and long threads (which are not threaded at all) or talking.</p>
<p>I wasn’t looking for another Twitter; I was looking for short microblogs and others that loved the things I did. The blog posts are still there and written by some fascinating people, but they are hidden under mountains of photos, and videos, and podcasts, and it is impossible to navigate the noise.</p>
<p>I can only presume others find the same because my interactions fell away to almost zero and micro.blog as a referee to blog posts dropped at an equal rate to completely zero. Could be my face doesn’t fit, could be a million different reasons but another network to try and carve out space in – no thank you.</p>
<p>There is also a real echo chamber on the platform; it is predominantly US-centric. I am not sure of the location of registered accounts, but the feeds and noise always appear very skewed towards American issues. However, this could be linked to discoverability, as it’s impossible to find people to follow without putting in real work – but enough about the negatives.</p>
<p>There are a few positive I have taken away from my year or more on the platform. Where I place my blog in my life is different now. I am more open to publishing my thoughts and less bothered about the length of my posts than I was.</p>
<p>So don’t look for gr36.micro.blog any longer – you won’t find it.</p>

<p>We are in times where spending on social media is at the top of the budget for companies and governments alike. All you need is a few die hard fans, and some half baked truths, coming this with addictive platforms and you have a real problem.</p>
<p>Propaganda has existed for what seems like forever, but now the ‘social’ platforms cash in on your attention without a care of the fall out.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I am sure you don’t need me to tell you how good the AirPods are when compared to more or less anything else on the market. Since the original version hit the market, I’ve had a pair in my ears at some point in the day 80% of the time. They have worked out with me, walked miles with me and I’ve listen to hours upon hours of podcasts. I held off a little, but the new Pro version is a huge improvement – here are some tips and tricks I have picked up so far.</p>

<p>The new AirPods Pro feature buttons instead of an accelerometer that detects your taps. Of course the set up process guides you through new options for media controls but if you don’t pay attention fully it can be hard to work out what’s going on. Think of the button press as a squeeze of the microphone stem, you will feel a small click and an audio response if long pressing. It takes a bit of getting used to if you’ve used the original AirPods, but pretty easy to get used to.</p>
<p>• Single-press: Pause/play<br />
• Double-press: Skip forward<br />
• Triple-press: Skip backward<br />
• Long-press: Switch between noise cancellation and transparency mode.</p>
<h2><strong>Change Noise Cancelling Settings</strong></h2>
<p>The new AirPods pro feature active noice cancelling (ANC) with rubber tips to make a better seal in your ears. ANC can feel a bit strange at times and also shouldn’t be used every situation. Luckily there is a pretty neat ‘transparency’ mode which lets some noice from the outside world through, and also a toggle off.</p>

The change the options, head into the Bluetooth setting when your AirPods are connected. You will see options for both the left and right AirPods button, you can then add in whatever options you wish to cycle through.</p>
<h2><strong>Activating Siri</strong></h2>
<p>We all love shouting “Hey Siri” during a workout or walking down the street, but if you want to set up activating Siri with a press instead of a voice a voice it’s really easy. Head into the Bluetooth settings as above, there is then a range of options for the left and right AirPod button. I have set this up for left to be noise cancelling and right to be Siri.</p>

<p>Rebecca Jennings <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/12/2/20983760/instagram-removing-likes-authenticity">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instagram has a way of flattening lived experiences so that my best years look exactly like my bad ones, and that everything seems pretty good, all the time, for everyone. This, obviously, is not how life works for most people, and ever since Instagram has existed experts have debated what seeing an infinite scroll of other people’s happy moments is doing to our brains.</p></blockquote>
<p>This exact the problem with a platform I used to love so much. Instagram has been taken over by the ego.</p>
<p>It is now simply a place to try and show off what you have and how great your life is (protein: it isn’t). You are not sharing to Instagram for you, you’re doing it to instil jealousy in people that see the photos. It makes them feel terrible, it makes you feel terrible – yet you still do it.</p>

      <p>Notes apps are my kryptonite. I get sucked in quickly, send a few hours getting everything transferred over and use a different one for a few weeks. I’ve pretty much used them all, recently it was <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/using-apple-notes/">a return to Apple Notes</a>, and even more recently I have been <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-i-use-2/">using Agenda </a>for everything. Both of these apps are still great – but for writing out a post, there is nothing quite <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/bear-notes-app/">like Bear</a>.</p><p>Perhaps it’s the beautifully designed writing experience; maybe it’s the powerful exporting options or one of the many other reasons that make Bear green. I just can’t put my finger on why it’s so lovely to use.</p><p>Whether you are jotting down a quick note to yourself or starting a long page of prose, nothing will disturb your writing. Images can be inserted and formatted to your liking, meaning that as you type you will be looking at exactly how the document looks. This won’t make a blind bit of difference to simple notes, but perhaps it’s time to take your notes to the next level!</p><p>The sharing options of this Bear are right up there with a serious writing app. It offers the possibility for exporting the notes you have made in such a wide range of options it might take a while to work out which one you need. With a simple swipe left while viewing a note you can share in Text, Markdown, PDF, HTML, Rich Text, DocX, and if that wasn’t enough you can even export as an image. No more screenshots of your notes to publish on Instagram and Twitter.</p><p>Bear makes everything from writing stories to documents through to just jotting things down to remember a breeze – this is why I keep coming back.</p>

<p>Oliver Haslam <a href="https://www.imore.com/512gb-iphone-11-pro-max-costs-less-500-parts">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Which brings us back to my original point: these figures are interesting. But they can’t tell the whole story.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, a company tears down an iPhone 11 Pro and produces some costing involved. imore write a post about it and now I’m linking to it – all to say that these things don’t matter. I cant work out if I am part of the problem or if it’’s all rubbish anyway.</p>
<p>However that is to say that these sorts of posts come out every time a high profile phone is released and no one really pays attention other than a few publications that are seeking the clicks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This is how companies work, the cost of producing a product is less than the price you sell it for. No one is surprised right?</p>

     <p>Casey Newton noticing Facebooks <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/all-the-most-popular-posts-on-facebook">plagiarism problem</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook’s report details the top 20 most widely viewed posts on the network over the past three months. One of the posts was deleted before Facebook published it. Of the remaining 19, though, only four appear to have been original. The remaining 15 had been published in at least one other place first, and were then re-uploaded to Facebook, sometimes with small changes.</blockquote><p>It’s interesting to think about where people post things and in what order. Instagram Reels is clearly full of TikTok made videos that are redistributed. Which doesn’t seem to matter because they can monetise it anyway, and the same can be said for Facebook itself.</p><p>When the odd breakout personality does exist on Facebook, sure they can make money, but the content has to be <em>very</em> niche. The biggest touted success such as ‘Ladbaby’. Content is <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/inside-ladbabys-jaw-dropping-net-23875864">typical of the people that still use Facebook</a>. Just take a scroll down the <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/data/widely-viewed-content-report/#widely-viewed-content">most viewed pages</a> report, and you will see pages such as “Do You Remember When” and “That ain't right”. Which tells you all you need to know about the people spending the most time using Facebook.</p><p>Communities and groups are one of the biggest drivers of serious Facebook traffic. That same report shows pages such as “The Typical Mom” and “All Things Mamma” raking in 96m and 92m views per quarter. So, clearly there are people using Facebook, and loads of them, but they are not creating content for the site. They are interacting with others, forming groups and seeking advice.</p><p>I have always considered Facebook a bit of a distribution space anyway. Words go on a blog first, videos always got to YouTube first and photos go on Instagram. The fact that the Newsfeed is filled with plagiarism is not really a surprise to anyone.</p>

     <p>Undoubtedly, the biggest thing I was looking forward to with the macOS Monterey update was Shortcuts. It promises to be the final piece in automating the Apple universe. Admittedly, it is a bit hit-and-miss, feeling as if it’s still in beta, but most things work well. My favourite part is pinning Shortcuts to the menu bar, and this is my favourite one.</p>
<p>In creating this Shortcut, I took inspiration from <a href="https://twitter.com/linuz90/status/1458533540673564681?s=20">Gabrizio Rinaldi’s version</a> that I found via <a href="https://birchbark.substack.com/p/the-truth-is-paywalled-but-this-newsletter">The Birchtree Bark Newsletter</a>. However, I wasn’t happy with just starting the screensaver. This is fine if you are working from home, but I work in an office and regulations dictate my workstation must be locked when I am not at it. This took a bit of work as older versions made for Automator no longer work, but step forward some simple Apple script to save the day.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b44f623456.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="944" /></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b493a5f2850541aa8ace73b1bde2d951">Grab it</a></p>
<p>This small shortcut will quit all apps, put the volume down to 0 (no one wants to hear your Mac pinging when you’re at home) and also lock your Mac. You can leave some apps running if you need to by customising the first step in the Shortcut. All you need to do is click on ‘choose’ and select any apps you want to keep running.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/28c29066c4.jpg" alt="" width="1560" height="1398" /></figure>
<p>You will need to give Shortcuts permission to run scripts. Also make sure this is pinned to the menu bar as if you try to run it from within Shortcuts the last part will not work as the app has been killed halfway through!</p>
<p>You are welcome to add in other automations on the end of this, like Gabrizio did, such as switching off HomeKit enabled lights or putting the heating up a bit for when you get home. I debated playing a sound clip to signal me clocking out, but I might use this a few times a day so I didn’t want to annoy myself! It would be great to see what you do, so let me know.</p>
<p>Update: Slight tweek to make sure the whole script can run.</p>

     <p>I know I am not supposed to. Well, I am supposed to, it’s human nature, but I am supposed to hate myself for it. I think that's the way I am supposed to feel about likes on my photos. To be clear, we are talking about Instagram at all times, no other photo service gets the reach that the ‘gram does, and perhaps that's the real travesty here. Yet, I can’t go anywhere else because, according to some, I am an attention seeker.</p><p>Being already hyper conscious of my tendency to <a href="/2021/02/11/needing-feedback.html">crave some response</a> to the things I post online, I should really gravitate towards photo services such as <a href="/2021/12/27/glass-feelings.html">Glass</a>. I’ve gone <a href="/2021/08/24/my-glass-half.html">backwards</a> and <a href="/2021/09/01/refill-my-glass.html">forwards</a> on this excellent service and won’t go into my thoughts here. Needless to say, it just doesn’t provide what I need from a photo service. They are steadfast on not cowering to the social media trope of including likes, but that means a lot of your photos go without anything.</p><p>If the works for you, and is the reason you use Glass or another platform, cool. I wish it didn't mean as much to me, but the only option on Glass is leaving a comment. Which is great i theory, but they mainly devolve into talking or asking questions. Actual feedback is very minimal, and I leave far more than I receive. Leaving questions such as are my photos any good, are they not being seen, does my photo style just not fit? Do I need to keep going or give up completely? Wanting a quick, easy way to give and receive feedback is not a lot to ask.</p><p>I could post my photos to the dumpster fire that is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/photocritique/">/r/photocritique</a>, but I feel if I did, I might give up taking photos completely. Being mostly friendly, unfortunately I have seen users go to town on photos because the subject faced the wrong way, or they didn’t use composition correctly. All feedback that may be needed, but I think I can judge how good my shot is from a tried and tested source — likes.</p><p>Public likes are obviously a contentions subject. Research suggests they are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920307005">terrible for people</a> that begin to use them as a marker to judge themselves. Granted I am not a teenage girl, that seem to be affected the most, but I really like them on my photos. I am not going to spam hashtags to game the system and delete photos that don’t do well, but a small bit of reward goes a long way when you are learning.</p><p>Likes get a bad rep, but the way that Instagram implement them is purely for their gain, not ours. Played like a slot machine to manipulate users of the service to post more and spend more time using the service. However, done correctly, likes <em>could</em> be a useful metric to measure yourself against — although I have not seen them done well on any service yet. The issues are often the humans behind them that seek more and more feedback <a href="/2020/09/01/the-trickle-down.html">in an attention economy</a> — again coming back to Facebook.</p><p>Perhaps likes are not the issue, it’s Facebook, but there may never be an answer. Certainly, not one that suits everyone, so I am still not sure how I feel about them.</p>

     <p>I’ve been learning photography for around 4 years now. I love looking back, sometimes through hands covering my face, at old photos I have taken and seeing my progression over time. It is one of those skills, like writing consistently, that seems like it should be effortless but in fact is reasonably complicated. I’ve had <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/other-peoples-trash-can/">frustrating times</a> when it’s been a struggle to keep motivated, but I haven’t acquired these new skills by buying something.</p><p>All I want to be is a good photographer. That's all I really want from life. Take photos, edit, and go to interesting places that allow me to do those things. When I started, deciding it was time to stop using my phone and buy a ‘proper camera’, I wanted the best thing available. Spending hours reading all over the internet, having a look at what I could afford, and pushing my budget further and further up. I decided eventually that wasn’t the right move, and spent a lot of time with a small Sony A5000 before moving up the range.</p><blockquote>Learn how to do the things you want to do instead of buying things hoping it will allow you to do the thing you want to do. — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq4xfqZCp6yt0Q_GcHY9AZg">Patrick Tomasso</a></blockquote><p>I still get these feeling now. The number of times I have thought “that lens would make my images so much better” I prefer not to admit. When in fact I don’t need to buy anything, I just needed to practice, review and learn the skills needed. Buying a thing doesn’t get you anywhere, new <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-new-productivity/">apps don’t make you more productive</a>, new platforms don’t make you write more, and buying things is just an endless loop.</p><p>Purchasing instead of learning gets you nowhere apart from deeper in debt. You don’t need to spend anything to become something, just time and effort — which is perhaps the most expensive thing you own. I wanted to become a good photographer (I still do) but there is nothing I can buy to make me one.</p>

     <p>Alex Kantrowitz <a href="https://bigtechnology.substack.com/p/the-case-to-reform-the-share-button?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0Njc5MDc5NiwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDM1ODU3NTEsIl8iOiJWZjcxRiIsImlhdCI6MTYzNjU0OTczOSwiZXhwIjoxNjM2NTUzMzM5LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItNDY1MTAiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.kJms87_1fzGpbtWQa7cClkdQT-SV6FomTvg4SPGIWOc"> reforming the Share Button </a>:</p><blockquote>A simple product tweak, the research indicated, would likely help Facebook constrain its misinformation problem more than an army of content moderators — all without removing a single post. In this scenario, adding some friction after the first share, or blocking sharing altogether after one share, could help mitigate the spread of misinformation on Facebook.</blockquote><p>Seems like another day, another revelation from the ‘Facebook Files’ and I am sure there are lots more to come. You can of course push back and claim that the leaks were of information gleamed from internal documents and not form actually decision makers but it’s clear that they reflect the overall nature of the beats.</p><p>When it comes to misinformation, <em>internal</em> Facebook research noted that people are at least 4x more likely to see misinformation from a shares post. That is that if the original post users see is from outside of their friends list is four times more likely to be false, and up to 20 times in some situations. Lets that just sink in for a moment.</p><p>Two years ago, Facebook discovered that users were seeing false information shared into their newsfeed and apparently did nothing about it. The research goes on to make a recommendation that adding friction to sharing or blocking sharing all together would help mitigate the issues they were facing. Whilst it’s not known for sure if <em>any</em> action was taken, employees did openly discuss the findings on internal systems, it is clear they did not make any meaningful changes.</p>

     <p>In July of this year, I <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/07/09/a-quick-check/">quit twitter for the longest I ever have done</a>. It was only about two weeks, but I did it properly this time, <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/07/08/deactivated-twitter/">deactivated my account</a> and everything. I can see your expression from here, I know this isn't an achievement to be lauded up, but it was pretty good for me. Having started to pull back in March, I had finally had enough. Every time I have tried to do it before, I failed. Finding myself checking the web app at least once a day. In many instances, I also just replaced Twitter with another social media platform, <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/03/28/why-microblog/">usually micro.blog</a>.</p><p>Granted, I am using Twitter again, but reading <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/books/deep-work-rules-for-focused-success-in-a-distracted-world/9780349411903">Deep Work</a> by Call Newport is making me want to pull back again. Perhaps not from everything like the extreme examples given in the book, but I find myself nodding along to the majority of the points raised. There is no doubt I experience some side effects discussed. All the signs are there. Struggling to focus sometimes, getting distracted by simple things, massive procrastination, the list goes on.</p><p>Frustratingly, this should have been already obvious having read <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/books/the-shallows-how-the-internet-is-changing-the-way-we-think-read-and-remember/9781838952587">The Shallows</a> some years ago. I am becoming convinced that the modern connected world is running my brain, but I need it so much that I couldn’t even dream of long periods of deep work away from it all. I can’t put this all on social media, though. My, and in fact everyone's, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-fix-email-science">relationship to email is broken</a>. The unwritten expectation of swift replies has tormented me into time blocking my day to periods when I deal with email. Pushing everything else to the extremities does a lot for the work that I love.</p><p>There is no better feeling of contentment than becoming engrossed in a task you enjoy. Focussing on a topic you relish engaging with, otherwise why do it, and having no distractions to bring you out of flow state. Time disappears and projects get completed, simply by removing the triggers. Long ago, I accepted that I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-cant-go/">can’t go back</a> to simpler times, but I can make my time simpler. I can go deeper into tasks and I get far more enjoyment from doing so. Not only from completing the task at hand, but more enjoyment when I do surface.</p><p>Roll this out to family time and other tasks that I love doing like photography and not only am I more engaged with what’s in front of me I am also enjoying social media more (email still sucks).</p>

The gatekeepers of publications — the printers, the producers and the large corporations — no longer have the hold they once had. Information can spread wider and faster than it ever has before. Unfortunately, with that power shift come the, as Charlie calls them, Grifters. Those that aim to leverage this new power of publication and use it for their gains.</p><p>Anyone with access to the internet and publication skills now has an unnatural reach around the globe.

I am not sure what the answer to the misinformation issue. It may be more journalism, more publishing and better independence from social platforms. One thing I do know is that if these issues are not stemmed soon the future will look back on this period with distain and laugh at how stupid we all were.</p>

     <p>The sheer number of repos I have on <a href="https://github.com/gr36">GitHub</a> containing blog themes in various states of repair is a testament to my personality. Despite having been writing on the internet for more than a decade, I am never happy with what I have and spend too much time messing around with things instead of pushing out posts. Others get these feelings too, something I am calling blog envy.</p><p>I look at blog designs like <a href="https://birchtree.me">Birchtree.me</a> and think to myself “I want a blog like that” and then go out and try to build one. Setting up a new local installation of Ghost, or WordPress, or whatever the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/why-micro-blog/">thing at the time</a> is I think I need to have. Of course, a few hours in I have something that looks somewhat like my inspiration but more like a cheap man's imitation. Importing posts and fixing things take a few more hours, when infact I should have spent those hours doing something more constructive.</p><p>There is no doubt that I have picked up some skills in doing this, a fact that was put to the test when building <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/a-new-home/">my new home</a>, but it was still a lot of time wasted. I am often reminded of a <a href="https://www.nitinkhanna.com/dont-moleskine-your-blog/">post by Nitin Khanna</a> that expanded on an idea by Jeff Perry. It is a post well worth reading, unfortunately the original inspiration has been lost to Jeff’s restless blog syndrome, but if you will allow me to paraphrase a little. It draws parallels between not wanting to ruin a nice, expensive notebook with subpar notes, to playing with your blog so much you never write on it. Something I know a <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/i-need-to/">little about!</a></p><p>I shouldn't beat myself up that much, but I see it in loads of others that spend money moving things about and getting nowhere apart from deeper in debt. Jealousy is not a bad emotion to have about the results of someone’s hard work and years’ worth of effort. However, the response is emulating the effort put in and not worry about the design or the way they do things. Not least because if you do finally achieve the emulation you desire, it won’t be yours anyway.</p><p>Spending hours creating a website is fine, if you have something to put on there in the first place. When creating this very website I tried out loads of awesome designs but when push came to shove they just didn’t reflect me. My blog is an <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/my-blog-is-an-extension-of-me/">extension of me</a>, and I shouldn’t be jealous of others because they are not me.</p>

The M1 Pro keyboard sounds different, has stronger feedback and actuation accuracy, and has smaller function-keys.</blockquote><p>I am no mechanical keyboard aficionado, but I love having a keyboard with the right amount of tactile feedback. There is something about having good key travel and a reassuring press that makes me feel at home.</p><p>It is remarkable how much faster I type, how more accurate I am, and just how much more I want to write on a good keyboard. I am sure there his some science behind it, but I am not sure how I would even sum it all up adequately. As I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/can-you-stop-messing-around-with-keyboards-now/">wrote about previously</a>, the butterfly keyboards I used were fine, the return to scissor switches was of course better — but the new MacBook Pros’ keyboards are superb.</p>

     <p>There were certain periods in my life where I was so ingrained into the world of technology that nothing else entered my mind. I was working in it all day, then writing and talking about it all night. It was my 'thing' and I enjoyed it, but I was boring. Sure, I loved being around cutting-edge technology, getting the inside scoop on loads of new things coming before the market did, but there comes a point where you're just not a well-rounded person any more.</p><p>I was for all intents and purposes <a href="https://gr36.com/2017/10/24/not-being-a/">a 'fanboy'</a>. The things I used where such a part of me that I felt I had found my tribe, and I was absolutely going to tell everyone about it. First it was Android because I chose to use Googles OS and not that stupid fruit one, my calling was to argue the point on almost everything there was about it. My friends all asked me for tech advice, came to me to know things, and I preached my calling to all that would listen.</p><p>My <a href="https://gr36.com/2020/11/14/my-journey-to/">journey to Apple</a> was a long and boring one, but I don't feel like I needed to be like I was when I used Android. Now I am part of the Goliath and not fighting with my fellow Davids. That was until the iPad Air 2 came along. When handed one for my job, it had to quickly become my everything. On my journey to <a href="https://gr36.com/2017/02/19/one-year-of/">tweak and bend the iPad to work for me,</a> I defended it as if it were my child. Because I was so invested in the whole ecosystem around working on an iPad, it became a part of me, and in many ways I was an "iPad guy" before many of the people currently looked up to even started. I was in before it was cool!</p><p>I got emotional when people like <a href="https://randomdumber.blogspot.com/2017/06/joshua-topolsky-trashes-ipad-as.html">Joshua Topolsky</a> trashed by beloved iPad, and defended it to the death. It was in fact when using an iPad <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/today-is-the/">became too much</a> I that I began to see that others may have a point too. My passion for something was blinding me to see anything else. When in fact there are far too many reasons behind what tools we use and things we buy that others may never understand. In much the case, we as content creators often feel the need to defend or explain our purchasing decisions to people that consume our things for reasons I still don’t understand myself.</p><p>Now my tools mean very little to me. Sure, I have strong preferences towards iPhones and particularly macOS, but they are <a href="https://gr36.com/2019/06/11/im-not-an/">not part of me any longer</a>. I love technology, and mainly stick to Apple products as I know them the best, but I can't be as evangelical for them as I used to be able to. In many respects the tribalism we feel is natural, no one likes things they love receiving negativity but it gets a bit much after a point. Use what you use and be happy.</p>

     <p>At the same point each year, my wife and I get into the same discussion. It’s a few weeks until my birthday, and she wants to buy me presents. So, we have the same circular conversation that I don’t want nor need anything, and she tries all sorts of tactics to get me to give in.</p>
<p>My wife shares a viewpoint with most of the world, in that the volume of stuff or expenditure is equal to the amount you care about someone. She thinks that if I don’t receive anything, then I will be disappointed, and no amount of reassurance seems to matter.</p>
<p>I will concede that some of my issues with my birthday are deep-rooted phycological weirdness. For example, I do not believe birthdays are anything special and seem like a celebration for nothing. You are not achieving anything by being on a rock that has gone around the sun any more. No, I don’t know what my parents did to me as a child!</p>
<p>However, I hate stuff, and cluttering up my life with things I do not really need and have just thought up to make someone happy is a nightmare. So, I will have the conversation year-on-year, forever…</p>

     <p>I know at some point in my life I am going to have to let you go. I pray that is not for a very long time. There were years before you arrived, but I don’t remember them clearly. When you were born, it was as if I were born again and have lived another, better life with you. I know you were given to me to teach me about the world, and I promised to show you it.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7ec25892e9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When we sat up at nights, we talked. You never said anything back to me, but you spoke to me for all those hours. When most people would be yearning for their bed, I needed you in my arms as much as you needed me close to you. To hold and protect you. For you to teach me about myself.</p>
<p>There will be a time when these moments will go, and I will die a little. You have made me who I am today, my special little girl. I am your legs, your body, and your words, and I will not fail you. You are my eyes now, for I see the world with you for as long as it will let us be together. The world is far too big for you at the moment, but that won&rsquo;t be the case forever…just not yet.</p>

     <p>When typing out my thoughts and going well past a short tweet, I thought for longer than I should have about the title of this post. I like to give them a snappy title that sums everything up. The most logical word to use for this would be engagement, but like productivity, that word is ruined now.</p><p>It shouldn’t be. It is the reason I use social media and the driving motivation to stick around on Twitter when logically I should leave it behind. Talking to people and engaging with others <em>is</em> the point, after all, social media without the social part is pretty pointless. Yet, we all base its importance on numbers and stats that mean nothing.</p><p>I must admit that I still don’t really ‘get’ social media. I’ve never been able to crack that part of my marketing brain and really push on to succeed in that world. Mainly because all the ‘engagement’ stats that people measure against mean nothing to me. Likes, hearts, clicks, all that kind of stuff just don’t matter to me. The people behind them do, and it’s so sad that all the importance of social media seems to be dying apart from these things.</p><p>My followers have fluctuated between 1,900 and 2,500 for years. Loads of bots pump it up for a bit, and then Twitter sorts it out and deletes loads of them. I’m not a popular figure in the slightest, but the replies that I get are from a cross-section of roughly 30 people. A small sliver of the people who are supposedly following me and interested in what I have to say. Again, at risk of sounding ungrateful, this number means nothing to me, but the people do, so where are they?</p><p>Why has Twitter died so much, to a point that interactions are few and far between? Since the whole Elon thing, it seems as if once great Twitter users can’t be bothered any more. Myself included. Much like the job market struggles, perhaps the pandemic has made people realise that all this superficial stuff doesn’t matter any more and their time is worth more. I can only speculate, but many of the <em>real</em> people seem to have gone.</p><p>The enjoyment I take from tweeting seems to becoming less and less. I thought for a long time this was me, I wasn’t engaging enough and no one was interested in this old dude any more. As time has gone on, I realised the reason I tweeted less and less was because others were tweeting less and finding similar struggles.</p><p>At least that what I am telling myself, or maybe I am just old and don’t get it any more.</p>

<p>Not because she did anything special, or achieved anything anywhere near the markers that “normal” kids set down. But myself, my wife and son sat at a pub and had an enjoyable few hours.

     <p>My motivation to do, well, anything, comes in waves. At some points, <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/07/27/210805.html">particularly lately</a>, I can’t be bothered to write, run or do the things that I know I should do. However, I also know that these are the days that will make the most difference to me. I will improve the most struggling through the hard days and make sure the easy days feel much better.</p>
<p>I <em>know</em> these things, but that doesn’t mean I can always drag myself towards <em>doing</em> these things. Every so often I just can’t be bothered to do anything, I don’t feel the need to hack every waking moment of my life and maximise everything. Occasionally, I just want to let the motivation slip away and smash it again another day.</p>
<p>It sucks, being on Struggle Street, but I am happy in the knowledge that it always gets better. There is always and end to the empty feelings and lack of motivation when the colour returns to the world. So keep going, my friends, and I’ll see you at the end.</p>

<p>Bigger phones are popular mostly because they are a computer replacement for a lot of people. As we do more and more on these devices a lot people want the biggest screen they can afford but there will always be those that just want something manageable (to them). - <a href="https://ljpuk.net/2022/08/26/there-is-no-ideal-size-of-smartphone/">Lee Peterson</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lee gets it spot on here, for a lot of people there only device is a smartphone and it makes perfect sense to have the biggest and best you can use. However there are a lot of people, myself and Lee included, that just want a device that gets out the way.</p>
<p>For a long time I have thought the perfect screen size was around 5", or a device around the size and weight of the iPhone 7. However people like myself have to accept that the world wants bigger whereas I’d rather <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/12/08/putting-in-some.html">put some barriers in the way</a> to my screen time.</p>

     <p>As with everything tech related, when I start to see similar thoughts and ideas shared online, I am never sure what the motivation is. Could it be that several people have come to a shared conclusion at the same point, or are marketing departments gearing up for something? Of course, it’s building up to that time of year when we all talk about iPads.</p><p>The simple answer when debating the authenticity of anything is to consult independent publishing, aka read personal blogs. So, when Robert Rackley posted <a href="https://frostedechoes.net/minimal-mac/">Minimal Mac</a>, I knew that for one reason or another the strange feelings that I currently have around my MacBook are shared.</p><blockquote>Multitasking is bullshit. I can’t help but roll my eyes whenever someone comes with a fancy talk around the necessity of having multiple displays or app windows opened at the same time and all the time. — <a href="https://frostedechoes.net/minimal-mac/">Minimal Mac</a></blockquote><p>For many weeks, I has already decided that <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/08/19/getting-away.html">during my week away</a> at the beach, I wanted to avoid taking my laptop. I’d be taking loads of photos and would no doubt do some publishing, but I wanted all trace of work put away for a few days. The answer, of course, was to take my <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/08/18/all-work-and.html">creative computer</a> aka my iPad Pro. I don’t <a href="https://gr36.com/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html">work on it</a> any more, and it has been a long time since I even used one properly, so the timing is perfect.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/07f6c1814b.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>So, I snapped on a magic keyboard, and took the most laptop like iPad away with me and used it exclusively for a week. Well, I used it a bit, this was a holiday after all. There are still some frustrations, none of which will be fixed by the upcoming iOS16 introduction of new app windowing. Infact nothing has really changed from the iPad that I left behind three years ago, but I think my expectation <em>have</em> changed.</p><p>As I type out this post back at home on my Mac, I realise how much calmer iOS is when you expect nothing of it. I wasn’t looking for a do it all machine, I was looking for it to do a few simple tasks, and do them well. There’s just something so brilliant about using one app at a time and nothing else. No more trying to fit a round peg in a square hole and expecting the iPad to be a desktop computer. Much more than this, the iPad delivered a small space of calm and straightforward usage — just like it always has.</p><p>Perhaps Apple is trying to deliver what its users want and are working hard to deliver the next generation of device. Or perhaps there is just more expectation from an iPad with an M1 chip that costs almost £1000. Whatever the reason is that the iPad Pro seems to never deliver what is expected of it, when you want calm and easy to use, iOS is where you find it.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>For the last few weeks, I have been struggling with what to do with the posts I want to publish. With my <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/08/24/back-in-the.html">renewed motivation</a> to do a bit more, and also publish <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/">more photos,</a> the sensible thing is to sort this out now. As it stands currently I have <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/">a blog</a> and a <a href="https://gr36.com">micro.blog</a>, and the lines are getting blurry.</p><p>I have long ago given up the idea that my writing will be popular or even widely read, but I love having a nice blog just for me to publish my thoughts and feelings. If one person reads it, then that’s a bonus. If they take something away from it, apart from knowledge not to visit again, then perfect. I love publishing anything that comes to mind, and in that sense, just having one blog makes perfect sense.</p><p>I have <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/03/28/why-microblog.html">been here before</a>, when I just wanted a place to type something out and hit publish. Despite my insistence that things have changed, I moved back to Ghost soon after and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-new-home/">made a new home</a>. So, I have more than a bit of trepidation on going all in on one blog yet again, given that neither of the places do a good job of fulfilling both of these post types.</p><p>Ghost really doesn’t work well with posts having no title and no support of any open web standards. Whereas my micro.blog is nearly always breaking, or not doing something quite right. Something I'm not really concerned about with smaller posts, but I like to publish something if I have half a mind to do so.</p><p>If it was possible to move my Ghost posts over, I would have a test on how micro.blog would look, but that doesn’t work either. I will probably mess around with two spaces for a lot longer, until I lose the motivation to think about it any longer.</p>

<p>Creativity is a habit. - <a href="https://dazne.net/work/">Do the Work</a>, Danze</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve fallen into a bit of a rabbit hole with <a href="https://dazne.net">Rishabh Dassani</a> as it seems each of their posts speaks to me on some level or another. Giving me little bits of advice in productivity, organisation and life.</p>
<p>Some of the points outlined in Do the work have reminded me of things I have discovered myself and then let slip. I need to start <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/sitting-in-the/">sitting in the chair</a> again and making my creativity a habit. My inspiration and <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/07/27/the-good-news.html">motivation to publish</a> come in waves but only when I put the work in do I really make strides in publishing my thoughts and clearing my mind.</p>
<p>I write because I enjoy the <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/08/25/writing-consistently.html">process of writing</a> and hitting publish is just a nice outcome.</p>

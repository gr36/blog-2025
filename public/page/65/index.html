  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It was a very quick thought that flowed through one day when writing out <a href="https://email.gr36.com/archive/greg-thinks-things-33/">edition 33 of my newsletter</a>. A fleeting emotion that struck me when I was thinking about what had happened that week. A week where I had mourned not having a camera around, and not been able to do what I enjoyed. It was strange how not having <em>one thing</em> in my possession pulled on my strings that I ever anticipated, and felt somewhat embarrassing to admit to publicly.</p><p>In April this year<a href="/2021/04/19/i-feel-like.html"> I chose to sell my A7iii camera</a> due to lack of use, and wanting to slim down my possessions to a level that I was happy with. I am a minimalist, but sometimes I forget and tend to have to go through a purge every now and again to calm things down. I felt a huge pang when delivering it to its new owner, but due to <a href="/2021/03/26/saying-goodbye-to.html">seeing no end in sight</a> of the pandemic knew I couldn’t leave it gathering dust much longer. Since then I didn’t think much of it, until two weeks ago.</p><p>Our progression out of periodic lockdowns has progressed dramatically over the last couple of months. Now things <em>are</em> opening back up, I have more opportunity to get out and about. Had I known things would go this fast I perhaps would not have chosen to sell so soon, but I digress. This thought of not having a camera, made me feel quite sad. It is silly to get emotional over a possession, but this one in particular signified an important part of my personality and for that I mourned more than a little.</p><p>For fear of repeating myself, there is just something about holding and using a camera that means a lot to me. As good as lenses and sensors get in smartphones (and I have used loads of them) they just can’t compete in my eyes. Are there loads of people more talented than me? Sure, but in my head I am a photographer (my editing sucks a bit though) but not having a camera made me not feel like one anymore. Even more so saying it out load.</p><p>I am glad to say that my wife got fed up of me talking about it, thinking about it, and of course procrastinating, and bought me an A7c (my reasoning for not buying another A7iii is too long to go into) and I can’t wait to get it. I’m planning on shooting more street things and documenting my increased traveling so this compact FF shooter should be perfect. I also feel like I have a bit of myself back — I am never doing this again.</p><p>Want to contribute <a href="https://www.wexphotovideo.com/sigma-100-400mm-f5-6-3-contemporary-dg-dn-os-lens-sony-e-fit-1743467">towards a new lens</a> 😆</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Recently myself and my wife were talking about death. Nothing happened, it’s just the weird way our minds work and we often end up walking down strange conversational paths, and this one was no different. We both have very different view points on passing on, and although I have no ability to affect the way others feel or what they do after I go, I know one thing for sure — no sadness.</p><p>My words were along the lines of “if any of you lot wear black to my funeral I will haunt you”. Which is my tongue in cheek way of making my point that although I am sure you are sad I am gone, please celebrate the time I was here. I’m not egotistical enough to claim everyone should feel blessed I was in their lives, but please be happy of the legacy I leave behind. Even if it is dad jokes and bad blog posts. Be happy you had something and not sad it’s gone.</p><p>Then it suddenly hit me. This is exactly the opposite of what I have been doing about working from home. I have been moping around and morning <a href="/2021/06/20/work-and-home.html">the loss of WFH</a> instead of being happy that I had the opportunity to experience it for more than a year. I had no right to work from home, but had an excellent experience that I was lucky to have. An experience, during a pandemic, that many did not have and their lives have changed for the worse because of it.</p><p>Like a marriage break up or a loss, I am happy that I managed to have this experience. I really enjoyed it, I am more than open to returning to something like it in the future and in actual fact I will strive to achieve it. However I realise that I am not entitled to work from home, there are many benefits to being in a more social environment. Although I do need lots of <a href="/2018/11/13/im-an-outgoing.html">down time to recharge my batteries</a>, I like being able to work collectively in person as it suits me well.</p>

<p>It’s no wonder people are working longer, earlier, later, on weekends, and whenever they have a spare moment. People can’t get work done at work anymore. Work claws away at life. Life has become work’s leftovers. The doggy bag. The remnants. The scraps.</p>
<p>I am constantly surprised by the level of work some people seem to put in. This seems a very American thing, and perhaps they are mostly chasing the American dream, but the level of life that their work takes up is frankly ridiculous. Spending 12 hour days at work and then being expected to work weekends and also slave away with no paid holiday (vacation for America readers) seems so weird.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with hustling when it’s needed but it doesn’t have to be the standard to succeed surely. Work to live, don’t live to work is the age old saying but as technology takes on more and more of the slack, why exactly are people working more and more?</p>

<p>One of my most enjoyable newsletters is <a href="https://tablethabit.com/">Tablet Habit</a> by Jeff Perry, particularly because I am <a href="/2021/06/23/force-some-ipad.html">diving back into the world again</a> and using my iPad for everything. I have been lucky enough to be linked by him a few times and it always makes me feel very humble.</p>
<p>I never feel <a href="/2020/01/22/i-dont-feel.html">interesting enough to be linked to</a> and frankly never expect my things to be read, but after years of doing it you would think that my thoughts would have changed towards myself. Don’t get me wrong I have had periods in my life where my ego has gotten away with more than it should, but I think its important to always remain at least a little bit grounded.</p>
<p>However my feelings are different. I am amazed when people say they read my things and it still feels weird even after a decade.</p>

<p>This week, Jeff Bezos went to space. I am not interested enough to get emotional about it, although <a href="https://500ish.com/hold-out-those-great-hopes-b43816657a7c">some people are</a>. I am also not going to use this to launch into an anti-Amazon tirade, because I could. I have simply been thinking that I long for a time when people with loads of money gave it back.</p>
<p>In my youth, multi-millionaires spent their wealth building public buildings, donating to schools and putting their name on things that helped. All they seemed to want was to massage their ego with a library named after them, not disappear into the sky inside a phallic shaped rocket. People of the UK became used to Richard Branson trying to go <a href="https://www.wickersworld.co.uk/the-ballooning-exploits-of-richard-branson/">around the world every now and again</a>, but the rest of them were benefactors to things that made our community better.</p>
<p>I am sure Bezos et al do give money away but it makes you really think when they pull stunts like this. Its become a meme that they could fix world hunger but instead choose to do x, but maybe its time they become accountable for something. Instead of launching something into orbit, or trying to get to Mars, they take a look around and choose something to fix because there are plenty of things on this planet that need attention.</p>

      <p>One of my favorite things to do is read through all the items I have saved throughout the day to my articles. It gives me time to wind down and usually gives me something to think about, and where most of my <a href="https://gr36.com/categories/link-posts/">link posts</a> come from. Unfortunately I can’t find anything that reliably shares any highlight I make to Obsidian, although things are <a href="https://github.com/nybbles/obsidian-pocket">in the making</a>, so I made a Shortcut.</p><p>Pocket have changed the way that articles are shared out of the app recently and make this much more accessible instead of hiding the URL. This Shortcut isn’t the most aesthetically pleasing I am sure it could be done better, but it works! All you need to do is highlight the quote you want to save, then select share via and tap the Shortcut.</p><p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d4ef604b0adf40b8a223a20259d434fb">Get it here</a></p><p>App needed: You will need to download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/toolbox-pro-for-shortcuts/id1476205977">Tool Box Pro</a> at the moment because Shortcuts is unable to save files outside of the Shortcuts folder in iOS14 and earlier.</p><h2 id="to-set-this-up-in-tool-box-pro">To set this up in Tool Box Pro</h2><p>Head into setting, then set up a folder bookmark as your obsidian folder. Then in the Shortcut select the folder bookmark you have set up. Hopefully you wont need this much longer, and I will update the shortcut when iOS15 comes out.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/heyyoudvd/">heyyoudvd</a> replying to a thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/om130b/why_do_apples_media_services_apps_suck_so_bad/">Why do Apple’s media services apps suck so bad?</a>:</p>
<p>This was the single biggest fear I had with Apple getting into the content business, and it’s coming to fruition. When you become a services company, you are financially incentivized to sell your services. You’re incentivized to put your content ahead of your end user experience.</p>
<p>That’s why the Music and TV apps feel like giant ads. Instead of providing you with tools to organize, arrange, and sift through your content, these apps are built like giant billboards, advertising the next movie and the next album that they want you to consume. It’s not about what you want to watch or listen to; it’s about what content <em>they want to push on you</em>.</p>
<p>The surprising thing from this thread is the fact that so many people don’t realise this. It’s the reason that most things from Apple are average at best and no where near the level of innovation they were in the past. When you reach a certain level of revenue and have overwhelming responsibilities to share holders, your outlook becomes much wider than it once was.</p>
<p>As Seth Goodin <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/seth-godin-new-business-5-step-fdb354988c23">would say</a> you have to start making “average products for average people”. You are no longer interested in creating great products for your fans, but need to look at larger and larger audiences and as such become vanilla.</p>
<p>Apple no longer makes iPhones, Macs, iPad, apps and everything else for <em>you</em>. It makes them for everyone.</p>
<p>The service example used here is a perfect one, there is no incentive to make the best app on the market any longer. If you’re Apple there <em>is</em> a huge incentive to make one that pushes its wears in your face. Apple no longer even conforms to its own rules for apps, and only upholds its App Store rules for some companies and not others. All in the pursuit of income and you, as users, should not be surprised.</p>
<p>Users hold up revenue figures and ridiculous numbers of iPhones sold as a badge of honor and then are surprised when it comes back to bite them in the ass. You don’t get it both ways I’m afraid.</p>

<p>Chris Hannah on the <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://chrishannah.me/weeds-are-subjective/">subjectivity of weeds</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, when reading a product review, whether it’s an app or a computer, it’s important to remember that a weed to them might not necessarily be a weed to you. So you need to take into consideration any biases that the reviewer might hold themselves, before applying their findings to your situation.</p></blockquote>
<p>This comes up a lot when talking about iPads as Chris points out but also absolutely anything that you can form an opinion on. One of the most important skills is to figure out where the other person is coming from, any biases that have an affect of their opinions. As well as other deciding factors.</p>
<p>I often find when looking at reviews the cons pointed out don’t really matter to me, or seem harsh and more often than not some of the features that they enjoy don’t work in a way that I need. A weed is only a weed of you don’t want it there.</p>

<p>I feel like I am cutting more things out of my life than I am putting in at the minute, but its a journey that is proving ever beneficial. Amazon have annoyed me to such a stage that I am removing my reliance on them completely, a task that unfortunately is proving more difficult that I first anticipated. So much so that I have almost given up a couple of times but I am slowly managing to find other options.</p>
<p>Purchases are pretty easy to remove, I just find everything somewhere else. The only downside is delivery and expectations. I have been a Prime subscriber for years now and as such order everything from Amazon. They stock almost everything, at a great price, with free delivery and a slick distribution and returns network — there is no equal and perhaps that is part of the problem.</p>
<p>Prime is now canceled, I never watched the TV anyway, but other stores that sell items have no where near the level of service that Amazon do. So expectations need to be dampened a little, and hopefully that may mean I might buy less stuff! I have found a local place to collect my dog food from at regular intervals, and this weekend found a place that offers the last few bits we had on a subscription with Amazon. I am supporting more local businesses now than ever and hate myself for relying on Amazon for so long instead of doing a bit of work and finding other places.</p>
<p>Due to their incompetence Amazon have lost around £200 from me already this month as I have purchased all business needed from somewhere else, and will continue to loose around £45 per month not including one off purchases from now on. Don’t get me wrong the company doesn’t give a damn about me dumping them, they told me as much themselves, but if more people do then it may cause a dent.</p>
<p>I just need to purchase a different E-Reader and Kindle will be the last one to go. I purchased a physical book for the first time in years yesterday! Fun times.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I wrote about deactivating my account on this <a href="https://email.gr36.com/archive/gtt-31/">weeks newsletter</a> sent out on Thursday. It is something I need to do, if only to prove to myself I can. Without going in to too much detail I just want to break the habit of scrolling through it all the time — read the newsletter for more words on it. Anyway I digress.</p><p>I decided to log in today, not because I opened it in habit, but because I needed to contact someone and had forgotten their number. I discovered that all of my followers have gone, and all of the people i was following have also been removed — which was a surprise but gave me a perfect moment of clarity.</p><p>There seems little point carrying on with Twitter now. I can’t really be bothered to put in any work following people again and curating my account. My first thought was that this may give me the ‘fresh start’ I wanted, but once I checked in on a few people I quickly realised I would simply end up following the same people as before and nothing much has changed.</p><p>The same topics are going around, the same poor quality trending topics are still trending, and generally I felt absolutely nothing. I wondered if this was doing the right thing logging back in again, but turns out it has actually put me off even more. I havn’t missed out on anything, the real people that I have found have reached out or not bothered. The news that I once loved to follow flows almost straight on to blogs etc so the RSS feeds I follow surface everything I need.</p><p>I feel a little bit as if I am standing in the corner of a party refusing to talk to people like some unsociable idiot but checking in actually helped me frame things in my mind better. Where as I always thought I would go back and join in in some way, now I do not see myself returning. I changed my imagery and deleted all of my tweets to really signify this intention.</p><p>I want my page to be there for a while. With the sight realisation I may be speaking to soon, I don’t see my self going back. If I decide to one day then it will be because I really want to start again and at the moment there is no value in that.</p>

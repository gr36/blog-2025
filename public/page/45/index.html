     <p>Today was very much beach day. Not because the weather was great (it was OK but not great), but simply because we would rather not do anything. We don’t have the luxury of being somewhere exotic so we have to make do with the English beaches. We sat in the waves for a few hours and enjoyed ourselves none the less.</p>

     <p>I woke up this morning with a need to take some photos. No idea why, but it wouldn’t go away so I took my x100v when I walked the dog.</p>

<p>However it just didn’t cut it, so I took my XT3 and walked around for an hour or so in the early sunshine.</p>

<p>What could have been a terrible sleep deprived morning turned into one of the most awe inspiring experiences I have had for a while.</p>

     <p>Around this time last year, I gave up my work iMac Pro and began working on my personal MacBook Pro. In many ways, this was the best decision I have ever made because I can take my computer wherever I am in the office and also plug it into a monitor when I am working at home. Yet, my work and my creative life have never felt the same since.</p><p>I <a href="/2021/06/23/force-some-ipad.html">spoke at the time</a> of the deep cross-overs that these two areas of my life were having. Pondering over the use of an iPad for my personal life to introduce a bit of calm. This experiment didn’t last very long due to various factors including the iPad no longer working, but the idea is sound and given my <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/07/27/210805.html">recent struggles</a> is something I want to explore again.</p><p>What really tipped me over the edge towards iOS adoption again was a couple of excellent posts by Josh Ginter. Since March, he has been keeping a <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2022/03/28/keeping-a-separate-creativity-computer/">separate creativity computer</a> (an iPad Pro) due to being in a similar situation as myself. I hadn’t quite realised that the feelings he felt were the same ones swirling in my head until reading this. Indeed, he has become a proponent of a <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2022/06/17/keeping-a-separate-well-everything/">separate creative everything</a>, to build walls between personal and professional.</p><p>It makes perfect sense and drawing parallels in my photography life, I simply have to keep a separate ‘work’ and <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/06/01/keep-it-simple.html">family camera</a>. So with my work kindly supplying a new iPad for me to use, the experiment is on once again. I am hoping that the calmness and tendency for me to use one app at a time will give me some creative spark and allow me to <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/11/10/going-deeper.html">work a bit deeper</a> on the tings I enjoy.</p>

     <p>I didn’t, as I suspected, renew my Glass subscription just <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/08/for-the-sake.html">for the sake of it</a> I cancelled and deleted my account. Nothing personal and I know people around here love it, but the cost was not worth it.</p>
<p>I still can’t really figure out why but this description from Marc does a good job of summing some feelings up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Glass seemed to be somewhat of a monoculture. This makes sense: everyone in the app is rich enough to own an iPhone, probably also owns an expensive dedicated camera, a laptop (probably a MacBook) capable of editing them, and has enough discretionary income to pay a monthly subscription to a social media platform. This is boring.&rdquo; - <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2021/09/01/glass-half-empty/">Marc Wickens</a></p></blockquote>
<p>There are entirely too many places to share <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/">photos</a> and micro.blog + a bit of Twitter suits me fine. Maybe even some <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/16/ive-konmarie-my.html">Instagram</a>, who knows.</p>

     <p>When you are a child, you dream of huge, almost magical things happening in your life. The future is filled with so many, almost endless, possibilities that all those fantasies and aspirations don’t seem so hard to achieve. Yet for some reason all of that magic seems to fade as you get older, and you have to start being a bit more realistic, but it's really boring.</p><p>It’s a bit of a Meme now that all children want to be famous before they know what they would like to be famous for. There shouldn’t be much push back because this is understandable. These people are ones they look up to early in their life and as such the pinnacle of their world.</p><p>It’s easy to be dismissive of this. When children want to be YouTubers or play games for a living, it is just a modern-day version of what we all wanted to be when we were young. I always wanted to be a pilot because I lived in the flight path of some of the counties air defences and the sky was always filled with massive transport planes or high-speed fighter jets.</p><p>This love was nurtured by my grandfather, who would ask me what planes I wanted to fly and where I would want to go. Asking questions about how I thought I would become I pilot and what training I would need. He used my innocent desire to open my eyes up to the things I needed to think about, and that has stuck with me.</p><p>So now when my son <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/james-morris/">says to me, he wants to be a YouTuber</a>, my reaction is “cool, how do you think you could do that” instead of the realistic (pessimistic) answer of “that’s not going to happen”. Indeed, the ship to making money on YouTube has not sailed, but it is harder than ever to get started and the level of work required is huge. It's important that he starts to think about this, <strong>but</strong> there’s no need to be boring just yet.</p>

     <p>Matt Birchler <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/migrating-from-wordpress/">is to blame</a> for some of the decisions I make in my tech and blogging life. Not because he does things differently, or tries to push his readers into things, but because he’s someone I look up too, and he speaks <em>mostly</em> a lot of sense. He’s been blogging for more than a decade (a milestone I won't pass until next year) and I am happy to say he is a good friend.</p><p>Matt has made a good name for himself in tech circles, and has done so by producing great content and plenty of it. His post from a few days ago about <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/absolutely-do-not-change-your-blogging-platform-unless-you-have-to/">not moving blogging platforms</a> is one of the reasons he’s been so successful. While I agree with his post wholeheartedly, there are a couple of things to dig into here to supplement it.</p><h2 id="permalinks">Permalinks</h2><p>The links to your posts should be treated like gold dust. They are the reason people read your stuff and find your blog in the first place. You should hold on to these as the most important piece of your blogging platform, and if you do, moving host will not matter in the slightest.</p><p>Your first job when setting up a blog <em>if</em> you make the hard choice to move platforms is to maintain the same structure as before or put a plan in place to redirect everything. With the first option being preferable. The links to your posts online are more valuable than what platform you use or how nice your posts look.</p><h2 id="let-down-by-providers">Let Down By Providers</h2><p>As I wrote in 2020, users <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/being-able-to-2/">should be able to move their blog</a> quickly and easily. Developers of these platforms are still letting down their users by not providing at least robust import options for all of their competition. This argument, granted, is idealistic and in many ways something that I never expect to see – but it still feels gross that barriers are in the way of you owning <em>your</em> content.</p><p>I can understand why companies put intentional barriers in the way to make moving more complicated, they want to keep your custom. However, the fact that platforms like <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> and <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> fall down at import options, is <strong>the</strong> reason you shouldn’t move about much. Not because your decisions are bad, not because your readers will care, but because you will waste too much time doing it for very little gain.</p><p><br />Of course, your readers <em>will</em> care if your permalinks break, or your RSS feed changes, but there are solutions for this. The biggest issue is that the time wasted moving and sorting issues out could be better spent blogging. Do that instead.</p>

     <p>One of the reasons I try not to write about my ways and opinions much any more is because of how peachy they can come across. When talking about anything, particularly something like technology usage, there’s a tendency to use instructional language that ends up being a post about little more than feeding the ego. My posts are never aimed like that, but I have read many that are, and whole books, that make me question my publication and motives.</p><p>Let’s take for example my repeated need every so often to <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/31/of-course-i.html">cut back my usage of Twitter</a>. This always leads to some kind of response coming back my way, either in direct reply but snarky subtweets. These kinds of responses <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/31/its-ok-to.html">do not bother me</a>, but they do reflect the way that social media tends to respond. I am told that the ‘personalness’ of social media leads to personal responses, but all we see are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-reply-guys">reply guys</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfE93xON8jk">Debbie Downers</a>.</p><p>People that take each interaction that is thrown into the ether as a slight on them and not merely a comment on the way that specific person feels. Using my Twitter example above, simply because I want to cut down my Twitter usage does not mean I am waving some kind of self-righteous flag and now looking down on people that continue to use it.</p><p>However, I get it. I’ve read the posts that <em>are</em> doing that. Lecturing you about the benefits of the thing they have done and imploring you to do the same. With all the ‘look how good I am’ ego pumping that their fingers can type. However, this is not the reason I publish things, it’s for me more than you. There is no preaching. Just a stream of consciousness and a written reference of my thoughts and feelings. Don’t take it personally.</p>

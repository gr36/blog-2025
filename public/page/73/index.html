<p>Feeling the need to defend Apple because another brand made an advert is a strange logic. Sure, the adverts are weird (no he’s not “just a normal guy”) but this really shouldn’t get the emotional response it has. A multi-trillion dollar company certainly does not need you to defend them. If anything the macBook speaks for itself in the market it is made for — which has very little cross over in the market this advert is aimed at.</p>
<p>Intel has been trying, and failing to become a brand in their own right for years. Remember the intel inside adverts? This new round of adverts are another attempt to do that, and <a href="https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/02.5-have-an-enemy">picking a fight</a> is the new way of doing business.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>The powers that be at Intel still want to be recognised as more than just the chip that’s stuffed into your laptop, and as other brands start to muscle in on their territory they need to lash out at a big company. Remember that no-one that buys a laptop at a lower price point than £1000 really gives a damn about new chips from Apple. They may see a macBook as an aspiration, but they don’t settle for an Intel laptop instead because they are compatible. They buy what they can afford, which is usually as cheep as possible, and be on their way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If anything their biggest comparison as connectivity improves are Chromebooks, but they can’t very well start lashing out at Samsung and Lenovo because they want to sell them chips for their other computers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, its logical that Intel would talk about Apple and at the same time big up all our business partners machines, it’s a win-win situation. Their chips will continue to be stuffed into the vast majority of computers sold and things will carry on as normal — like you should.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We know comparing MacBook to most laptops is Apple and Oranges, but who cares. It’s an advert…. Calm down.</p>

  Right now I am struggling with having positive thoughts. I want to get away from the eternal only fighting problems. I can’t. I can’t think of anything. Yes, I know… my family is healthy, I have a nice apartment and so on. There is enough. But that doesn’t distract me.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t know what it is recently but I feel exactly the same. Since January I’ve really struggled to get back to anywhere near myself.</p>
<p>I have found myself reacting poorly to stimulus, dwelling on negative thoughts and just not being my positive self. I feel a million miles away from where I was this time last year and there is no end in sight.</p>
<p>I know it’s perfectly fine to not be ok, but it’s hard to not share your negativity online.</p>

<div>
<p>For the past few days, I have been looking into the new notes app, Craft. It has been lauded up as the best app currently available, so understandably I wanted to take a proper look. I rage quite a couple of times previously because it was missing loads of things and wanted to charge £45 a year, but this time I went deep.</p>
<p>I posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1370683331562639361?s=20">long thread</a> about strange little bits that hadn’t been thought through properly. Including some weirdness with sharing vs exporting and poor implementation on Markdown. Perhaps the tendency to try to make it too powerful has lead to oversight in the ways it can actually be used. In an attempt to be more things to more people it feels more than a little lost.</p>
<p>It looks almost like an online Notion in places, and would allow me to store a lot of work related text files and PDF I have currently in folders easier, and allow them to be updated effortlessly. The exporting options in PDF and Word Doc look great and fulfils most of the things I often need to email to people — but I digress. The real root of this is thinking about UX rather than UI.</p>
<p>I can’t help but compare it to Notion in the fact that it too suffers from this slightly lost feeling. All the things have been thrown in, but thinking about actually using them takes more brain power than it actually should do. This is of course all my opinion. These things may have been thought about and decisions made that lean the other way from my usage. However, I am not alone in this feeling, reassured by several people on Twitter that they came to the same conclusion that leads me to believe that the UX need some serious attention.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>The last sentence of Jacks <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510769268850690?s=20">first tweet</a> in his thread when following Trumps banning from Twitter has stuck with me. While the whole world can wax lyrical about the context and argue back and cowards about the correctness of the action. It’s this last sentence that the man in charge really shows the type of leader he is.</p>
<p>It’s an important step in anyone’s journey through life. Realising that in many situations your point of view could be affected by a range of different things. More so when you interact with people, supervise interaction between people, or in Jacks case are in-charge of one of the largest, and fast-paced social networks in the world. Unfortunately, not everyone reaches this realisation at the same point in life, if at all.</p>
<p>There is also an overwhelming tendency for CEO’s and ‘Silicone Valley Types’ to let their egos run sit front and centre of their personality and take the high road at every opportunity. So, when someone openly discusses their reasoning behind the decision and even questions themselves it proves a welcome breath of fresh air and has been something that has resonated with me.</p>
<p>Questioning even what would appear a pretty simple decision proves overwhelmingly that nothing is ever that simple. From everything from product managers, to parents it’s important to think about not only the decisions you make, but help others understand how you got there and be open for dialogue. You may think, or know you ar making the right decision but even the right choices can be interpreted differently by others.</p>
<p>There are an abundance of view points that it is impossible for anyone to consider, sure enough you don’t owe anyone an explanation at all. However, baring in mind how your decision can be perceived by others can mean to more understanding and more constructive feedback. It also might help you understand the designs you make more in-depth and lead to you being able to identify miss steps in your own though patterns early.</p>
<p>When you think about Jacker leadership of twitter, and the apparent lack of action over the platforms the biggest issues his response makes perfect sense. The lack of action could be put down to over thinking and miss steps in management. When in fact his thread shows the level of thought that goes behind decisions that can bring in gigantic changes to a platform hundreds of millions of people use.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It doesn’t exist. You can’t find everything you want from an app, it’s like finding a unicorn. You’re going to have to compromise in some areas to get something you’re happy with. These are all things I have heard said, or have been said to me when I have been looking for the perfect app previously. It doesn’t matter if it is a todo app, calendar app, or note-taking companion — the perfect thing just doesn’t seem to exist. Doesn’t stop me from looking though!</p>
<p>I’ve been on a <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/03/searching-for-the-perfect-ios-markdown-writing-tool/">Jason Snell’esk</a> search for a writing app, or service that can do everything that I need it to do. I started by outlining exactly what I needed and the ways I would attempt to rank the ability for this to be fulfilled. I needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing app that was accessible and nice to write in. My eyesight is not what it was, so I sometimes like to boost the font size when in ‘focus mode’.</li>
<li>Able to take quick notes</li>
<li>Supports markdown. This can be either plain text or a modified version that hides some syntax, the important part is I can type it out because that’s just how my fingers work across a keyboard.</li>
<li>Able to export as a PDF and Word document. I use these lots for storing documents for work use, and sending these out for approval. Word is what my bosses prefer to use.</li>
<li>Works well across iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bear-notes">Bear Notes</h2>
<p>This is an app <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-keep-coming/">I keep coming back to</a>. I tested the beta versions, and have been testing the upcoming new version extensively on both Mac and iOS. The ‘notes’ app is amazingly powerful, so much so I wouldn’t consider it a notes app at all as it can go toe to toe with much larger and expensive apps.</p>
<p>It looks great, incorporates the best iOS features such as shortcuts and widgets, and I can export all notes in a rage of formats including text bundle that I can <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/bear-notes-app/">publish straight to WordPress</a>.</p>
<p>However, I don’t love the tagging a system of organisation. I much prefer an inbox that I can sort and file things away. Where’s as by adding hashtags it gets some resemblance of order to it but still feels a little too chaotic with loads of notes.</p>
<p>The exporting also lacks any level of customisation, and some styling of these takes a bit of editing before I can send.</p>

<h2 id="craft">Craft</h2>
<p>The new hotness in iOS text apps nudges in here simply because of how powerful it is. Not an app I would usually consider due to its strange way of doing things (I talk about this more in my newsletter) and it’s expense.</p>
<p>With that said, Craft allows me to store almost every bit of text I could ever need from a simple note to writing a book if I ever needed too, all whilst looking brilliant and offering powerful export features.</p>
<p>A massive positive is the organisation Craft uses, based on folders and areas, works more like my brain does. Meaning I can have an inbox full of ideas, work on writing posts, store information for my day job and be able to edit and export to email effortlessly.</p>
<p>But… I just can’t get on board with some decision made with the app. Markdown is half-baked at best. For example, I cannot type in the image reference for an external image, it just disappears. Craft only support some Markdown syntax and not all of it, and there is also lots of UX weirdness I can’t wrap my head around.</p>

<h2 id="ulysses">Ulysses</h2>
<p>My favourite writing app for many years and one that I only recently stopped using because I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-didnt-want/">moved away from Ghost</a>. At the time I felt it was one of those apps I paid for simply because I always had, and it felt over engineered for my usage. Built more for real writers rather than bloggers.</p>
<p>It supports loads of iOS features such as shortcuts, allow me to store documents in folders and offers me a useful inbox. Ulysses is also fantastic at exporting in a range of different options and even allows for custom styling of them.</p>
<p>My only downfall really is that it doesn’t work very well as a note-taking app, or at least it doesn’t feel like it does. Starting can sometimes be a bit slow, so I would potentially have to use Apple notes for smaller things which is no hardship.</p>
<h2 id="back-home">Back Home</h2>
<p>Like some kind of cheating husband I have gone all around the houses only to realise the one <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1372593179501985794?s=20">I recently left is the best fit for me</a>. There are a few things I’d love to see improved but in terms of ticking away at all the points above Ulysses fits me like a glove. When throwing my hands up in the air and re-downloading it the first launch just felt like home. As much as all these flashy new apps come on the scene, or I just start looking for no good reason, the tried and tested option is quite often the best.</p>
<hr />
<p>Special mention to:</p>
<p>iA Writer — I love the interface, but I don’t really want to mess around with a folder full of files.</p>
<p>Byword — the same as above really, I used to love this app, but it feels left behind.</p>
<p>Apple notes — too much weirdness in pasting in information, particularly links. For some strange reason it still doesn’t support CMD+K on iOS.</p>
<p>I am sure there are plenty of others out there I didn’t try, please don’t tell me then, just let me live in blissful ignorance!</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Andy <a href="https://world.hey.com/andyn/the-sound-of-silence-5883fc39">on his avoidance of silence</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
I had a brief moment of silence today, only about a minute, but the feeling I had was so jarring, so alien to me, it actually felt like it would be interesting to write about. It probably made more sense at the time
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is something I have had on my mind for, <a href="/2019/04/29/skipping-silence.html">well years</a>. I think silence is an important part of life and communication. I value the time that is spent in silence and only break it when there is something important to break it.</p>
<p>I completely understand where Andy is coming from though. Many people find silence uncomfortable and something that will expend a significant amount of energy to avoid. I can’t comment on the reasons behind this side everyone, but previously it was because I felt uncomfortable with my own thoughts and wanted to be entertained constantly.</p>
<p>I didn’t really know myself and as such there were a lot of feelings and experiences I had had that I just didn’t want to risk thinking about. When it’s so easy to gain stimulation from external sources there is little reason to look into yourself at any point. Enjoying silence is one thing. It becoming comfortable in it is a life skill that everyone should learn early on.</p>
<p>I have been trying, and failing, to get my son into the habit of embracing boredom and silence in order to better himself. He’s 9 though so I don’t expect too much — but I really wish someone had explained these things to me at that age. Thinking and sitting with nothing particular to do needs work though, and work is hard!</p>
<blockquote><p>
Thinking, existentially speaking, is a solitary but not a lonely business; solitude is that human situation in which I keep myself company. Loneliness comes about … when I am one and without company’ but desire it and cannot find it. – Arendt
</p></blockquote>
<p>One you know this skill, practice it and become comfortable with it, you realise what a powerful tool it is to improve the times when you are not silent. You become more appreciative of the communication in your life and able to focus more than ever.</p>

<p>My eyes rolled so hard that I got a bit dizzy from the stupidness of this statement. Blogging has absolutely nothing to do with follows or likes so promising to fix two things that are not an issue when publishing a post on a blog is weird.</p>
<p>Sharing it to social media and getting views, maybe. But that has nothing to do with where or how you publish to your blog.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  It is worth noting that Apple’s app privacy labels are meant to show all the things that the app might access, not what information that app will access. For example, an app may only use location data when it needs to show you a map, but the privacy labels don’t make that clear — it’s just a binary used/not used. Also, the information in the labels is submitted by the company itself, and Apple doesn’t make promises about its accuracy.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems that the privacy labels that Apple show are more than a little bit fuzzy. Whilst it’s easy to start to point fingers, there are lots and lots of moving parts in anything to do with apps, income and huge businesses. It can’t be easy to implement these kinds of privacy options, but it seems they are not over looked by Apple.</p>
<p>Much like the permissions systems, there is a lot to communicate to the customer exactly why the app needs certain types of data. Whilst you want to display this clearly, you don’t want to put people off entirely for risk of loosing business.</p>
<p>I’m still <a href="https://gr36.com/apple-privacy-not-enough/">disappointed that these don’t go far enough</a>, but it least we are on the right track.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I want to try and keep a post or page updated with the tools I am using and apps I have installed. I gain so much insight into the ways others use their devices from <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/9126-2/">these types of posts</a> so it’s only fair I do the same.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/ce15871515.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Very little <a href="https://gr36.com/homescreen-january-2021/">ever changes about my phone</a> but the <a href="https://gr36.com/favourite-ios-apps/">apps sometimes revolve around</a>. At different times of the year different apps become more important. So new ones appear on my single homescreen and some drop off.</p>
<p>The apps I need access to can be split into four basic categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio – Podcasts have become a lot less important since COVID due to no commuting. I still listen to the occasional show whilst walking in Pocketcasts, but I’ve been consuming more audio books lately. </li>
<li>Reading – I <a href="https://gr36.com/my-reading-flow/">love reading</a> and my iPhone is one of the devices I use most as it’s always on me. Instead of <a href="https://gr36.com/twitter-muscle-memory/">scrolling Twitter</a> I now open up <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/reeder-5/id1529445840">Reeder</a> or Pocket and catch up on things.</li>
<li>Photos – I like to keep the camera and gallery app near by, at least until the <a href="https://gr36.com/the-iphone-needs-a-camera-button/">iPhone gets a camera button</a>!</li>
<li>Writing – everything goes in <a href="https://gr36.com/back-to-bear/">Bear</a> now. I’m slowly migrating away from using <a href="https://gr36.com/my-writing-workflow/">Roam</a> after falling out of love with it and wanting to spend less on digital services. It’s a great platform but it’s getting a bit lost and no proper app doesn’t help. </li>
</ul>
<p>I also have micro.blog as my main social media fix. I also find a lot to read here, as well as awesome photos. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wavelength-for-micro-blog/id1365158696">Wavelength</a> is something I am thinking of using to start a small podcast.</p>
<h2>Widgets</h2>
<p>I mainly use Reminders to store things I need to do. However I am looking at bringing back something more robust for projects — hence Todoist and Things installed currently.</p>
<p>The larger Headspace widget helps me remember to use it more often. I love meditation and it’s part of my <a href="https://gr36.com/2020-review/">2021 improvements</a> to do it more often. The rest are self explainatory, <a href="/categories/shortcuts/">Shortcuts</a> are always around here somewhere.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Mario Villalobos <a href="https://mariovillalobos.com/2021/03/10/am.html">on when to say yes</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  There’s this mindset among many people online that I like to call app lust. It means this desire to try out the next great app because people think it’ll be the answer to their problems but in reality just serves as a distraction that gives the person a hit of dopamine. Each new app satisfies this craving, and they’re always on the lookout for the next hit. I used to be this way, and I’ve learned that I’m happier when I rely less on technology and on apps.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been thinking <a href="/2019/07/29/a-new-productivity.html">about this for a long time</a>. Gabs <a href="/2021/03/09/no-replacement-for.html">touched on it</a> a few days ago, but Mario has put it perfectly. The level of consumerism and marketing tricks being used to sell apps and services is growing over time. They all promise to fix that gap in your work life, just like adverts promise to fix the one in your love life, or improve your happiness, or whatever it is. It’s all lies.</p>
<p>You see the same YouTubers and podcasters just <em>happen</em> to be talking about the same app at the same time. Flooding the market with overwhelming praise for this new thing that’s just the price of a coffee each month and will make you do sooooo much more work.</p>
<p>Spending time moving to a new service just because someone said so is costing you time and money. Stop it. You’re just craving the same dopamine hit consumerism sells you.</p>
<p>There is no answer to your problems unless you’ve used your current method to exhaustion or sorted your system out. Perhaps your current <a href="/2021/03/10/when-are-you.html">one is enough</a>?</p>

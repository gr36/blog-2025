<p>One of the great things about writing about how you feel is having to first understand what you <em>do</em> actually feel. Understanding what is going on inside your own mind and who you actually are is one of the hardest things because so often all of these feelings and motivations are on a non verbal level. Very often it isn’t until I see the self expression of someone else I realise I feel like that too, but never knew how to communicate it.</p>
<p>This is one of the huge problems with living in a world of algorithms and curated feeds of information. The AI used to find tune each and everything we see now understands us — the real us, the internal us — far better than we can ever hope to. It understand us and what we need to see to get the best possible result. Surrounding us in a bubble of our own feelings reflected back at us by others.</p>
<p>So when we step out of this haze and interact with people that don’t think and react like we do, it’s a shock to the system. Our self centred nature allows us to completely ignore the feelings of people around us because we are so internally focused on ourselves that we don’t understand any other way. It takes effort to understand the way others think and the reasons behind the way they react.</p>
<p>Too much effort for us to bother with. So we close ourself off in our own curated world, attempt to cancel anything we don’t like and carry on. Why resist. Being surrounded by an environment that understand us, breeds our thoughts and shapes our desires in their own image makes us content. Why bother to understand anyone else not like us. We are happy in this state, but we are not living.</p>

     <p>Before starting anything I do, no matter how small I find it important to think about what success in this task looks like. Some things are very simple, you don’t need to comprehend the end result of taking your rubbish out, but the benefit of thinking about the desired outcome for all of your tasks proves very beneficial.</p><p>Success is completely different for different people, and dependant on what the task at hand is. For many of the things I do on a daily basis it is producing something physical. Something I can hold in my hand or look at on a screen and be happy with. So success for me in these task is producing something that fulfils, or exceeds, the vision I had for it when I started. Taking an idea and forming a blog post about it is pretty easy, my success is producing something I can hit publish on.</p><p>I do not measure my success on the amount of views, likes or whatever metrics surround it. However it <em>is</em> important to consider this in other situations. So what does success look like to you? When do you consider this before starting a task? Try thinking about it before diving in, not afterwards, and you will see just how successful you <em>really</em> are.</p>

<p>Above is a screenshot of my second brain. Taken from the compact graph view of <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> showing all of the things I have typed into it in the last few months and their connections to each other. I have fallen off a little recently and being lax in typing out my morning pages and keeping track of everything (see point above about habits) but this is truly one of the best platforms I have ever become invested in.</p>
<p>It contains all of my meeting notes, all of my to-do lists, all of my morning pages as well as everything else you would use a note app for. Combine this with <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise</a>, and it is starting to truly be my second brain and helping me retain more important stuff than ever. I have around 200 book and article notes stored in Roam, and the platform forms relationships between them without me doing anything, surfacing information to me at various points in the day to aid my life.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if I am writing meeting notes, or a blog post, I can easily research any topics and Roam will give me prompts when I have covered the same things before even if I have not linked them together before. Leading to me to retain much less things in my brain and allowing me to concentrate on what is really important. So referring to Roam as a note taking app, and sneering at the price is redundant to me and many others that find the value that it provides priceless.</p>

<p>Listen. My iPhone 12 Pro review is about 3 weeks late at this point and may never see the light of day unless I pull my finger out. The words I have been trying to write abut this phone have been some of the hardest I have ever produced. Not because the iPhone 12 Pro isn’t good, it’s great, but because it doesn’t spark anything in me.</p>
<p>If you’ve used an iPhone in the last, well ever, you know what you’re getting and this new model is no different. In years gone by this would just be the new iPhone. Everyone would buy it and then be on their merry way to another year of iPhone use. But now, Apple produced a full-line up of iPhones and this year the iPhone 12 Pro sits <em>in the middle</em> and confuses pretty much everything.</p>
<p>So, when I set my hands on the iPhone 12 Mini it sparked something in me that I have not felt for a while. It was the same old iOS device I love, but it was different for a change. A truly modern smartphone in a small package (something like the iPhone 5s style) with pretty much nothing taken away.</p>
<p>This phone wins for me. I bought all three sizes this year and this by far is my favourite to use. I have returned all the others but kept this little bundle of joy. Half the time I don’t know where I have put my phone now, and that is the reason I love it so much.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>One question has been stuck in my brain for the last week or so. One that was not flippantly asked, but asked with conviction and pursuing a real answer. <a href="https://twitter.com/zcichy">Zac Cichy</a> pressed his <a href="https://www.projecthuman.fm/show/2-rene-ritchie">guest Rene Richie</a> to see if people at Apple actually think about the changes that their products and services <em>actually</em> make to not only their users, but also society at large.</p>
<p>This sounds like an obvious question, and one that was answered quite honestly by Rene, being that Steve Jobs and to a certain point many people at Apple, have a more positive view point when talking about their products or advancements in technology. With a natural blind spot to all the bad things that these can also cause. For every boost in communication and productivity gain you get a Facebook and Google (his choice of companies not mine, although I would agree with them).</p>
<blockquote><p>This invention has the power to drastically alter the nature of human existence. I think it could help humanity. But it could also make things even worse. — Ready Player Two</p></blockquote>
<p>We trust the brands we invest in, with both our money and our attention, to have the best interests of their users in mind when producing their products. Which in the vast majority of cases is well-founded. However, there are companies where it is more obvious their intentions are more nefarious.</p>
<p>In Steven Levy book “<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B081R296DR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o04">Facebook: The Inside Story</a>” he goes into great detail, whilst being led by several people that are familiar with the matter, on Facebooks problems and therefore its users problems. Brought about by its relentless pursuit of growth at all costs. “Chasing growth that hadn’t happened naturally, attempting to crush competitors” and a leader hell-bent on becoming everything that Facebook wasn’t.</p>
<p>One “unintended consequence” after another proves that not all people think about this stuff, or instead are so shortsighted that it doesn’t even register. Undoubtedly, this happens in every single company on the face of the planet at some stage or another. With every great stride forward comes another towards a future of more technology ingress into our lives, something that can be amazingly positive but also end life as we know it!</p>
<p>I hope to god people think about this stuff, but I have my doubts, and if they do I don’t think they do it hard enough.</p>

<p>The artificial manipulation to change our wants and spending stems from our internal desire to create the perfect holiday experience with magical memories for our family and kids. Shopping promised to meet that need, but only detracts from it.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>As much as I would love to peach about minimalism some more, the best thing to others that don’t subscribe to to the same view point is to try and remind others about the manipulation involved.</p>
<p>Shopping is such a minefield I only managed to make sense of it once I took a step back and saw it for what it was. Companies trying to make more money in the endless pursuit of growth. Something that is understandable, manipulative but also something you don’t have to subscribe to.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I am a few days away from deciding on which iPhone 12 size to go for and it’s making me think deeper about myself than I am comfortable with. It’s a ridiculous issue to have, but it’s one that I have, so here we are.</p>
<p>For the last few years I have bought the new iPhone released no questions asked. iPhone 5s, 6, 6s plus, 7, X, XS Max and 11 pro. I chose each phone with little hesitation and carried on my merry way without a second thought. Something changed halfway through my time with the 11pro and I realised just how little I was using my £1000 smartphone, so I sold it and used an iPhone SE until the iPhone 12 launch.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Well, this just gives you backstory because this year the line up brings me so much indecision that I ordered three phones! Which is great and all but I now can’t decide which one to use.</p>
<p>There is enough between them to make the choice important, but this issue speaks about my current situation more than it does about the phones themselves. In a pandemic and working from home perhaps dictates a different choice in technology, and whilst I felt the Pixel 5 was made in a pandemic I think the iPhone 12 range is made for a very different work to the one we have now.</p>
<h2>Which User Am I?</h2>
<p>The iPhone 12 mini is the phone I want to be a user of. It’s small, light and fills me with minimalistic dreams that I can’t ignore. It’s everything I want from a smartphone, and most of all it leaves much less a mark on my life than the others do.</p>
<p>The iPhone 12 Pro is my default. It’s boring, unassuming but very able to do pretty much everything. It’s the compromise phone and consumes enough of the others in the line ability to potentially be <a href="https://twitter.com/gr36/status/1329829511341469700?s=21">my Goldilocks phone</a>.</p>
<p>The iPhone 12 Pro Max is me giving into my desires and getting what I really want. It caters to my narcissistic urges, is the most powerful and unapologetically massive. You can’t use it one handed very well but it does what it does best and gives you arguably the best media experience. It’s fulfilling my fear of missing out and does more than everything else.</p>
<p>There’s a huge difference between getting what I want and what I need. The iPhone 12 Pro Max is great in some situations but due to its size feels a little like wearing skis all year because you go in the winter. Whereas I know which phone I should use, to remove it as much from my life as possible.</p>
<p>These issues are all internal, and I am aware of this entirely. It’s a stupid issue to have, but I think about it nonetheless. Which one I choose my speak more about myself than actually about the phone.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>After touching on the subject in <a href="https://gr36.com/gtt/gtt-18/">last weeks newsletter</a>, I am inspired by Matt Birchler (once again) to push into <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/my-productivity-goals-for-the-week/">finding free apps to replace subscriptions</a>. His new productivity goals have this pegged as number one and I think it’s really important to think about doing the same.</p>
<p>Monthly or yearly subscriptions are great, they support development of apps a services and make sure they receive the money that they deserve. There are more than few I could not live without, <a href="https://gr36.com/one-year-of-the-ipad-pro-as-my-computer/">Ulysses</a> and <a href="https://gr36.com/favourite-hey-features/">Hey</a> to name two of my favourite. However it is really easy to get carried away and just pony up for an app that offers little value or simply because everyone else uses it.</p>
<p>I am a huge believer it not relying on <a href="https://gr36.com/a-new-productivity-app-wont-make-you-more-productive/">yet another app to make you more productive</a>, you will simply spend more time moving and learning the app than getting things done, and use it as an excuse to procrastinate more. As Matt says in his post “Saving money and reminding myself another tool will not solve my problems” is the right approach to take.</p>
<p>I have recently moved back to using many stock apps instead of renewing subscriptions and in times like these it has saved me quite a bit of money. It also improves internal motivation to get things done, it is <em>me</em> that can get things done not the app. Use whatever it is you have to hand, a pen and paper are often the best tools to use and it might even help you detach from your smartphone or computer for a little while.</p>
<p>I’d love to know more free alternatives <em>you</em> have been using to help you get things done. It doesn’t have to be a task manager or email app. What is a job you used to get done by paying money and have now found a system that is free (or next to free)? <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=hey%20%40gr36%20check%20this%20out%20">Get in touch</a>, because I would love to share tips and tricks to others that could benefit from new ideas.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve been delving into origin stories of some of my sons favourite superhero’s and it got me thinking about mine. You might think I have been around here for ages. Bleating on about Apple news like some kind of village idiot and generally writing things no one reads. However, my Apple usage has been a relatively short one, and started at random points during the last 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone</strong></p>
<p>I came to the iPhone really early in its life but was gone quickly. I managed to convince my mum to get me an iPhone 3G on a ridiculously expensive monthly contract about 2 weeks after it came out. At the time I had a Nokia N73 and touchscreen phones were the way to go, but nothing came close to the iPhone.</p>
<p>After this brief time with a 3G I left and never looked back. Then began a long stream of Android phones that when I look at now, although fun to use, never lived up to an iPhone. The problem was, iPhones were much more expensive and exclusive to one network, which meant they were impossible to consider for quite a while.</p>
<p>I resisted is as long as I could but came back again to the iPhone 5s. It was the first iPhone for a while reviewers were raving about and I was looking for something to work with my iPad. Couple this and my blossoming love for the iMac meant that an iPhone just made sense.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/69456a8f5b.jpg" alt="MagSafe Wallet iPhoen 12 Pro Max 1 1" title="MagSafe-Wallet-iPhoen-12-Pro-Max-1-1.jpg" border="0" width="1000" height="563" /><strong>iPad</strong></p>
<p>When the iPad first came out I wanted one, but couldn’t get hold of one anywhere. It was months later before I got my hands on one as a Christmas present. I liked the idea of being able to play games with my kids on it and Lucie loved swiping around on the screen. This felt like the future to me, but it stayed very much a consumption device and the initial excitement faded into the background.</p>
<p>At the time I was hardcore into Android and had a long stream of new tablets to try out through my day job. I then didn’t pick up an iPad again until I moved into a new career and was handed an iPad Air as my main device. I didn’t really know what to do with it, but had to complete site visit reports on it so it also became my Laptop.</p>
<p>I poured over <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-2-review-why-the-ipad-became-my-main-computer/">guides from MacStories</a>, downloaded editorial guides and a year or so later began to lose hours of my life to the new hot thing that was Workflow. I bought a Logitech keyboard cases to go with it and never used anything else other than my iPad when I wasn’t sat at a desk. It became my computer a long time before Apple started marketing it as one, and before it came the new hotness to brag about on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>
<p>I began using a MacBook alongside an Android phone simply because Windows PCs became unappealing to me. When looking for a new laptop in a local electronics store I was encouraged to have a look at a MacBook. I am sure this was to try and upsell me something, but I was unimpressed with Windows 8 and really didn’t want to mess around with it any longer.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks I did some research and settled on a used MacBook Pro. I bought this through Facebook, and picked it up the next day. I have no idea what model it was but it was in incredible shape and did me proud. A few months later I picked up a new MacBook Air for a steal as it was being replaced by a new version. This was the old non-retina version and although great it didn’t quite live up to my old MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>About six months later I picked up a New MacBook Pro Retina on Boxing Day sales and my life with a Mac continued ever since. When I began podcasting a lot I picked up a second hand iMac from the head of our IT department and only upgraded this last year to an iMac Pro.</p>
<p>My journey into the Apple ecosystem has been a long one but an interesting one. The reverse of many other stories I have heard, as most then to start with an iPhone and go from there. I have considered trying to <a href="https://gr36.com/considering-jumping-the-walls/">jumping the walls</a> a few times in the past, but never manage it. The Apple Echo system just suits me, and its simply where I feel most at home.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>About 10 months ago, I was invited down by Samsung KX to have a few hours hands on with their first folding phone. Mere months after it had been recalled due to major issues with the device, it was back with a bang, and already picking up quite a following. The appeal of having a tablet folded up in your pocket had a much larger pull than the £1500 price tag, as was <a href="https://gr36.com/advance-tech-exciting/">the exciting move forward in technology</a> that Samsung had been teasing for years.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1mVtJ4oVhQ&feature=emb_title">really liking the phone</a>, it wasn’t ready for me to splash my own cash on it, there were far too many compromises with handset for me to bear. Fast-forward to now as the second version goes on sale, with many of the first versions issues fixed — but with a hefty price increase. Has Samsung done enough to justify the £1800 ($2000) price tag?</p>
<h2>Premium Feel</h2>
<p>There are lots of people that get annoyed when you talk about the price of the Galaxy Z Fold 2 in reviews. They think that this shouldn’t be brought into it as there is nothing that lives up to the Folds usability. While this true, it is impossible to escape the £1800 price tag and the expectations it brings with it. You expect a premium smartphone with top of the line specs — and that is exactly what you get from the handset. In the hand it feels nothing short of magical, the weight (282g) is impossible to describe as anything else but heavy, but in the hand it is balanced perfectly.</p>
<p>Especially folded, the unit sinks into your hand with a reassuring heft. Samsung have done some great engineering to get all the technology in this size package, but you feel the weight every time you use it. There are no creaks or cracks from this Uber Smartphone, so the engineering needs some special appreciation when compared to others on the market.</p>
<p>Samsung have developed the hinge much further forward when compared to last years unit, and taken over much of the function from <a href="https://gr36.com/48-hours-galaxy-z-flip/">the Z Flip</a>. Four CAM hinges allow the phone to be oped to whichever angle you wish, and provides more resistance to opening to allow more usability. Combined with a sweeper system to remove dust from the hinge should mean that this unit resists the issues plaguing the first attempt, and certainly those still using the Z Flip support this claim.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/86727f19a4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="337" /></p>
<p>This re-engineered hinge further adds to the premium feel for the Galaxy Z Fold 2, where every part of the hardware feels thought through and designed to exude a certain type of extravagant image. As <a href="https://youtu.be/fQ3ReOb85ac?t=589">Flossy Carter says</a>, you are going to see lots of images of these on tables surrounded by glasses of Cristal. There is a certain exuberance to the Galaxy Fold 2, and lots of flexing going on simply because it delivers on it premium price tag.</p>
<h2>Screens</h2>
<p>Perhaps the number one complaint against the first version of the Galaxy Fold was the tiny cover screen. While perfectly useful for notification triaging, on a device so futuristic it felt out of place. So, understandably this is the first thing that is immediately obvious when using the Fold 2. The cover screen now fills almost the entirety of the front of the phone minus a small hole punch camera cut out.</p>
<p>At 6.2” (2260×816 – 386ppi – 60hz ) the cover screen is now more usable, and even if a bit narrow to type on, is perfect for quick tasks or responding to notifications. Enabling swiping on the keyboard makes interacting with the keyboard at bit easier, but this is not to say it is impossible. The tall, narrow screen is perfectly suited to scrolling through emails or social media. Using the cover screen grows on you more than the last version ever did, and I found myself interacting with it much more than I thought I would.</p>
<p><img title="Z-Fold-2-Review-06-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d7fab7f4ad.jpg" alt="Z Fold 2 Review 06 1" width="450" height="600" border="0" /></p>
<p>However, why have a huge screen and not use it, open up the fold and the beauty of the screen is a wonder to behold. Samsung have done away with the huge notch from the first version as well as boosting the size and refresh rate (2208×1768 – 373ppi – 120hz). Dubbed the ‘Infinity Flex’ display, it goes closer to the edge now, encompassing the whole of the device, bar Samsungs signature hold punch.</p>
<p>Apps in use on the cover screen carry over to the inside screen (bar a little bit of weirdness from some), to give you something truly immersive. When using the inner screen it feels like you are moving pixels around the screen. The adaptive display varies refresh rate from 11zh all the way up to 120hz, meaning that no matter that you are doing you will get great battery life and also a smooth scrolling experience. The Jelly scroll that the original fold suffered from is not completely removed but almost impossible to spot.</p>
<p>It’s hard to find a downside to this gorgeous display, games look great, reading is brilliant and videos immersive. When open the device feels balanced and perfectly poised in your hand for media consumption, and many users will see little reason to use anything else for all of their needs. The inner display is truly why you would buy the Galaxy fold, and this version truly delivers.</p>
<p>Of course there is one, the screen has a crease in the middle that is hard to avoid. Much like any other foldable, you can feel it in usage, you can see it in some instances but not every one. The great thing is that it does not take away anything when you are using the device, it doesn’t stick out and in fact soon fades into the background like a notched screen, or the camera hole punch.</p>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>So, you want to actually use the thing right? Well all of that reassuring weight we have spoken about, it’s also going to affect it in your pocket and in your hand. There is no getting away from this phone/tablet hybrid being heavy. I found myself struggling to hold it up when open, and resorted to using both hands most of the time — but that’s the point right.</p>
<p>In this heavy package you get two screens, and battery life that will get you loads of screen onetime if you use the larger screen most of the time — and considerably more if you use the outer screen more. Even in the first week of me using the Fold 2 and playing with it what felt like constantly, I would still be at more than 25% when going to bed. You should comfortably be able to get 6hours of screen on time and still have battery left over, which is amazing results considering battery life should also get better as the OS analyses my usage and improves things. If the next model slims things down, I would hope that battery life stays as good as it is because an increase in weight is worth it.</p>
<p>You can’t expect a Galaxy fold to be as light as a regular phone can you, this is simply the trade off with wanting and using one of these devices. While something like the Z flip balances the reassuring weight without feeling clumsy, the Z Fold feels a little unwieldy when out and about. Bending the phone slightly helps to fit it better in your hand, but obviously adds a little distortion to the screen.</p>
<p><img title="Z-Fold-2-Review-08-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ce633d6733.jpg" alt="Z Fold 2 Review 08 1" /></p>
<h3>Flex Mode</h3>
<p>Expanding on the special mode introduced with the Z Flip, the Z Fold 2 allows apps to take advantage of a partially folded state. As an example Youtube in Flex mode shows a video on the top half of the screen, allowing you to interact with the comments on the bottom half. Google Duo also supports this as does the native camera app.</p>
<p>The limited nature of this and the lack of visual clues means you may spend a bit of time experimenting to find out what does and doesn’t support it — and often this is more no than yes. I am yet to find any reason to use it outside of novelty, especially given the lack of people actually using Google Duo. I wouldn’t go out of my way to encourage others to use it, just so I can flex my phone.</p>
<p>More often that not, a partial flexed form is used simply to enable me to set my phone down and still watch a video, or prop it up to keep an eye on the time. As app developers update apps we <em>might</em> see some more innovative use of flex mode, but given the lack of support so far I wouldn’t hold my breath.</p>
<h3>Tablet Mode</h3>
<p>Which leads me into another issue with app support, and the lack of tablet layout from apps. It could be the weird aspect ratio, it could be Android apps as a whole, but many apps make little use of the bigger screen.</p>
<p>Apps like Outlook are a delight to use, and offer different layouts and view options, but most just put more content on the screen with no options to increase text size or improve readability. Samsung does offers options in settings to choose between blowing the app up or trying to force more content. Combined with further options in Samsungs own <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock-2020">Goodlock app</a>, you can tune most things to work, but it takes a considerable amount of work.</p>
<h3>Muti-Tasking Master</h3>
<p>All these words can be ignored if you want the biggest screen possible on a smartphone to do your ‘stuff’. If you need a device to work on the go, consume loads of media, or just want to blow everything up as large as possible you’ll put up with all the downsides.</p>
<p>Samsung have put in a great deal of work to make the Fold 2 take advantage of the large inner screen and make it as useful as possible. It is a delight to use two apps side by side when multi taking. Having email and calendar up on the screen while talking on the phone, or simply watching YouTube while texting is quite frankly a transformative experience. Sure you can do that on a tablet, but you can’t then fold it up and put it in your pocket. If being productive on the go is your bag, then this needs to be your phone.</p>
<p>I am on the fence about how usable Flex mode is, but the amazing app pairing done by OneUI is something that you may struggle to live without. Other phones such as the Note20 Ultra do this as well, but nowhere near on the same level.</p>
<p><img title="Z-Fold-2-Review-05-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5e6851d313.jpg" alt="Z Fold 2 Review 05 1" /></p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 2 runs on Android 10 and has Samsungs One UI 2.5 on top of this to add in additional features. It comes bundled with the expected Google services but also several Microsoft ones baked in, such as syncing your photos to OneDrive. There is very little to say about Android nowadays, as it functions exactly as expected and is intuitive to use. The tie with Microsoft is due to get stronger with improvements to note and reminders syncing with MS products as they take aim at productivity customers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for Samsung, they seem to never really get services 100% correct. Photo sync only works with a Microsoft account, not a Microsoft 365 account which is frankly bizarre. A Microsoft 365 calendar does not sync to the stock calendar unless you instal the Samsung email app, yet you are encouraged to use Outlook.</p>
<p>Samsung does provide, in my opinion, the best extension or ‘skin’ on Android around today. Samsung’s design and user experience are often a delight to use. They have really thought about a modern design that doesn’t deviate too far from stock Android design, but offers something uniquely Samsung. Of course that is a subject view point, but since OneUI was introduced the design and implementation of their software has improved dramatically.</p>
<p>I just wish Samsung didn’t feel the need to fill their apps full of adverts, or useless information at every turn. Even the default weather app has news articles and rubbish crammed in it for no good reason. I know it takes very little to change these apps to others, I just don’t expect to see these kinds of things in default apps on an £1800 phone. Some users have already reported adverts and the usual shady tactics by Samsung, something that needs to be fixed if they want to be taken seriously.</p>
<h3>Changes to your life</h3>
<p>When you adopt the Fold 2 it changes the way you use your phone. Both in a positive and a negative way. The large screen allows you to do things that you simply can’t any other phone, it provides something that only the Z Fold can provide. It is in essence a folding tablet, and there are adjustments you will have to make to the way you use it.</p>
<p>Taking out the Fold 2 and walking around gives you a level of anxiety that nothing else has given me. The slippery body and high price tag make me nervous every time my phone makes a noise. There are already reports of some dropages, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/iuwzkj/welp/">it seems to hold up pretty well</a>, but the lack of cases and expected large repair bills leave me worried, and I am not the only one. Due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/16/21139897/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-ultra-thin-glass-durability-scratch-test-jerryrigeverything">longevity worries on the UTG screen</a> and no IP rating, users are worried <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/iw71es/im_scared_to_clean_the_inner_screen_protector/">even about cleaning the device correctly</a>.</p>
<p>The inner screen still has a tendency to scratch easily, and you’ll need to take some extra care. You won’t be using this at the beach, or throwing it into the bottom of a bag, but if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-Gt4GpEgyU">long-time users of other foldable phones</a> are anything to go by it should hold up ok. It is just another thing you need to think about when choosing a device like this.</p>
<p>I have to treat this phone with an extra amount of care, and in some instances change the way I use it. Which is what a foldable device dictates, you are carrying around a huge screen in your pocket and as such you’ll be opening it as much as possible to really take advantage. The screen draws you in and makes many tasks much easier, such as typing out a long email on the split keyboard.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>If there is anything I can point the finger at that is simply not good enough it is the camera. There is nothing inherently wrong with the shooter, but at this super flagship price point it is simply not good enough.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> get some good shots from it, but be prepared to work for them and chuck 30–40% of them in the bin. In good light you are going to be happy with almost everything you take, despite not holding the most amount of detail they could, shots are bright and as with all Samsung images retain a vibrant saturation. In any other situation they are grainy, washed out and suffer from some kind of strange skin smoothing effort despite the option being switched off.</p>
<p>When trying to discus this with others that have the phone you are told to use Pro mode and do this and that, or simply blamed for the results. While it great that these options exist for you to have control over the image you take, I don’t feel you should <em>have</em> to do this is take a good shot. Undoubtedly the Galaxy Z Fold 2 gets the job done but when great cameras like the iPhone 11, Pixel 4 and OnePlus 8 take images with zero input, this camera falls well short of what I expect.</p>
<p><img title="Z-Fold-2-Review-09-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1a2f67389b.jpg" alt="Z Fold 2 Review 09 1" /></p>
<p>There are other things you get with this phones camera that no one else provides. The huge screen is the best view finder possible, even if it does feel like you’re one of those people that takes pictures with a tablet. As well as the software ‘flex mode’ allowing you to set the phone down half flexed to stabilise your image, or simply view images you have snapped in the bottom half. Bear in mind though you have to place the phone down on its screen to do this.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While I would stop short of recommending this phone to others because of cost and the ways in which you need to change the way you use your phone, for a certain type of user this is going to be invaluable. It provides something to no other device on the market can provide, not just in the way it works, but the way it makes you feel. You feel as though you are using a little slice of the future and getting something out of your phone that no-one else does.</p>
<p>I can somewhat forgive the camera because I am getting a folding device that immerses me into whatever I want to do. You can play games, multi-task and consume media on this like no other device can and that speaks volumes. I love the Galaxy Z Fold 2 because it has that little something about it, it’s not the best at everything but it provides something unique and does it brilliantly.</p>
<p>If you really want a folding tablet, then look no further than this model. It fixes all the issues from the first one and puts them in a premium package that feels worth very bit of the price you are paying. But let’s be clear, to buy the Galaxy Z Fold 2 you need to really <em>want</em> a folding tablet because you will pay for it. Both in the high price tag and also in the caveats of having such a large device.</p>
<p>It comes down to do the advantages of having such a large screen to use, out weigh the downsides of carrying it around on your pocket all the time. For me, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 feels like wearing your winter coat all year because it is cold half the time, but for others this is going to be a game changer.</p>

Where exactly does Whatsapp fall into these issues?</p>
<p>You can jump up and down about algorithms and Facebooks willingness to manipulate engagement. You can worry about Mr Zuckerbergs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/facebook-trump-free-speech.html">free spech bubble</a> all you like, but the simple fact is Whatsapp doesnt have any of these inputs, but is a top contender for spreading Fake News.</p>
<p>It is not as simple as simply blaming Social Media for eveything, undoubtedly it is a leading cause of social issues, but it is infinitely more complax than the surface level issues pointed at.</p>

<p>Currently, I am learning front end coding skills, as well as digesting all the information I can find relating to user experience, not just for the web but everywhere else. Part of this is learning the true meaning of design.</p>
<p>Not just making things look pretty, making them usable, easy to understand and creating better experiences for everyone. These skills have opened my eyes to the lack of design and thought that goes into many things in the world, and something that started out as a simple learning exercise has changed the way I look at the world completely.</p>
<p>My town recently has been turned upside down by closing a railway bridge and blocking off traffic from getting through one of the main routes in and out. The signs placed on the approaching road simply read “Road Closed Ahead” and many people <em>still</em> got stuck. People started blaming drivers for not paying attention, and all sorts of random reasons, but it became clear to me that the planners didn’t design their experience well enough.</p>
<p>Road closed signs mean nothing to people that don’t know which road is actually closed, nor that the bridge is closed. The lack of thought and planning the experience of people leads to chaos for a few days until someone realised their mistake. People using routes in and out of the town can’t rely on local knowledge like the planners can, they have inside knowledge that allows them to understand the underlying information, but not see the actually message they are giving.</p>
<p>In everything you create you must think, plan, design and get feedback from others. It is often hard to see thorough other people eyes, and failure to realise that others may not have the same level of insight as you can lead to failure. A few traffic jams are nothing to worry about in the grand scheme of things, but if a customer doesn’t understand where to check out they won’t buy from you. If a reader doesn’t understand what you are explaining they won’t be a reader much longer.</p>

     <p>I am currently walking a new path of self-discovery. I haven’t disappeared to India or been on any vision quests to find myself (yet), but as a whole, I was simply not happy the way I was going, so I changed direction. The choices I was making and things I was doing were affecting the way I felt and, like many people, I simply disliked the way I felt.</p><p>Working online all day, every day and then spending large portions of my free time online was becoming a drain on my mind. I was filling every little slice of boredom with Twitter, Reddit, or mindless scrolling the web that I was becoming frustrated with myself.</p><p>Like every bad tradesman the knee-jerk reaction was to blame the tools. Blame the internet, web designers, and all the things around me for being made to distract me. I sought out a smaller phone, one that I didn’t feel like using as much, I restricted my usage of the internet when not working, and time blocked my calendar to make me indistractable while working.</p><p>This worked, it made me realise that I was turning a ridiculous potion of my life into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_time">dead time</a>. Passively waiting or searching for something to distract me and give me something to do. I didn’t even know these things were distracting me, because I had no idea what I wanted to be gaining traction towards. By removing those things I filled my time with allowed me to read more, do more, and have more meaningful relationships. Exactly the types of things that life should be built around and that make me a much happier person.</p><p>I am not exaggerating when I say that removing many of the things that I used to find important in my life allowed me to see how utterly meaningless they were. It is true that you must let go of what you love the most, and see if it returns, and as I let go of a lot of social media usage, it never returned.</p><p>While in internet is full of ways to grab your attention from you, and getting worse the deeper we go into <a href="/2020/09/01/the-trickle-down.html">the attention economy</a>, it is not the reason I was so distracted. Manipulation by platform developers only goes so far toward hacking your brain. What I quickly realised was that I had a choice to do these things or not, it was internally that I was so susceptible to the triggers used.</p><p>I started paying attention to the triggers that whisked me away down an internet rabbit hole, and by and large, it wasn’t the internet's fault — it was mine. When I was honest with myself and realised that because of my internal triggers I was searching for things to fill my time, the external triggers worked like a charm. I didn’t need to resort to a worse phone, or disconnect myself — I just needed to be mindful of the distractions and make myself <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Indistractable-Control-Your-Attention-Choose-ebook/dp/B07QCC61Y3/">indistractable</a>.</p>

<p>I realised after sending last weeks newsletter that I never completed the story of my lust for a simpler time. It didn’t end as <a href="https://gr36.com/cant-go-back/">far back as I wanted to go</a>, because there is no denying in the modern world I pretty much <em>have</em> to have an smartphone, but it thankfully got pretty far.</p>
<p>I am now the proud owner of two iPhone SE’s (SEes? SI?). I bought a used OG iPhone SE first, and used this for a week of peace. The size shift was much easier than I expected and my non essential usage dropped to zero. During this period though the battery life was a huge issue, and I resorted to buying a 2020 iPhone SE instead.</p>
<p>I am not exaggerating when I say that this phone is the best one I have ever owned. For £429 I have a phone that is much lighter, easier to manage and has all the modern innards I love. I have made some bold statements on <a href="https://gr36.com/links/we-might-be-getting-that-120hz-iphone-12-after-all/">not being interested in anything new Apple has to offer</a>, but I honestly could not see myself using anything else without a <em>really</em> good reason. I may write a longer thought post on ‘downgrading’ at a later date, but it safe to say I am over the moon with a simpler tech life.</p>
<p>I have a new level of emotional ambivalence towards my smartphone and I wish others did. I love the connectivity options it gives me, but don’t like having to use it — weird I know.</p>

     <p>You will never in your life posses something that is as important as your attention. The notice you take of someone or something is so craved after that throughout history those that have sought it have performed some of the worst and best acts humankind has ever seen. Yet we give it away without a moment of thought towards where it is spent.</p><p>The Accident Greeks wrote the very tale many of the modern condition are named after, Narcissus could be a tale told today about Instagram influencers or Facebook moms groups. Its tale told us the dangers of too much attention, and hinted at how much it is worth, but in modern times the most valuable thing we have is being manipulated, sought by companies, and trickled down onto us like drug crazed zombies.</p><p>Alphabet and Facebook are two of the richest companies in the world. Both companies rely heavily if not solely on the user as their product. Sure Facebook may attempt to sell cameras now, and Google does give you a suite of apps and sell a few phones, but these are drops in the ocean compared to the advertising they sell.</p><p>You are the most important thing to them, you are the thing they lust after, your attention the fuel that grids the gears of their business and you are being manipulated for it. Having your <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00556G7LU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">attention span shortened and your ability to concentrate eroded</a> simply so companies can make money from you. Using <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2020/09/2018-06-27-deceived-by-design-final/">dark patterns and un-ethical web design</a> to manipulate our base instinct and change our brains and erode our society.</p><blockquote>Facebook – Takes your data in exchange for being able to brag about yourself and stalk your friends. – <a href="https://www.nathanlustig.com/siren-servers-why-are-we-ok-with-giving-away-our-data/">Nathan Lustig</a></blockquote><p>As Justin Lanier <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jaron-lanier-tech-oracle-profile">points out</a> Social media is in some ways “worse than cigarettes, in that cigarettes don’t degrade you. They kill you, but you’re still you.” Social media is changing us for the worst, creating attention seeking, narcissistic ego driven monsters that can’t even see what’s wrong. Like many addicts, heavy users react with aggression and dismissal at the very suggestion of being manipulated and cheated out of their attention.</p><h2 id="all-eyes-on-me">All Eyes On Me</h2><p>Unfortunately, it is no longer the companies themselves that crave the attention you so easily give away. So much effort is placed on gaining your attention that now, users crave it themselves too. On every platform that promotes the sharing of information attention is sought from others. Users are encouraged to share more and more personal details about their daily life for others to see, and companies to use to show you better adverts.</p><p>It is even evident in niche services such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/iiabox/strava_wankers_rant/g36ouxt/">Strava</a> and <a href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/zwift-cracking-cheats-hackers-organisation-polices-racing-434487">Zwift</a>, both platforms designed to benefit athletic training and improve fitness. There is no reason for cheating on platforms like this, other than internet points. Nothing is gained from being at the top, or using a car instead of a bike to map your ride, other than to receive the attention they crave.</p><p>Don’t think this is a young persons game either, in fact, some evidence suggests that this constant craving for attention exists worse in middle-aged individuals. Cases of people <a href="https://www.mentalhelp.net/advice/craving-attention/">seeking help for this kind</a> of conditions has skyrocketed in modern times. Not keeping feelings like this in check can evolve into Histrionic personality disorder (HPD) and affect the lives of individuals. Many doctors believe that HPD is shaped by the psychological factors of an individuals surroundings. Heavy users of social media with reduced personal interaction could be having <a href="https://psychcentral.com/disorders/histrionic-personality-disorder/">their personality shaped</a> by their online environment.</p><p>Although attention seeking is fairly common in childhood, the skills needed to cope with these stressors are formed in early life. As much as a child learns that by creating a scene they have all the eyes on them, an adult learns that attention can off set insecurities, help cope with jealousy focused on others, and any number of feelings they are unable to deal with.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="uploads/2024/fc39e84479.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="5184" height="3456" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@gaberce?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Gabe Pierce</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="it-s-all-harmless-fun">It’s All Harmless Fun</h2><p>Unfortunately, it is easy to see why. It’s hard to find a downside to all the attention people can gain, but a few posts online fishing for feedback is one thing, but if these feelings can quickly resolved into conditions such as <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/ConditionsAndTreatments/munchausen-syndrome">Munchausen syndrome</a>. A particularly nasty metal illness that leads to the faking of illness so more attention and focus is gained by the individual. Something that can also be suffered by proxy, and resulted in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley_Allitt">death of four children, and injury to many more</a> by one person in the 1990’s. So next time you think that attention seeking is harmless, makes sure you realise how important it is.</p><p>This was long before the likes of Facebook and Instagram came along, meaning mental illness could be exacerbated in modern times. As attention is so much easier to attain when you can speak to millions of people in seconds. Munchausen syndrome now features a <a href="https://insights.ovid.com/article/00007611-200093070-00006">‘by internet’</a> variation specifically for those that deceive people with fake illness for attention on the internet. Attention is so easy to gain online if you just know the right buttons to press and the right things to do. But you can’t blame this all on individuals, because of course all the attention sought by users means fantastic business for the companies selling adds.</p><p>More eyeballs on websites means more money in the bank account from people wishing to advertise to you. Platforms are built with these types of things in mind. Attention, chaos and emotions outpouring onto their website leads more eyeballs and more adverts seen. Remember the psychological stress we talked about earlier that can lead to all sorts of mental health issues. Well, Facebook were caught out <a href="//www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2014/06/28/facebook-manipulated-user-news-feeds-to-create-emotional-contagion/#7177023e39dc">manipulating emotional distress</a> in their news feed, just for users attention. Unfortunately for its users, if Zuckerberg needs attention, the users must provide it, and by the bucket load.</p><p>Social media usage doesn’t cause metal health issues, but the constant push for more and more attention can breed the conditions for it to flourish. Sure enough, only an individual can judge if social media is a distraction or not, and giving something your attention is one thing, but being manipulated intentionally to waste more and more time is another. Business models built around attention and time spent on site has shifted much of our society to a new way of life. One where our time and our ability to concentrate are not being stollen, they are being given away freely. Nothing good can come of this.</p>

<p>It was reading this post when it finally hit me, I am so far removed from things like this now that I simply couldn’t care less about screen refresh rates and other bells and whistles.</p>
<p>I am no longer interested in reading or even thinking about rumours of new iPhones. Specs and supposed innovations such as a higher refresh rate no longer dictate my buying decisions.</p>
<p>A year ago I would have been all over these types of things, giving my opinions and talking about it to anyone that would listen. I would have convinced myself that I NEED this new model because the screen will be so much better to use.</p>
<p>Now, every feature rumour I see does not make a difference to the way I use my phone any longer. Which is sparingly and for quick little tasks.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I take out loads of free trials. What can I say I am a sucker for a freebie and even if I have no intention of paying out any money for an app or service I will sign up and try it for a bit. It’s a great way to be exposed to new things and test things out, as with something like <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/roam-research/">Roam Research</a>, I am sometimes surprised and sign up anyway.</p>
<p>This can be a nightmare on the web, after some nasty accidents I have to set reminders to cancel services with a link in plenty of time, so I don’t get charged. Yet on iOS all of that stress is taken away from me, and Apple will even warn me just before I am due to pay with a small heads up. Delete an app with an active subscription, Apple warns me with a pop up — and if I want to cancel anything they are all in one easy to manage page right on my phone.</p>
<p>Couple this with the fact I can pay Apple and not have to go through any websites and give my information to anyone else and I will gladly pay a little extra to keep my information safe and not get any unwanted expenditure.</p>
<p>I understand this is a fairly unique position to be in, but when the worst comes the worst and money leaves your bank, if Apple handles everything you know where to turn. Where would I go if an app or service I signed up for on my iPhone takes money from me but Apple didn’t handle the payments? Left to try and get in touch with a company I know very little about.</p>
<p>even when making payments for things online, I always opt for the Apple Pay or Paypal option because I simply don’t trust many other options. I don’t have to worry about the security and practices of the company I am buying from because they only get basic information about me. In some cases they won’t even receive my email!</p>
<p>What is there not to love about one company doing it all for you, that company could be Apple, Google, or whoever, the point is I have one company to worry about and I trust Apple more than any other company on the planet to do the job well and keep me secure.</p>
<p>I thought long and hard about this post, it has squandered in my drafts folder for a few days for risk of being drawn into an argument I don’t care about. This is no comment on the current issues surrounding how much Apple takes as its cut or blocks apps that try other options. It is simply my opinion that I am thrilled the Apple manages everything for me.</p>

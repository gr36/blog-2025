     <p>Except I didn’t, I sat at my desk and turned on my iPad. Open up <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/finding-a-use/">Drafts</a> and simply typed a few words into the endless posts I have been working on for ages and then opened Twitter. The same Twitter I have been staring at for 20mins previously, before getting to the end of the new posts in the Apple sub-Reddit.</p><p>This has been my life for the past few weeks, since spending obscene amounts of money on the iPhone XS I think I have been searching to add in value. Never bored, never happy to sit and think about things as I would do even a month ago. Double and tripling my pickups in an hour (thanks screentime) and generally making myself feel unhappy.</p><p>Why do I bounce around the same few apps looking for entertainment? Well depending on who you listen to it’s just the way of the world now, or the worse thing to happen to the world in a long time. I would lean more towards the latter opinion – but I just can’t help myself. It’s not the phones fault, it’s not the app makers fault (well maybe a little) it is mine. I don’t want to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/20/turning-smartphone-greyscale-attention-distraction-colour">turn my phone grayscale</a>, remove loads of apps or god forbid <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-10-15-the-new-palm-is-a-tiny-phone-to-keep-you-away-from-your-phone-the-verge/">buy a dumb phone</a>. I love having a computer in my pocket and information at my finger tips, but I need to find some kind of solution.</p><p>Intentional Twitter usage seems to have gone by the way side and I am becoming something that I detest. Hopefully by simply acknowledging my tendency to do this more often will help break the cycle, because something has to give. I even contemplated <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-finally-deletedfacebook/">logging into Facebook</a> and this gave me the wake up call I needed. At least I did write a blog post in the end, but not about what I intended to, I can’t even remember my idea.</p>

<p>After a few days of false information, forum posts that have half truths in them and a couple of telephone calls – I have managed to set up my iPhone XS with dual sims and here is how to do it.</p>
<h2><strong>Preparation</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to go dual sim on your iPhone XS there are a few ways, but one of your sims is going to have to become an eSim. This technology isn’t new but Apple are the first to do it mass market and in the UK it is only supported by EE at the moment. Unfortunately this is only currently available for pay monthly personal tariffs but they claim to be expanding the roll out in the coming months. So you won’t have the option on pay as you go, flex or business accounts.</p>
<h2><strong>Get An eSim</strong></h2>
<p>If you are in the market for a new contract, then one from EE might be the best way forward, simply ask them for an eSim instead of a regular sim and you’re all set. Keep in mind that if the second sim you wish to use is for a different network then you will need to wait 6 months and request your phone to be unlocked. If both accounts are on EE, simply put your physical sim in and go through the set up options to assign a primary and secondary number.</p>
<h2><strong>Transfer To An eSim</strong></h2>
<p>If you have an unlocked phone (like me) or choose to get your iPhone XS unlocked after 6 months, you will need to transfer your EE regular sim to an eSim. To do this you will need an eSim pack, with a QR code to scan. You can get these in stores, or the easiest way is to call 150 and request one. You should get this in the post the next day so you wont have to wait too long, the people on the phone I spoke to are very knowledgeable and will guide you through the process as in-depth as you wish.</p>
<p>Make sure you request a replacement eSim pack as this will be either sent with your number attached or without a number at all. Once this arrives head into the settings on iOS 12.1 and go to Mobile Data &gt; Add data plan. This is where you scan your QR code and are guided through the set up process, your phone might get a bit confused once finished, so pop out your standard sim and reboot your phone. EE state up to 24hours for activating the eSIm, but in reality you should be set up in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps you out a little as most info online is very generalised. If you need help in setting up the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT209044">primary and secondary options</a> in iOS head over to Apple support pages for a great explainer.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>With all the drama surrounding iPad reviews circling again I posed myself a little thought experiment. When all is said and done, and I could only choose one device to ‘work on’ forever – what device would it be?</p>
<p>It took me some time to run through all possibilities, come up with a few work arounds and a little bit of work to stay neutral. Surprisingly, I think I would have to choose a MacBook. Simply because I know with 100% certainty I can get 100% of everything done on a MacBook. Unfortunately at this moment in time I can’t say that about the iPad.</p>
<p>That isn’t to say the iPad is useless. I still choose to use it for the vast majority of my daily tasks. It is far more powerful, versatile, portable and has better battery life than almost any laptop on the market. Combine that the fact that honestly I much prefer working on iOS to macOS and I would choose the iPad most of the time. What is different to all of these review posted at the moment, is that I wouldn’t claim either of these machines are useless.</p>
<p>What many reviews are pointing to is the same arguments that we had when the original iPad Pro was released. If it doesn’t work for you that’s ok, choose a MacBook or an iMac or a Windows machine. That is perfectly ok and more power to you. However that doesn’t make the other options useless for others. Let’s all choose the machine that fits in best with our workflow and requirements and carry on. I am just thankful that all of these options exist in a modern ecosystem full of potential.</p>
<p>The new iPad Pro no doubt will move even closer to me dropping a laptop, if I can just work out podcasting! For more thoughts, check out <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-11-07-GR36-01/">my solo podcast</a> launched today.</p>

<p>The opinions on Agenda app range from excitement to confusion but it has caused quite a stir in iOS productivity circles. The developers are constantly improving the app and there are now a bunch of automation options available for Agenda via x-callback URL.</p>
<p>You can use these in Shortcuts or a whole range of automation apps and here is a breakdown of what you can do.</p>
<h2>Open</h2>
<p>On-the-agenda view<br />
<code>agenda://x-callback-url/on-the-agenda<br />
</code></p>
<p>Open the Today overview<br />
<code>agenda://x-callback-url/today<br />
</code></p>
<p>Open a project<br />
<code>agenda://x-callback-url/open-project?title=[project title]<br />
</code></p>
<p>Open a note<br />
<code>agenda://x-callback-url/open-note?title=[title text]<br />
</code></p>
<h2>Create</h2>
<p>Create a new note<br />
<code>agenda://x-callback-url/create-note?project-title=[project name]&amp;title=[title text]&amp;text=[body text]<br />
</code></p>
<p>Append to existing note<br />
<code>agenda://x-callback-url/append-to-note?title=[title text]&amp;text=[body text]<br />
</code></p>
<h2>Optional extras</h2>
<p>Add in extras to the end of the url if you need some more control. These are not mandatory.</p>
<p>On the agenda<br />
<code>&amp;on-the-agenda=[true or false]<br />
</code></p>
<p>Specific date<br />
<code>&amp;date=[year]-[month]-[day]<br />
</code></p>
<p>Start and/or end dates<br />
<code>&amp;start-date=yesterday&amp;end-date=tomorrow<br />
</code></p>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p><code>agenda://x-callback-url/create-note?project-title=My%20Project&amp;title=New%20Note&amp;text=Hello%20World&amp;on-the-agenda=true&amp;date=2018-03-12<br />
</code></p>
<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p><code>agenda://x-callback-url/create-note?project-title=Blogposts&amp;title=New%20Post29&amp;text=Hello%20World&amp;on-the-agenda=false&amp;start-date=yesterday&amp;end-date=tomorrow</code></p>

<p>On the second Friday of the month I add up all my mileage and there is never a time when the total doesn’t scare me. It’s always north of 2500 miles a month and I’m starting to wonder if that’s good for me.</p>
<p>I am sure there are people that do many more, yet presuming I take the regular 1 month off throughout the year. I spend at least 27,000 miles alone just driving. Taking out all traffic jams and other hold ups and accounting for me travelling everywhere at 60mph – that’s 458hours of my year. 19 whole days!!</p>
<p>Add into this time spent eating, waiting for appointments or alone in a hotel room and it’s starting to look pretty scary. I love my job but perhaps I spend too much time alone.</p>
<p>My time is never wasted, I spend all of this time listening to podcasts and audio books – as Aubrey Marcus says <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B076Z6KFWL/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1?tag=gr36-21">practicing mindfillness</a>. Yet I still feel like I spend too much time alone and long term this isn’t good for me. I guess maximising the time I am around people is the key to improving myself.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks there has been a great <a href="https://marco.org/2018/10/09/infograph-legibility">deal of negativity</a> about Apple Watch faces. Much like criticism of the <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-04-05-apple-watch-honeycomb/">honeycomb layout</a>, I have no idea why it has taken 4 iterations of the Apple Watch for users to start moaning about custom watch faces, but they are now very vocal.</p>
<p>I must outline that I say <em>users</em> with a broad stroke, because some of those most critical of the first party faces are not Apple Watch users at all. I do agree with some of the criticism though, as since the small changes to Apple Watch face design in watchOS5 I can’t settle on just one.</p>
<p>I have used the same watch face for almost the entire time I have owned one (since launch bar about 4 weeks of vacation before the last version). My only issues with the current watch faces are that too many of them are appealing but fall short in some way. Some are overly complex and feature too much information, some fall short of not having enough complications, and unfortunately some are just not my cup of tea at all.</p>
<p>However it must be said that I don’t think allowing developers to create a huge number of faces to choose from would fix many of the issues. In actual fact I think it might make choices much worse. If Apple were to relinquish some control over the face they must insist on a certain level of complication use or design, both of which I have doubts if that would even be possible to control.</p>
<p>Much like with the iPhone home screen users must relinquish their personal tastes to a certain extent and accept the design choices Apple makes. Although with the ‘most personal product’ I think some wiggle room is needed. There <em>are</em> too many faces with a similar design, and there <em>are</em> areas to hugely improve, but my solution is to use several for different situations and swipe between them. So I don’t need to settle on one watch face anymore.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I remember getting my very first Android phone. After using iPhones for a very long time I switched to the new comer in town. The Galaxy S was shiny and new, and all I had to worry about was putting my sim in and transferring my contacts. I felt like I was some kind of rebel, sporting an underdog and not conforming to convention.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, even transferring contacts was pretty tricky at the time as Apple were even more locked down that they are now and I opted to just write them all down and type them back in. This was the most complicated part of the process, but these simple days are long gone. You must have a serious desire to reach escape velocity now, and it feels a little bit claustrophobic.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>App Investment</strong></strong></h2>
<p>After even a small amount of time spent using iOS there can be a considerable investment in applications. The average spend on iOS users in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/21/iphone-average-app-spending-2016/">US is $40 a year</a>, all of this investment is useless when switching to a different OS. Several apps have introduced subscription services that will in theory work cross platform, this will help to mediate those issues. However there is no guarantee that there is even apps available on alternative platforms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately many of the high profile applications that have adopted this model are simply not available on other platforms. Granted the average Joe may have nothing to worry about other than than their phone. However more and more people are buying Apple Watches, iPads and Apple TVs than you think. These are satellite devices to everyone and all aid to keep customers from leaving.</p>
<p>No longer is the only investment a mobile phone and perhaps a few accessories. Manufacturers are creating a whole range of devices with different levels of pull, designed to make the overall experience as good as possible. It is without doubt that certain devices have more pull than other devices – higher gravity if you will. So reaching that escape velocity from iOS is much harder when you take into account everything that goes with it. Arguably I would miss the connivence of AirPods and the ease of a cellular Apple Watch (these are my favourite Apple devices over the last few years) more than an iPhone.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only option is just accept my fate <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/leaning-into-the-apple-lock-in/">and lean in</a>? I have already embraced the fact that unless something drastic changes it would be almost impossible for me to switch <em><em>everything</em></em> but not impossible for me to change some things. The trick is to not let the brand overtake your opinions, I try very hard to be open to changing and neutral in my opinions. Event though I live the Mac life doesn’t mean opinions should be influenced – although not being a <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-10-25-not-being-a-fan-boy-is-hard/">fan boy is really hard</a>!</p>

<p>For the last few months I have (had) been journaling. I won’t bore you with the details but jotting down a few notes once or twice a day in the Day One app (<a href="https://gr36.com/2017-12-20-day-one-review/">my review</a>) had been helping tremendously. Bringing thoughts to the front of my mind and working through issues or decisions easier. Almost as if I were to have a conversation with myself and reach conclusions from it.</p>
<p>Trouble is, as with everything in life, as soon as you start feeling better the things that pushed you forward fade into the background. We all do it, as soon as the feelings stop we stop doing the practices that have got it through to the other side. I stopped journaling, didn’t meditate as much and I’m now kicking myself. It isn’t the first time, and won’t be the last as it happens for everything from exercise and weight loss goals to taking medication.</p>
<p>Working full time, having a side hustle, podcasting and writing is simply too much work for me to take on. You would have seen it in the lack of blog posts, heard it in the podcast and felt it with my distant tweets. However it is time to build myself again – I have spent some time working on getting my blog to look the way I want and hopefully the posts will follow suit.</p>
<p>10 days away from technology has made me more conscious of my usage, made me focus on what is important to me and actually allowed me to be more focused going forward.</p>

<p>The simple fact is, Apple like removing things. From home buttons, the MacBook Pro ports, to <a title="headphone jacks" href="https://gr36.com/2017-08-27-iphone7-headphonejack/">headphone jacks</a> — there is a relentless march towards a simple unibody design with as few cutouts as possible. It makes the design of technology sleek, appealing and arguably leaves more room for important things like battery. Although it’s only when you start using a device that cares more about usability than looking ‘sexy’ you realise this is the wrong move. I’m not saying have buttons for everything but I think it’s time for a dedicated camera button on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple place a ridiculous amount of priority on the iPhone camera. Constantly improving the quality of the shots, and plowing money into #shotoniphone advertising. Yet they don’t seem to care about getting to the camera as quickly as possible. Teaching people <a title="how to shoot the best pictures" href="https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone/photography-how-to/">how to shoot the best pictures</a> is one thing, but the easy capture of important moments is much more important to the everyday user.</p>
<p>Android phones are the leaders in launching the camera as quick as possible. Samsung did it with a double tap of the home button, Motorola has a double twist and even my BlackBerry Key2 has multiple options for friction free captures. All of which are easier than the lock screen shortcuts introduced in iOS11, or the swipe left on the home screen that has existed for years. All these actions seem to do is increase the chance of taking a picture of your pocket or turning on the torch accidentally.</p>
<p>This is without considering that a dedicated key would allow you to launch the camera regardless of what you are doing at the time. At the moment it requires multiple taps and swipes to get to the camera if you are using another app. The ability to launch the camera from every screen is a huge deal, and one that allows you to capture moments much quicker and easier.</p>
<p>Instead, Apple have removed buttons and increased complexity of the interaction with them. The power button is now the <a title="side button" href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/09/09/iphone-x-side-button/">side button</a> on the iPhone X and users must relearn to tap, double tap or hold down with other buttons dependent on what you want to achieve — whist keeping the side toggle! It seems self-evident that Android manufactures think about what is the most convenient for their users, and it is time for Apple to do the same. Give us a camera button and allow us to capture even <a title="more shot on iPhone" href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/02/25/shot-on-iphone-x-first-dance/">more shot on iPhone</a> pictures.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>This isn’t the right thing to say but I dread taking my daughters wheelchair anywhere new. Most places are great but I can’t escape the feeling of dread because it only takes one poor experience to put you off completely – thankfully London was pretty great.</p>
<h2><strong>Train To London</strong></h2>
<p>After having an awful time when traveling to Nottingham with a mobility scooter I wasn’t holding up much hope. However from arriving on the platform to getting off the other end the experience was great. We were apparently supposed to book disabled access, however this isn’t very prominent when booking tickets – because there wasn’t any space we managed to get a free upgrade to first class. Obviously this wont happen to everyone, but the staff we spoke to seemed to genuinely care about getting us the best service possible.</p>
<h2><strong>London Underground</strong></h2>
<p>Let it never be said that the underground doesn’t have good disabled access, because all things considered it does. Some stations are easier than others (we tested quite a few considering the circle line was shut) but look out for the blue disabled badges as they are strep free to street level. Also be prepared to take multiple lifts, and have to hunt around for them. We used a grand total of 21 lefts during our day in London, some better signed than others and we did plenty of pushing in between.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="tour_img-1959392-99-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ed65c81b63.jpg" alt="Tour img 1959392 99 1" width="1585" height="792" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>London Eye</strong></h2>
<p>It was from here onwards we really started to see the people that really cared about our experience. There is a stark difference between those that put in accessibility equipment for regulation and those that really care about allowing access for everyone. Staff at the London Eye went out of their way to get us through as easy as possible, they stop the wheel for everyone with issues getting on, and will place and ramp for those in a chair.</p>
<p>That’s not to say the experience went without a hiccup, getting into the cordoned off line was a nightmare, with people punching in from all angles and people clearly didn’t care about the wheelchair. This wasn’t the staffs fault, but be prepared to be a little assertive and you’ll get on great.</p>
<h2><strong>London Aquarium</strong></h2>
<p>The staff and facility here is another shining example of really caring about access to all mobility issues. There are numerous lifts to navigate the floors of the aquarium, and plentiful disabled toilets throughout the journey. There are some sticky places, particularly the ‘Amazon’ section, where the floor is made to look as if walking in the rainforest, this is a harder to push through but not impossible.</p>
<p>All of the tanks are easy to see when you’re down a little lower, but be prepared to wait at the larger tanks to get towards then front. If possible I would allow extra time and aim for quieter times in order to see everything. At hands on areas, staff were set up to transfer a star fish into a container so Lucie could have a feel sat in her chair.</p>
<p>Only once were the words “never again” muttered, when trying to work our way though the maze of lifts in Kings Cross. However all said everywhere provided great access and we had a great experience. Disabled access is experiencing a sea change at the minute and I am excited to see everywhere become easy to access for us.</p>

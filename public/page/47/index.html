      <p>Over the last few weeks, I am having to spend more and more time in an office environment. There’s no rhyme or reason for it apart from the things I need to do need me to be there. I can slowly but surely feel my happy working from home routine being washed away.</p>
<p>I am dead sure there isn’t, but it feels like every little step is some kind of grand plan to remove ‘the new normal’ and return to the old way. Perhaps working as we always did <em>is</em> the way to do it, but all I know is that I am happier, healthier and more productive working in my own home.</p>
<p>Who knows what the future will bring, but the current requirements are playing on my mental health and productivity, and as a result my home life.</p>

      <p>Where to actually start? Every so often we see the once great Instagram app slide into oblivion, barely clinging on to its importance to the users that have used it for more than a decade. Unfortunately, there isn’t a service that comes close to the reach that Instagram has, but hopefully that will change if they keep going the way they are.</p><p>The latest round of excuses making is not new information, but when a <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/kim-kardashian-and-kylie-jenner-lock-horns-with-the-head-of-instagram-over-tiktok-redesign-12659928">Kardashian chips in,</a> companies tend to answer. With that said, this isn’t because of some altruistic intentions. The Kardashians make their living from social media, and clearly the effects of Meta changing the way the app works is affecting the bottom line.</p><p>Casey Newton summed this up expertly in an edition of his <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/kylie-jenner-smacks-the-new-instagram">Platformer newsletter</a> (paywall), an <a href="https://overcast.fm/+QN1qZ9HF0/34:12">episode of The Vergecast</a> and also a <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1551685200463028224?s=20&amp;t=1DKkMp3JQfZYs7yUMS6-1Q">widely shared Twitter thread</a>. He is dead right in conclusion — if you don’t like it, tough because Facebook has all the data, and it knows what it’s doing. Plus, it doesn’t care about you.</p><p>Adam Mosseri was <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1551890839584088065?s=20&amp;t=1DKkMp3JQfZYs7yUMS6-1Q">fairly quick to come out and answer some feedback</a> (again) following the Kardashian post. As if by magic, the same message is released, with intense stares into the camera and quick jump cuts between points. Because that’s how you do things to be down with the kids. It was long winded and clearly scripted but there are a couple of points to press on in this specific message.</p><h2 id="photos">Photos</h2><p>So, where does this leave photos. As a photographer, I wholeheartedly believe that Meta does not give a damn about photos. It is a legacy which they would get rid of if they could. All the surrounding words were half-hearted and stale. Using words like “continuing to support photos” without actually showing any excitement or reassurances to those that are left out.</p><p>With this shift to mobile first video, they are also forcing photographers to either use a terrible 16:9 vertical crop that is even worse than the 4:5 one that went before it. The alternative is having your photo fade out at the bottom and look terrible. None of this was pointed out in the video, however, because Adam is <em>loves</em> photos after all.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/445f9992d4.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><h2 id="video-reels">Video &amp; Reels</h2><p>The shift to videos was doubled down on. In no uncertain terms, this is <em>the</em> way Instagram is going, and its users are simply going to have to get used to it. In his words, “I do believe that more and more of Instagram is going to become video”.</p><p>The powers at Instagram see video as the future because they simply do not want you using another app, and TikTok is the single biggest threat that Meta (and others) have ever faced. As such, they will shove videos down users throats, so they realise that Instagram does video, and isn’t just a place to cross post them.</p><p>Adam pointed out that even if they don't change anything else, more and more videos are being shared and that’s what the users like. This may be the case, but you only have to look at the volume of users that <em>have to</em> post videos to get the engagement they used to. My evidence is of course anecdotal, but I have not met a simple photographer that posts a Reel apart from that they have to, or they lose work.</p><p>Not all video growth on Instagram is down to this, but a large percentage of people sharing videos are those that make money on social media and as such have no choice but to join in with Reels posting. Add into this the users who are now cross posting their TikTok videos to Instagram because why not, and you surely have a gigantic boost in video sharing with only a small algorithm change from Meta.</p><p>“If you look at what people like and consume on Instagram, that’s also shifting increasingly towards video”. These words stuck out to me the most, what Adam left out was the last part of the sentence, which should have been “because they have no choice”. Mine, as with many peoples, relationship with Instagram is tenuous at the best of times. I really hate it, but I have to post if I want more people to see my stuff. So, as <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/24/instagram-may-be.html">I said before</a>, I’ll just carry on until it’s gone.</p>

      <p>It was a bit blustery and choppy out on the water, but an enjoyable hour walk with the pooch. Headed to the south shore and went a bit further south on the path until we got to the boat harbour.</p>
<p>I wish I had taken a longer lens and managed to get a better shot of the boats, but this way is well worth another visit in the near future. Also a bit easer to shoot with it not being so sunny and reflecting off the water.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;“While Instagram initially fueled my passion for photography; rather than being inspired through the art of photography itself, too often I find myself chasing numbers of followers and likes. I realized that all this time I wanted to share my work to get a ‘pat on the back,’ rather than to inspire,” photographer Nicole Malina told PetaPixel.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Same same. But what is the solution for me to see all the photographers I enjoy following? Check up on all of their portfolios every so often? Use a different service with a fraction of the users?</p>
<p>Neither of these are tenable. Instead I’ll keep using it and hating it</p>

<p>&ldquo;TikTok is said to collect “everything”, from search and browsing histories; keystroke patterns; biometric identifiers—including faceprints, something that might be used in “unrelated facial recognition technology”, and voiceprints—location data; draft messages; metadata; and data stored on the clipboard, including text, images, and videos.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>There was a weird sense of misplaced attention when Trump tried to ban TikTok during his tenure. Perhaps it was just hyperbole at the time but as pointed out above the Chinese based company gathers ridiculously large amounts of data on users.</p>
<p>Including information on your clipboard, which could be passwords and other sensitive information.</p>
<p>Of course no uses will actually care because they get to watch silly videos and meme dances….</p>

      <p>Mike Elgin on the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3666739/why-open-plan-offices-are-a-disaster-for-your-company.html">hopeful demise of open plan offices</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The open-plan office obsession, which probably peaked around ten years ago, was based on what I’ve called “collaboration bias” — the under-examined assumption that ad-hoc social encounters are more valuable for business, creativity, and productivity than un-interrupted “deep work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The amount of time wasted in stupid takes should be enough for companies to realise. Yet the insistence of all being together and maximising collaboration is based on lack of trust.</p>
<p>No one trusts their staff and fail to understand the true importance of deep work.</p>

      <p>We went to a Ninja Warrior experience park yesterday in Sheffield. It’s safe to say the kids were absolutely knackered at the end but we had loads of fun.</p>
<p>It’s for bigger children to be honest otherwise it’s like any other inflatable park. However James managed to do loads of the course trials.</p>
<p>Didn’t quite make it up the wall though ☹️</p>

      <p>I guess this is why the x100v always comes in handy, because if you just fancy shooting or something catches your eye you're ready to go.

      <p>Some of the Commonwealth joined us today to celebrate the Commonwealth touch being carried through our town. Great to see so many people lined up to see it travel around on its way to Birmingham.</p>
<p>It’s already traveled more than 2,500 miles through 180 countries. The games begin in a little over two weeks time.</p>

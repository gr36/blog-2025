      <p>The first Peter McKinnon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5fc7KQyXeg">video</a> I have watched in a while summed up a very modern photography problem perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>just go shoot a sunrise for no other reason than to absolutely fucking enjoy it. In the questions of what will you do with the photos? After. Who cares nothing, do absolutely nothing. If anything, it&rsquo;s just one for the books.</p></blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t have to be a sunrise of course, but just go shoot. Who cares what you get from it, what you do with it. Forget the likes you think you need, the stress of worrying what happened to Instagram and where you are going to post your photos. Just go shoot.</p>
<p>Remember why you picked up the camera in the first place.</p>

      <p>As I move my working life towards planning, proposing, and delivering on major projects, I’ve realized what a pain it can be. From the outside looking in, those three steps look easy, but to do them properly, you first need to outline exactly what the result <strong>shouldn’t</strong> achieve.</p>
<p>You read that right. More than anything else, the first step is to think about the worst possible solution you could deliver. This solution technically achieves the goal correctly but with all the wrong metrics. Andrew Wilkinson outlines this well in his post about <a href="https://medium.com/@awilkinson/the-power-of-anti-goals-c38f5f46d23c">The Power of Anti-Goals</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea that problems are often best solved when they are reversed. That it’s often easier to think about what you don’t want than what you do.</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s absolutely correct. It’s much easier to think about the worst way and then work backward to ensure you move in a better direction. A great example in Andrew’s post is considering what they didn’t want their positions in their company to be when building the company. They did not want to spend too much time away from their family nor be too busy and stressed and as such put checks and balances in place to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>Once you are aware of what you absolutely do not want to deliver, you tend to steer well clear of the pitfalls and issues that can plague a poorly thought-through project and deliver a better solution. At this point, it’s also important to ensure that you measure the project against company and personal values. No one wants to deliver a product they are ashamed of nor work on something they would rather not.</p>
<p>Ensuring your planning and project lives up to what you expect from it at this early stage makes for a much better experience all around. There are fancy words for these kinds of things, of course. Here’s a recent post discussing what and how <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/how-mike-does-mutli-scale-planning-in-obsidian/">Multi-Scale Planning is</a> and in true Sweet Setup style, how to do it in Obsidian:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multi-Scale planning is a way to make sure that your vision and your values get translated into your everyday actions.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think, now more than ever, it is important to deliver work that not only fits your expected level of quality but also fulfills your values as a person. That’s not going to be relevant for some projects; however, this important step enables you to ensure you do not deliver work you later regret. To use the words of Mike Monteiro in <em>Ruined by Design</em>: “Effect of what you put into the fabric of society should always be a key consideration in your work.”</p>
<p>So by bringing to mind what you do not want to deliver as an end product, you can be certain that the plans you now begin to put into place will deliver an end result you can be proud of.</p>

      <p>It was, as Thanos says, inevitable. I am so shockingly boring that I couldn’t stop working even for <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/05/13/a-day-off.html">one day off</a>. There was little point in tidying up after myself and trying to hide the fact that I can’t do other things. So, when all the family returned from their normal day at work and school, of course the question came.</p>
<p>The answer is a simple one, but a little bit painful to admit: I have nothing else in my life to do. I do have <em>things</em> to do, but not anything that I really want to do, and nothing to excite me for the few hours that were free. The truth is I am so exceptionally sad that there is very little else in my life to entertain me. I have tried for years to focus my mind elsewhere when these periods occur, but I inevitably find myself working.</p>
<p>To try and explain why is far too complicated a topic, one that may one day be recited on a therapist’s couch, but I theorize many reasons intertwined in my psyche. One of which is the relationship between myself and my technology. All of which are used for both personal and work tasks. As soon as I sat down to write my blog post earlier, I knew that I would end up checking my email, planning for my return tomorrow, and more than likely completing some simple things to check off my list.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I did get out for a little while today, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/05/13/a-walk-in.html">walked my dog in the woods</a> where we both enjoyed the sunshine. As well as doing some exercise, and finished watching Fallout. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Unfortunately, I always feel that there is something lacking to <em>do</em>. Many people I know spend these sorts of spare hours playing games or binge-watching TV, and I don’t think I can switch my brain off for long enough. All I have are books to read and blog posts to write, and there’s only so much of that you can do.</p>
<p>And so, I worked, on my day off.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For the first time in recent memory, I booked a day off from work today with absolutely nothing planned. My company leave is usually taken up by family holidays, hospital appointments, and other things that occupy my time, but today I am free to do whatever I please, which of course means absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Not that I don’t have anything to do; I have lots of things that could occupy my time, but I am incapable of deciding what to do. How do you decide which one of the million things to do that you have put off for a day like this? Just like my ‘someday’ task list, these things that I put off until I have the time to do them are often things I don’t really want to do. If they were, I would have set aside time for them anyway.</p>
<p>As such, my day will be filled with nothingness, and that&rsquo;s exactly how I like it. Walking my dog, enjoying the sun that is gracing the UK at the moment, and writing some blog posts. I feel a little bit like I have bunked off school, and instead of finding the nirvana that I expected, I instead have to wait around for everyone to finish school. This day will be ‘wasted’ and that’s perfect.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>My first exposure to computers and technology came at a very early age. My mum was convinced that I needed a computer to do my school work, and for reasons only known to her, bought me a ‘486’. I would later learn that this was a description of the processor in the machine, but all I could take in at the time was how massive it was and that I had to type everything to get it going. I wouldn&rsquo;t begin to use anything resembling a modern computer until much later with Windows 3.1.</p>
<p>Even then, technology wasn&rsquo;t really in my life. It was just a tool to use when needed, and that wasn’t very often. You would have to fast forward more than a decade until I became remotely interested in what these things could do for me, and this all happened by complete accident. With an iPhone that I purchased simply because I had an iPod. I’d had computers to do my college and school work, bought phones to text my friends, but this gadget entered my life and put just the right amount of restrictions in the way that I wanted to get around them.</p>
<p>I discovered that I could enable my primitive iPhone 3G to do more than Apple allowed. With a few lines of code, I could enable copy and paste, and MMS - as shocking as it seems now that an iPhone didn’t have these things. I installed beta software downloaded over peer-to-peer networks and network unlocked them for friends. This interesting world filled a hole in me that had been empty since my dreams of professional football were taken away from me in my late teens. The excitement, skills to learn, and ever-changing landscape was addictive and I can pretty much plot a course from iPhone purchase day to my working life now.</p>
<p>This course went through years of hacking Palm tablets, working with custom ROMs on Android, and writing for technology websites about anything and everything I could. Learning HTML and CSS to build my own blog and gaining the skills to go along with producing content for the web. Because of my love of technology, the people I met, and the skills I picked up along the way, I am where I am today. I am pretty confident to say that had I not bought that iPhone, my life would be a very different place.</p>
<p>Which brings me to today. My world is not as exciting as it once was. The technology that I love is now in a very different spot. It no longer sits idle until called upon like any other tool, it muscles its way into every corner of our lives. There is a lot to be excited about, but also a lot to be wary of. Modern life is a hard place to navigate, and if you’ve had to have this conversation with your children, you will appreciate that it seems to be getting worse. In many ways, we are the tools that technology companies use. To make more and more money while improving less and less about the world.</p>
<p>I cannot get excited about new iPads, task list apps, and camera specs as I used to, but I think that is because I am too jaded by the past. There are others out there that are as excited as past me was about OS updates and new phones, but for AI advancements and wearable technology. I didn’t worry about what these new smartphones would do to the world, and neither will they about LLM’s and image generators.</p>

      <p>Reysu in the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O6Ic0bM1GA">How to absorb books like a sponge and read 2x faster</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most valuable things you can do with your free time is reading books. They not only contain a huge depth of information, but just a single idea in a book has the possibility of changing your life entirely.</p></blockquote>
<p>I recently found Reysu on YouTube and have enjoyed a lot of the videos on their channel. It is a good mix of technology topics and various bits of life advice—particularly the ones on Notebooks, but that&rsquo;s for another day. I hate the title of this one and wrote about why <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2022/04/10/reading-doesnt-need.html">reading doesn’t need to be hacked</a>, but this statement in the first part of the video stood out to me.</p>
<p>Reading is one of my favorite things to do. I don’t know why, I have a million other things to entertain me, but reading takes me to a different place that nothing else can. There’s fiction to distract me but not leave me hollow like passive media does. There’s non-fiction for me to learn new ideas and improve my life. Whatever it is that I am reading, it contains loads of little bits that all leave their mark and improve me as a person.</p>
<p>Also a special shout out to this genius thumbnail that first got me to watch Reysu’s videos.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>After <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/04/25/i-managed-to.html">loosing my Kindle Paperwhite in London</a> a couple of weeks ago I have been a bit lost. I did order another one, but when <a href="https://thedent.net/post/the-kobo-libra-colour">posts started</a> <a href="https://maique.eu/2024/05/01/the-kobo-review.html">popping up</a> about a <a href="https://amzn.to/4abDTh0">colour Kobo Libra</a> I decided to return it and try something new. Granted I have only had it since Friday, but I am already in love with it.</p>
<p>I will no doubt write a longer post about it later, but there are not many downsides to this new device. It has a nice screen with colour, has a separately available stylus for note taking and highlighting which I love. However reporting those highlights is not a simple as with Kindle, but I found some ways to make use of them. The below works with the Kobo Libra Colour, Kobo Libra 2 and Kobo Clara Colour - so I don’t see any reason it shouldn’t work with others.</p>
<h2 id="in-a-text-file">In A Text File</h2>
<ol>
<li>Connect kobo to your device</li>
<li>Open a file browser and mount the device once connected</li>
<li>Allow your file browser to see hidden files ( CMD + Shift + . On Mac)</li>
<li>Go to the hidden folder <code>.kobo/Kobo</code></li>
<li>In a text editor open <code>eReader.conf</code></li>
<li>In the text file find (or if not present add <code>[FeatureSettings]</code></li>
<li>Add a new line <code>ExportHighlights=true</code></li>
<li>Save the file and unmount your device from the computer</li>
</ol>
<p>To export the notes from a book, long press on the book and tap <code>Export Annotations</code>.</p>
<p>When you reconnect your Kobo there will be a new file called Exported Annotations with text files for the exported books. Bear in mind this does not update with new ones, so consider doing this only when they need to be exported.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-06-at-17.24.01.png" alt=""><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-06-at-17.23.57.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There are some reports of truncated highlights where not all the content is exported in the text file. This has not happened to me, but please take this into consideration.</p>
<h2 id="using-a-calibre-plugin">Using A Calibre Plugin</h2>
<p>When it comes to self management and conversion of e-books, <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com?from=gregmorris.co.uk">Calibre</a> is king. I have been using it for a while to (cough) manage (cough) my Kindle e-books but it is even more invaluable when using a Kobo device. There is a wide range of plugins available and for this method we will add a new one - namely <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?from=gregmorris.co.uk">Annotations</a> by David Forrester.</p>
<p>Head to the preferences panel and click Plugins.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-06-at-17.15.29.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Click Get new plugins and search for <code>Annotations</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-06-at-17.15.38.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This will give you a couple of popups, one is a warning that plugins can contain malware - they are programmes after all. And once installed you will need to restart Calibre.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-06-at-17.15.48.png" alt="">
<img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-06-at-17.15.54.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once restarted, customise the plugin by clicking the big yellow highlighter in the top bar, and select Customise plugin.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-06-at-17.16.49.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the next window click the wand icon next to the Comments dropdown and add in the Annotations option. Once done click ok.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-06-at-17.17.02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now connect your Kobo device, and once Calibre recognises it, click the highlighter again and select Fetch annotations from connected device. The popup window will allow you to select which books have them available.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-06-at-17.18.33.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These will show in the book details window for ease of viewing, or you can copy and paste them for use elsewhere.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-05-06-at-17.20.33.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="use-readwise">Use Readwise</h2>
<p>If you use Readwise, or want a seamless way to sync your highlights, these can be directly added using the <a href="https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/10789206247703-Use-Readwise-to-view-and-manage-your-annotations">standard options</a>. They will sync to the Readwise service and also be accessible from any of your set up export options such as Notion or Obsidian.</p>
<p>However, this will only work for highlights made to Kobo purchased books. This <strong>will not work</strong> for manually added ePub books or PDFs. There is a solution for this pointed out by Readwise themselves, called <a href="https://utf9k.net/projects/october/">October</a>, that grabs these from a connected device - however I have not tested this out myself so cant speak for its usage.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2024/05/07/tie-your-camel.html"><h1 class="p-name">Tie Your Camel</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There’s a fascinating Arab proverb, &ldquo;Trust in Allah, but tie your camel,&rdquo; which serves as a powerful metaphor for the balance between faith and practicality. This adage has lingered in my mind, prompting reflections on how it applies not only to religious faith but to everyday life decisions as well.</p>
<p>In essence, the proverb teaches us that while it&rsquo;s crucial to have trust—whether in a higher power, the universe, or the intrinsic goodness of life—it&rsquo;s equally important to not neglect our responsibilities and duties. It suggests a harmonious approach to life, where faith and action go hand in hand. You trust in the larger forces at play, but you also take necessary precautions and actions to safeguard your immediate world.</p>
<p>Consider the scenario of preparing for an important exam. One might pray or hope for success, which is an act of faith. However, this doesn&rsquo;t replace the need for thorough preparation and study, which represents the act of tying your camel. It&rsquo;s about not leaving things to chance when you have the capacity to influence the outcome through your actions. We trust lots of things such as individuals to act accordingly to reliance on whole markets to correct themselves, when perhaps we can take action instead.</p>
<p>This proverb also taps into the theme of accountability. It reminds us that while we might put our faith in bigger concepts or future promises, we are still agents in our own lives. We have the power, and thus the responsibility, to take actions that align with our hopes and prayers. Whether it&rsquo;s as mundane as locking your car or as significant as planning your career path, the message is clear: be proactive.</p>
<p>This proverb offers a grounding thought. It teaches resilience and preparedness, urging us to handle what is within our control diligently, while remaining optimistic about what we can&rsquo;t control.These words are not just advice for the religious or the spiritual. It&rsquo;s a universal call to blend optimism with pragmatism, hope with effort, and faith with action. This balanced approach can help us remain both hopeful and effective. It’s a reminder that in the interplay of trust and responsibility, we find the wisdom to manage life’s uncertainties with confidence and grace.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>One of my most re-read books is Marcus Aurelius&rsquo; Meditations. I tend to pick it up often and read through some of the passages and often they can tell me something about what is currently happening in my life. A few days ago I happened upon a passage from Book 6.20, where he uses a gymnasium metaphor to deliver a profound insight on handling interpersonal conflicts. It’s fascinating how he draws lessons from the physical to the philosophical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the gymnastic exercises suppose that a man has torn thee with his nails, and by dashing against thy head has inflicted a wound. Well, we neither show any signs of vexation, nor are we offended, nor do we suspect him afterwards as a treacherous fellow; and yet we are on our guard against him, not however as an enemy, nor yet with suspicion, but we quietly get out of his way. Something like this let thy behaviour be in all the other parts of life: let us overlook many things in those who are like antagonists in the gymnasium. For it is in our power, as I said, to get out of the way, and to have no suspicion nor hatred.</p></blockquote>
<p>Imagine being in a gym where accidents happen—maybe a stray elbow here, a bump there. Aurelius notes that in these moments, we don’t hold grudges; we simply acknowledge the mishap as part of the process and remain vigilant without bearing ill will. He suggests taking this approach into our everyday lives, dealing with emotional and social bumps with the same nonchalance.
This got me thinking about how often we misinterpret others&rsquo; intentions. In the close quarters of life, just like in a gym, people might &lsquo;collide&rsquo; with us unintentionally. According to Aurelius, we should view these incidents as neutral events, not personal attacks.</p>
<p>He pushes for a stance of strategic engagement rather than avoidance. It’s about recognising potential conflicts and navigating them without emotional disturbance. This stoic advice isn’t about withdrawal but about maintaining inner peace by choosing how we react. By doing so, we avoid the negativity that can cloud our judgment and disturb our tranquility.</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius teaches us to face life&rsquo;s inevitable scuffles with resilience and forbearance, just as we would in a gym—no fuss, just moving forward with awareness and preparedness. It’s a lesson in understanding the nature of conflicts and the power of our responses.</p>

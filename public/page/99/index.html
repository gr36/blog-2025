  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The iPad lifestyle is almost a badge of honour now, a marketing angle, or some might think it a calling. However the be all and end all is the constant need to jump up and down and shout about it is getting a little draining.</p><p>If you need to spend a significant amount of money working in an iPad when a Mac would do it for free, I really question if you are working on an iPad at all. I choose an iPad because I had one, it was far better than carrying a laptop and got things done easier and quicker. It was a mobile device and as such kept much of the interaction paradigm I wanted from a mobile phone. I have been working on an iPad for more than 5 years, but it doesn’t mean anything to my identity in technology circles or indeed any other circles. I do not feel the need to mention it at every waking moment like some kind of mantra.</p><p>Not because I don’t care about working on an iPad, but because I don’t care what you do. Choose the device that works best for your stuff. I don’t think the argument or even commentary needs to be made. I work on an iPad, you might not, but I don’t need to make it my life’s work to convince you.</p><p>If someone has published a post about the iPad, there is little need to give it space in your brain, no need to comment on it for the next week. Write a link post or passive aggressive tweet. Why even be bothered by it? Leave it be.</p><p>Evangelism is for causes that need shouting about. Points that need arguing and debating with. The iPad is a computer, but I don’t give a dam what <em><em>you</em></em> do with it.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>For many weeks and months before WWDC I was worried. I had a fear for a piece of technology I have used for more than 5 years as my computer and it didn’t feel nice at all. My fears grew larger and larger the closer we got to the event, as leaks came out and people theorised what they wanted from the yearly software update cycle I hated it. I was really worried Apple were going to ruin my beloved iPad.</p>
<p>What makes the iPad so special to me is that it is first and foremost a mobile device. It is an extension of a simple OS, but one that is ridiculously powerful and evolving into a device to admire. I have been using an iPad every day since the iPad Air, and almost every update since has been transformative and made my life easier. Yet this year, more than any other, people were calling for a semi convergence – desktop class this and future of computing that, it all had me worried that the days of my iPad being my mobile computer were dying.</p>
<p>I couldn’t get excited for Springboard updates and multitasking overhauls because I could see a future in which iOS on the iPad was too complicated and at which point I would just go back to a Macbook. Everything that makes the iPad great is its roots in iOS, it’s touch first like the iPhone but powerful enough to take most of the heavy lifting of a macOS device without all the complexity that goes with it. Many people wanted all sorts of upgrades in iOS13 to make the iPad more of a computer but I was happy as it was, as I always had been.</p>
<p>I trusted Apple though. Trusted them to make the right decisions and land on a happy medium. I couldn’t get excited enough, or have the imagination to solve issues I pushed up against myself, but was confident that people smarter than myself knew what they were doing – and thankfully my trust was well founded.</p>
<p>With iOS13 my iPad Pro feels more like a computer than ever before, but still retains its iOS DNA. Sure Apple have renamed the operating system to iPadOS but this is in name only. It’s still a mobile operating system that almost everyone knows how to use, but by diversifying a little it’s now ok if swipes do different things. It’s acceptable for home screens and UI layouts to look different because its still quintessentially an iPad. It feels more computerish than ever but its the same device I fell in love with all those years ago. Bravo Apple.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>My wife often calls be “annoyingly positive” about everything, but that is not all I am. In fact some of my positive outlook and input is just for show, when in reality I am struggling. I know I really shouldn’t portray anything other than what I really feel, there is absolutely nothing wrong with not being ok. However I think a lot about the people around me and for one reason or another I don’t see why my internal mood should affect others around me.</p><p>I know from experience that my state of mind affects others around me to a huge extent. I react completely differently to very similar stimulus if I am struggling that day. I try not to let the <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/the-piggyback-guy/">piggy back guy</a> catch up with me most days, but even if I give in and let him ride every now and again, remembering a quote by Ram Dass usually gets me some of the way through.</p><blockquote>Be Like The Sun – Ram Dass</blockquote><p>I want to radiate to others my love and appreciation for them, even if they are testing me. I want to be like the sun and shine regardless of what the situation is, it shouldn’t matter if the clouds have gathered that day. The sun is always there, rising day after day. The natural thing when someone crosses you, or brings negativity into your life is to remove that sun shine. Remove the love and positivity and put that person in the shade for what they have done, but this only makes you both feel bad.</p><p>Be like the sun. Radiate out positivity regardless, and put no person or thing in the shade. Appreciate the challenge of overcoming the obstacle and make sure you still radiate, the sun manages to warm things even if something is in the way – so smile through it and it might just change everyone’s day.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Did I ever mention how much I like writing in Bear? Pretty sure I did, but this latest update was possibly the best timing ever, it allows me to publish new blog posts really easy to WordPress.</p>
<h2 id="text-bundle"><strong><strong>Text Bundle</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The ‘magic’ behind this is exporting in text bundle. The updated app now exports plain text with attached images, and combines with the WordPress app to make sure the post shows correctly. In fact the Bear team built a whole <a href="https://github.com/shinyfrog/TextBundle">open source library for processing</a> so other apps could to the same in the future – as Shiney Frog point out open standards for sharing files <a href="https://blog.bear.app/2018/05/the-who-what-and-why-of-bear/">make them happy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to"><strong><strong>How To</strong></strong></h2>
<p>With today’s update to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880">WordPress for iOS</a> , you can now publish Bear notes to WordPress blogs. It’s really simple to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, make sure you update <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447">Bear</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880">WordPress</a></li>
<li>In Bear, tap the share sheet at the top right of a note</li>
<li>Tap WordPress in the top row of options (learn <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/install-app-extensions-iph1750a2241/ios">how to enable app extensions on iOS</a> )</li>
<li>The WordPress app will open. If you have multiple blogs, a screen will appear so you can pick one as your post’s destination</li>
<li>A draft screen will appear with your post filled in, complete with proper formatting of all headings, links, text styles, lists, and even photos</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: To give your blog post a title, make sure your Bear note begins with an H1 header tag.</p>
<p>There are a couple of major disadvantages to this set up. You must either have your blog hosted on WordPress web hosting or have the JetPack plugin installed. I have tried to find a way around this with my external site but it simply doesn’t pick up my site unless it is installed and activated.</p>
<p>Also there is no facility to add a featured image like other apps. For example Ulysses automatically sets the attached image as the featured image and this isn’t the case with Bear. You can of cause hop straight into the WordPress app and set this very easily.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Sharing previews are yet another thing missing from WordPress which should really be included by now. It’s dead easy to <a href="https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">install a plugin</a> and have it all done for you, but why bother with slowing down your site with needless plugins when you can add a tiny bit of code to your functions file.</p>
<pre><code>//Add Twitter Cards Meta Info
function add_twitter_card_info() {
 global $post;
 if ( !is_singular())
 return;
 echo ‘’;
 echo ‘’;
 echo ‘’;
 echo ‘’;
 echo ‘’; //optional: username of website
 echo ‘’; //optional: username of content creator
 if(!has_post_thumbnail( $post-&gt;ID )) { //use a default image if no featured image set
 $default_image=“http://example.com/image.jpg”; //replace this with a default image
 echo ‘’;
 }
 else{
 $thumbnail_src = wp_get_attachment_image_src( get_post_thumbnail_id( $post-&gt;ID ), ‘medium’ );
 echo ‘’;
 }
 echo “n”;
}
add_action( ‘wp_head’, ‘add_twitter_card_info’);
</code></pre>
<p>Simply paste in the above code to the functions.php file in your WordPress theme and validate all has gone correctly using the <a href="https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator">Card Validator</a>.</p>

<p>In my journey back to WordPress, there are lots of little modifications I need to make the website my own. One of which is the addition of micro and link posts.</p>
<p>I do not like all posts showing in the main RSS feed nor on the main index page of my blog. Many options and guides tell you to install plugins or add in code to your functions to exclude categories to all feeds. If you can avoid a plugin, then I would advise it, to prevent any unnecessary loading of your blog.</p>
<p>I did stumble on a solution to my requirements on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12918765/exclude-category-from-main-rss-feed-but-not-all-feeds">Stack Overflow</a> (where else), and this is detailed below.</p>
<pre>add_action(‘pre_get_posts’, ‘exclude_category’ ); function exclude_category( &amp;$wp_query ) // Exclude from loop, archive and feed but not from category page/feed { if( is_home() || ( is_feed() &amp;&amp; !is_category() ) || ( is_archive() &amp;&amp; !is_category() )) { // Exclude from home, feed, but not from category page/feed set_query_var(‘category__not_in’, array(120)); // Exclude category with ID 120 } }</pre>
<pre>Add this to your themes functions.php file and remember to change the (‘category__not_in’, array(120)</pre>
<p>to your desired category ID , if you need help finding that, check out <a href="https://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/find-wordpress-category-id/">this guide</a>.</p>

      <p>For the whole of this weekend, I turned my phone off. Not because it was bothering me, not because I was doing something important, but simply because I wanted to – and the world became a much quieter place.</p><p>I became fascinated by the silence that filled the gaps between us talking as a family, almost as if I didn’t want to spoil them. They became essential to me, they spoke to me, and I could feel what the silences were there to convey by just listening to them. Yes, I realise that sounds obscure, and I have re-written this post quite a few times already.</p><blockquote>We are fascinated by the words, but where we meet is in the silence behind them — Ram Dass</blockquote><p>Silence often fills us full of dread; when people are around us, silence becomes something to be avoided and talked over. Silence is a hugely important part of speech and conversation. It portrays emotion almost as much as the sounds in-between it, and when left alone, pulls more out of whoever chooses to break it.</p><p>It becomes far more critical when I am not in front of the person talking to me. When consuming audiobooks and podcasts, the spaces of silence are a crucial attribute. It has become the norm to listen to podcasts at obscene speeds and even get the app to remove silence as if it is something to be avoided. It is treated as dead ‘air time’ that serves no purpose, and thankfully I will never edit it out of my own.</p><p>Breaking the silence of a room should become a choice; the reason for speaking is more important than the enjoyment of the quietness. Don’t speak because you are uncomfortable with the silence, become comfortable with the quiet instead.</p>

<p>For the first 30 years of my life, I thought I was different from everyone else. I felt that my shifts in mood and outlook on life were abnormal and no one else felt like I did. I seemed strange to me that my happiness and motivation through the daily grind of life was more like a rollercoaster than it really should be. Wasn’t until the last few years that I learnt that everyone is the same, and these changes are what makes life so fulfilling.</p>
<p>Imagine a video game, how rubbish would it be if every level was easy to complete. You might start playing and enjoy it at first, but very soon the boredom would set in as the rewards became less fulfilling. Overcoming increases in difficulty and learning new skills because it keeps you hooked, and once you beat that last level the reward feels so much sweeter than if it were a walk in the park.</p>
<blockquote><p>if you know the way broadly you will see it in all things – Miyamoto Musashi</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, getting that balance right is critical, cranking up the difficulty level at just the right times and places is vital. Too steep a jump and it becomes too much, and you’re likely to quit. However how more likely are you to stop than the straightforward version? The easy way out seems much more appealing but leaves a slightly hollow feeling.</p>
<p>As friends and family members go through their struggle with mental health the most abundant response is that of medication. Prescribing a pill that takes the world and blunts the sharp ends for you. Removes the stresses to a level that you don’t care. Making an average life filled with days that are all different when graded from 1-10, and makes them all a 5. I’m never convinced this is the best resolution, when just understanding their feelings are healthy may be the most straightforward option.</p>
<p>I am not advocating that people shouldn’t take medication that is needed, and please don’t take this as a post to try and say that. When prescribed a drug it is vital you take it, but the self-medication is far more dangerous. This may be with drugs or alcohol, but it may be simply removing yourself from the world. Shying away every time your life is tough and just not exposing yourself to the daily stresses and strains that make you stronger. Escaping the world when it gets too harsh, or painting a different outcome on social media is a far more dangerous way of evening out the world.</p>
<p>Creating my struggle is now something that I embrace and even welcome once it comes. When I’m struggling through hard times in the gym, or life, it makes the better times much better. I know the outcome I want to achieve and remember the fact that I have been there before to experience this wave breaking. Comfortable in the knowledge that I have learnt more from the days that we’re closer to breaking than those pitched in the middle. I thought at times my whole world had ended, but now look back and smile because I came through.</p>
<p>I can’t imagine a world that is made up I only 5s; it sounds like the most boring life in the world.</p>

<p>I’ve had this post in my drafts for a long time because from both an internal and an external perspective it is something that bothers me tremendously. I have rewritten it so many times to try and avoid the negativity, and I hope this comes across in the right way.</p>
<p>More than a few times in my life I have fallen foul of letting my ego get the better of me, this hasn’t been lately but indeed is something I catch myself doing. Unfortunately, I am not alone, and social media seems to support these ego expansions, and you receive little push back.</p>
<p>Time and time again I see the over inflation of ego because they receive a little notoriety, receive a few followers that fluff this up and very quickly it gets out of control. They begin to forget the people that are around them and are removed to place they look down.</p>
<p>As I said before, this has happened to me, <a href="https://gr36.me/2019/02/08/132521.html">on a much smaller scale</a>, but I see it more as we are more connected. When I think back to the person I was even a few years ago, I would have never written a post such as this, but I am confident now that I have learnt many lessons to pass them on.</p>
<p>The ego is such a dangerous part of our consciousness that it seems to work against us as a person and as a community. Don’t let it take over you and remember who you are, what you stand for and everything you wish to be. From experience we should all try and remember that our opinions do not matter more than others; you can learn from each one of your interactions, and be humble at all times.</p>

<p>You might be wondering this, or you may not care (or even noticed) but I have been very absent from my usual haunts recently. This is partly by choice, and partly due to other reasons. I am, well I think I was, burnt out – but during my break away I have realised that the things I thought were important to me as a person, actually are not.</p>
<p>I came to a huge realisation. I thought it was social media that I loved, but I hate it. It’s the conversations I like, and they are becoming less and less. No one knows how to have a discussion any longer, and the technology circles I used to move in are no longer attractive. Interaction has died both back to my posts, and also from my end. I just can’t be bothered to respond because of passive aggressiveness or merely being ignored.</p>
<p>Quite frankly I feel it is no longer worth my time. That is not to say that engaging with my followers is no longer worthwhile; I’m not that arrogant. It is that time put in no longer equals value out, and at many points, it is detracting from my life and mental wellbeing. Lots of the people I looked up to as inspiration and motivation are not the types of person I want to be. I’m not interested in building a brand for myself, I want to be able to be myself, and that doesn’t revolve around the things it used to.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of my working life now designing, writing and working on things I used to be in my spare time. So when home time comes, I want to do different things. I feel like a different person now, with different desires, different motivations and a new outlook to life. I feel as though I’ve gone to a different stage in my life, so if in any doubt – that’s where I am.</p>

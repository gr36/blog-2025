     <p>Finally launching with iOS 17.2 <a href="/2023/10/27/new-journalling-app.html">Apple’s new journal app</a> immediately received criticism. Whilst some of it was valid, most of this focused on features Apple did not promise. It delivered a very barebones app that gives me the impression it was for nothing more than showing off the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/tech-talks/111384/">Journaling API</a>. <em>My</em> thoughts are a lot more positive, and I thought I would run through how I use it.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/c4468f7f07.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>I have been journalling on and off for a while, but only really got <a href="/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html">serious in January</a> 2023. Adopting Day One to type out morning pages and other entries pretty religiously. Due to my short relationship to journalling apps, some may claim this restricts the validity of my opinions. I’m not on a <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/streak-story-bryce-evans/">two thousand day streak</a> or anything, but I will leave the level of authority I write with up to you.</p>
<h2 id="powerfullysimple">Powerfully Simple</h2>
<p>The reality is, the iOS Journal app is absolutely fine. It’s not as complex as some on the market, but I think that is the biggest positive. As much as I like using Day One, Apples app is actually a much better option for most people. It removes all the things that power users <em>may</em> need, like tagging and multiple journals, but replaces it with a much simpler experience.</p>
<p>In many ways, it reflects Apple’s user interface design perfectly. Removing as much complexity as possible to “tap thing, do action”. There are some great prompts and selections to fuel the content of your entires, from the aforementioned API, but all you need to do is tap the plus sign and start writing.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/45f716c7ff.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>This wonderfully simple interface makes me want to save more things. Record ideas, things I have done, and a lot more. There is no worrying about what journal to put it in, or styling to mess about with, just saving numerous things effortlessly. As you can see from my screenshots, I’ve taken to adding thoughts on how my training runs have gone, some podcast notes and even some blog post ideas — all in one place.</p>
<p>The app is not perfect, there’s no Mac or iPad app to start with. You could achieve the same result by simplifying Day One, as it <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/introducing-journaling-suggestions/">also has access to the new Journalling suggestions</a>, found by starting a new post and tapping the magic wand icon. I, personally, don’t need all the extra bits that Day One offers, so I can remove <em>another</em> cost from my subscriptions and still get all the benefits of journalling. If I can <a href="/2023/12/19/the-unremarkable-chronicles.html">work out what to write</a>!</p>

    <h1 class="p-name">My Handwriting Can’t Keep Up</h1>
</a>
 
<div class="datetime" style="font-size: 70%">

    <time datetime="2023-12-20 07:42:16 &#43;0000">20 Dec 2023</time>
  </div>
  </div>
<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>For years, I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out why my handwriting is so bad. Seriously, it&rsquo;s like what you&rsquo;d expect from a three-year-old. I often blame my years in higher education – anyone who&rsquo;s been through it knows that, unless you really put in the effort, your handwriting just stagnates after school. Everything has to be typed up neatly before submission, making pen and paper seem redundant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m digressing a bit, but that&rsquo;s usually my go-to explanation when, much to my dismay, someone catches a glimpse of my writing. This issue really came to the forefront recently when I had to write out some Christmas cards, a task I normally leave to my wife, who has flawless handwriting. Confronted with the task of writing on the cards, I was appalled at the mess I&rsquo;d made.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s odd is my fondness for jotting notes in a physical notebook. The brief notes and thoughts I jot down often require some deciphering, but it&rsquo;s when I have to write at length that my handwriting really deteriorates. Whenever I write morning pages, I choose to type them, contrary to popular advice to write them manually. I attribute this to my ability to type quickly enough to keep up with my thoughts, a realisation that recently struck me as the real issue.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/41673fd9c0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Before I started using Day One <a href="/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html">in January last year</a>, I watched every review and setup video available. Many emphasised the speed of typing over handwriting, and I agreed. My hand couldn&rsquo;t match the pace of my thoughts, which I saw as a drawback. So, I decided to subscribe and type instead of writing by hand. In reality, I didn&rsquo;t need to speed up my writing to match my thoughts; instead, I needed to slow my thoughts to match my writing pace.</p>
<p>This shift transformed an already effective practice for the better. My hand stopped cramping, and my words became clearer as I stopped rushing. Most importantly, I slowed my thought process to match my handwriting pace, allowing me to maintain and focus on my thoughts longer. In my haste to express and release them, I hadn&rsquo;t been giving them the necessary space. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still <a href="/2023/12/19/the-unremarkable-chronicles.html">struggle with what to write half the time</a>, but now, I relish the process of slowly and thoughtfully putting pen to paper.</p>

     <p>I have tried. I have really tried to make this bloody journaling thing work. Unfortunately, I have no choice but to throw in the towel because I am genuinely stuck. If you&rsquo;re relying on prompts from the new journal API to spice up your daily entries, like I am, you to might hit a snag if your life is as uneventful as mine tends to be.</p>
<p>My mornings kick off religiously at 6am. It&rsquo;s a straightforward routine: get everything ready for Lucie&rsquo;s school departure a bit past 7, enjoy a solitary coffee, then play chauffeur for my wife to take her to work. Once back home, I&rsquo;m hunkered down in my home office, with film soundtracks as my loyal companions. Sounds like a script for a riveting blockbuster, right? Not exactly.</p>
<p>Sure, there are occasional deviations from the script. I go running, and sprinkle in the occasional podcasts. But really, what grand tales are there to narrate in a journal? It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m scaling mountains or traversing exotic jungles. What do you write about when your life doesn’t venture beyond the ordinary? Definitely not more navel-gazing or empty promises of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write more journal entries. I really super-duper promise this time”.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4243e890ac.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my very ordinariness that poses such a challenge to me. I realise that I am comparing <a href="/2021/05/31/insides-vs-outsides.html">my insides to other people&rsquo;s outsides</a> when I look for inspiration online. Yet still wonder how to make the mundane interesting? This also bleeds into my photography, I don’t go anywhere, nor do anything, intriguing. How do I find stories worth telling in a day that unfolds with the predictability of a sitcom rerun?</p>
<p>I don’t struggle for ideas for blog posts because they often abstract. Not born from my boring existence, created from a mind that wanders further than my feet. I can’t tell tales of my existence because there are none to tell. Don’t get me wrong, I am content with the predictability of my regular life, after all, not every day needs to be a headline-worthy adventure. I just long for some narrative to tell from within the folds of the everyday.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>In today&rsquo;s fast-paced world, the concept of &lsquo;hustle culture&rsquo; and the proliferation of productivity-focused videos on platforms like YouTube have become the norm. The underlying message in this sea of content is clear: to earn more, to achieve a higher status, and ultimately, to be &ldquo;successful”. This chase for success is often equated with a promise of increased happiness and a more fulfilling life. But is this relentless pursuit really the key to happiness?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that numerous studies have shown that while money can indeed <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/why-money-cant-buy-you-happiness">contribute to happiness</a>, it only does so up to a certain point. Beyond that, the correlation between <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/wealth/what-worlds-longest-happiness-study-says-about-money-2023-02-06/">wealth and happiness starts to fade</a>. This brings us to an intriguing thought – why not skip the middleman? Why immerse ourselves in a constant state of hustle and stress in the quest for happiness, when we could potentially find contentment in what we already have?</p>
<p>From my perspective, sitting in a comfortable home, surrounded by a loving family, and with a job I enjoy, it might be easy to preach contentment. I recognise that I speak from a position of relative privilege. However, the essence of my argument transcends material comforts. Happiness, as I see it, is not a distant goal to be reached. Rather, it&rsquo;s a mindset, a way of viewing and engaging with the world around us.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t to dismiss the value of ambition or the desire to improve one&rsquo;s circumstances. Striving for better is a natural and healthy aspect of human nature. However, when this striving becomes an endless cycle of wanting more, it can lead to a perpetual state of dissatisfaction. We begin to place our happiness in a future that&rsquo;s always just out of reach, constantly moving the goalposts as soon as we achieve our latest objective.</p>
<p>So, while there&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with seeking success or improvement, it&rsquo;s crucial to balance these ambitions with an appreciation for the present. It&rsquo;s about finding joy in the journey, not just the destination. This balance is perhaps the true key to a happy, fulfilled life – a life where we strive for better, but also take the time to appreciate and find joy in where we are right now.</p>

     <p>For a few years I have been <a href="/2021/02/18/whats-essential-to.html">banging on about the indie web</a>, <a href="/2021/02/18/webmentions-to-avoid.html">webmention</a> and <a href="/2023/07/10/openness-is-the.html">Activitypub</a>. Since moving to micro.blog in 2018, these principles at first went over my head and are now what I believe the web should be built on. These thoughts are not exclusively mine, but in the last few months, plenty of people have begun to share this belief since the downfall of Twitter. Although there have been strides to move in this direction, the abundance of new social networks have increased my desire to just post in one place.</p>
<p>The new social network on the block is Threads, and despite all my distain for attention seeking, fast-paced social networks, particularly one run by Meta, I actually enjoy using it. Most of the people that I haven’t been keeping up with for the past 18 months because they stayed on Twitter have taken up space there. Despite hating the service, I feel like I have a lot of my friends back. Very apt that I would round this post off today, but I loved it until very recently.</p>
<p>Whilst writing a blog post, I wanted to link to a post I had made, but couldn’t remember where I had posted it to. After a not insignificant amount of time, I found it on Mastodon, but before I moved to micro.blog for everything and the epiphany hit. Much like my <a href="/2023/11/04/posse-is-too.html">ramblings on POSSE</a> and the amount of work it needs, spreading myself over several networks is absolutely not a position I want to be in either.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it does <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C0zXcQmxO77">look as if</a> ActivityPub integration on Threads is finally coming, and I can follow all my friends again. For now though, and what was always the plan anyway, I will continue to post to my blog. I can read, reply and interact with everything I need to hear, it’s just easier. You can find me anywhere ActivityPub is <code>@greg@gr36.com</code>.</p>

     <p>When I <a href="/2018/05/25/youxre-not-cool.html">first moved to micro.blog</a> I had this dream that I would be able to write and publish freely. By removing the worry about what to post where and how it looked <em>should</em> have released more posts into the world. No stress from separating what goes on my blog and what goes on social media. By publishing whatever I wanted, however I wanted, I freed myself up to do more. Yet here I am years later, still trying to have a ‘proper blog’.</p>
<p>I still sit down with an idea, or two, looking to flesh it out and hit a magic 300 word mark where I start to think it might be publishable. Someone put this limit in my head years ago, possibly for SEO on a proper blog, and since then, I have always stuck to it. Titled properly, with an image for the rich link previews. Then and only then could I even <em>think</em> about it going live.</p>
<p>When the reality is, none of this matters. The way I, or anyone, formats their blog posts means exactly nothing. In fact, in some weird <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270844183_The_Red_Sneakers_Effect_Inferring_Status_and_Competence_from_Signals_of_Nonconformity#:~:text=A%20series%20of%20studies%20demonstrates,for%20uniqueness%20in%20the%20observers.">Red Sneaker Effect attempts</a>, numerous publications are trying new things and evolving the way posts are structured. Yet here I am, asking ChatGPT to make me an image and worrying about these limits <strong>that I impose on myself</strong>.</p>
<p>I went so far before as hiding away my shorter posts from my home pages, but now show them along with everything else. I will continue to exclude these in the main RSS feed, and I do think that a lot of my ideas need to be developed and fleshed out to see if they even make sense. As <a href="/2023/12/06/my-words-when.html">I discussed before,</a> I use this process as personal development, but that doesn’t mean I can’t hit publish.</p>
<div class="callout pink_callout">
🤦🏻‍♂️ The entirety of this post that I have been talking to myself about publishing more things, I have still been looking at the word counter and making sure it gets up high enough - but I didn't include an image. It's a start.

     <p>This past April, I hit a bit of a snag with my journaling. I had this <a href="/2023/02/11/do-i-even.html">idea in my head</a> that I&rsquo;d be one of those people with a <a href="/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html">notebook always at hand</a>, filled with insightful notes and daily reflections. Ready to write the best blog posts you’ve ever read — but the truth is, it wasn&rsquo;t working out like that. I went on holiday this summer and didn&rsquo;t miss scribbling in my notebook, which made me stop and think.</p>
<p>There was <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">a time around last Christmas</a> when I was really into it. I had convinced myself that this daily writing was the key to my happiness. But after a while, I realised that it wasn&rsquo;t the act of writing that made me happy; it was me figuring out things for myself. Sure, the people and things I care about (like my family) can give me a boost, but at the end of the day, my happiness is up to me.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/62011d1bd4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about writing by hand that feels right to me, even though it&rsquo;s slower than typing, and you can&rsquo;t just hit &lsquo;search&rsquo; to find something you wrote. But for some reason, I just stopped using my notebook for a few months. It&rsquo;s like it went into hibernation or something. Eventually, it just stopped being a part of my routine, and by the time summer came around, I had stopped using it altogether.</p>
<p>One has always been close by, but just sitting and waiting for me to pick it back up again. I had the occasional flick through it to find an idea or a quote I remember writing down, but always placing it back down again with a promise to start using it once more. Perhaps that day is today. Well, the past week or so, actually. I drew a line under everything, metaphorically and physically. I&rsquo;ve got a new notebook now, and I&rsquo;m ready to give it another shot.</p>
<p>Notebooks might come and go, but I&rsquo;m sticking with it.</p>

     <p>Can I come straight out and say it? I love reading, and books are my favourite. That gets all the disclaimers out of the way and makes my probable bias obvious right from the start. However, there is something about reading books that not only entertains me but means I learn more along the way, and the web will never replace that.</p>
<p>Books receive a lot of criticism. Even perceived intellectuals, like the now-disgraced crypto guru SBF, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/29/sam-bankman-fried-reading-effective-altruism/">fail to see the value in books</a>. They are denounced as “too slow” or not “entertaining enough” by a range of people who seem to think information should be mainlined into their veins. There is more to reading a book specifically that many people seem to miss - and <a href="/2022/04/10/reading-doesnxt-need.html">reading doesn’t need to be hacked</a>!</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7ce720a7ca.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The entire experience of touching and turning pages might seem redundant, but that tactile chore is the very point. Research by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227608869_Hypertext_fiction_reading_Haptics_and_immersion">Anne Mangen has shown</a> a crucial link between the sensory and motor experience of reading a physical book. It draws not just on our sense of sight but also on our sense of touch, changing the depth of attention paid to words on a page compared to words on a screen.</p>
<p>My personal ranting about <a href="/2023/06/29/find-the-what.html">books that should have been blog posts</a> does hide my enjoyment of reading them. There is something enjoyable about taking in someone’s prose that goes around the houses a bit and reinforces their ideas with real-life examples. While straight-to-the-point blog posts, like the one you’re reading now, have their place, there is joy in the ramble. The slow pulling back of the curtain to reveal new ideas, rather than a yanking of the cover and pointing, is delightful.</p>
<p>I am reminded of the habit all students get into of relying on Cliffnotes for books they&rsquo;re supposed to read. Shoving the information straight into my brain instead of the steady drip from long text never worked. Nowadays, there are several companies out there summarising books and even films so you can act as if you consumed the content without actually doing the work. All of which achieve results, but lack that something special.</p>
<p>Much like my <a href="/2019/04/29/skipping-silence.html">enjoyment of the pauses in podcasts</a>, I think this comes from my tendency to <a href="/2023/09/09/i-enjoy-being.html">enjoy being slow</a>, but I find taking the time to read a book. A ‘real’ book if I can, adds so much to the enjoyment.</p>

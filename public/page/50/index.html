      <p>It doesn’t take a lot to see how frustrating some people can be. Here I was in a happy little bubble and thinking the world was getting better and twitter was an OK place to be again.. and then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/08/doctor-who-ncuti-gatwas-irrepressible-rise-to-new-time-lord">Doctor Who was announced as a Black man</a></p>
<p>I am still not convinced that most of the outrage and general bigoted tweets are real. Much like flat earth, I think there is an in-joke I just don’t get. Or perhaps this is my minds defence mechanism for convincing myself that the world really isn’t as bad as it seems? This is all got to be just for attention, or internet points or something right?</p>
<p>Anyway, my good mood continues, but perhaps my positiveness towards social media does not.</p>

      <p>About an hour ago, I decided I was going to sign up for a year of micro.blog and <a href="https://twitter.com/gr36/status/1519652342257303552?s=21&amp;t=F3PIAUwtfLJcUg4EdriRsg">start sharing more things</a>. I’d just finished the 7th day straight on using our home cross trainer as part of our <a href="https://twitter.com/gr36/status/1519995151191613440?s=21&amp;t=F3PIAUwtfLJcUg4EdriRsg">monthly challenge</a> and wanted to write something. These kinds of posts would really fit into my blog, and decided somewhere else might be better—but then it hit me just how stupid that was.</p>
<p>What exactly was I wanting to write a post for? To show how great I am, but not let it interfere with this illusion that my blog is somehow professional? I have no idea, to be honest.</p>
<p>But then again, I have no idea why I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/scared-of-stopping-sharing/">share so much stuff already</a>, and indeed want to share more. Perhaps I have let the ego in too much, and it wants some praise for a task I am doing just for a bit of fun with my wife?</p>
<p>She’s still convinced she’s going to win, by the way! Never going to happen.</p>

      <p>I recorded another episode of <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/">my podcast</a> last night, and the guest gave me such an inspiring speech that I almost wanted to release the episode straight away. I won’t, for fear of all the coughing and dad jokes (it will follow soon enough) but the words are still ringing in my head.</p><p>How you master your craft is to just get on and do it. We spoke specifically about writing and all the crap that goes on around it, but it could easily be applicable to any other art form you choose. You simply can’t become good at something without practicing and just keeping your head down and moving forward.</p><p>A while ago, I came to the realisation that there are no shortcuts to being a good photographer. Much like <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/sitting-in-the/">sitting in the chair</a>, you just need to get out and take photos. You don’t need fancy glass, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/you-probably-dont-need-a-new-thing/">a new camera</a> or anything else. It doesn’t matter where you share the images, pick <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/glass-feelings/">Glass</a>, or <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-glass-half-full/">Instagram</a>, or send them out my email if it suits you. If you want to take good pictures, you have to take pictures, and lots of them.</p><p>In writing terms, it simply doesn’t matter what blogging platform you use, what newsletter you decide to do, nor what computer you choose to do it on. If that is what you aim to do, and be good at it, you just need to keep on doing it. Consistently. Constantly, and not worry about anything else. If this doesn’t sound appealing to you, perhaps whatever it is that you are trying to do isn’t that important to you after all.</p><p>Spending money doesn’t make you good at something. The equipment you use doesn’t make you good at something. The way you look doesn’t make you good at something. Only you make you good at something, and it’s time to get on and do it.</p>

      <p>Trying to form my desires and intentions for sharing online is hard. There are a few things I want to do, and a few more I would like to do but probably won’t and then a few more that I would like to cut out.</p><p>The motivation to put my ducks and a row is not prompted by Elon, but when others are <a href="https://mph.puddingbowl.org/2022/04/29/232402.html">doing and writing about </a>the same thing currently, it could well be a slight motivating factor.</p><p>I haven’t formed any opinion on the Twitter thing, partly because I don’t really care. I am lucky in the sense that I haven’t experienced any of the issues that <em>may</em>increase with a less carefully approach. However, I can’t get emotional about something that hasn’t changed (yet) and I may <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/twitter-muscle-memory/">struggle to give up my beloved Twitter </a>if anything ever did.</p><p>My sharing online was at a point not too long ago where I almost <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/scared-of-stopping-sharing/">walked away entirely.</a> I have absolutely no idea why I continue to share what I do, why I feel the need to tweet many things, and have given up trying to work it out. I have not got to the stage where <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/matt-birchler/">my brain thinks in 280 characters</a>, but I am not far away from a life like this.</p><p>There is no doubt in my mind that Twitter affects my concentration and my attention span. Yet, even knowing this, there would have to be something pretty dramatic to stop me from using it. Sure I can be intentional about its usage, I do limit myself a little and still stay engaged with life, but until Elon burns it down I will still keep coming back.</p><p>Twitter has given me so much positive in my life, it may never reach a net negative. Meeting people, finding out things and providing comfort when I need it most keep me coming back time and time again, and I don’t see that ever-changing.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The app's first words to me about Spaces were “What the #$@!% is that” and I entirely agree. I hate that little icon that plagues my Twitter app screen. I think it’s supposed to be a microphone, but I vaguely remember it being something different. The powers that be at Twitter have decided to leave it with me with no option of removing it, but my opinions are changing.</p><p>Last night, myself and <a href="https://twitter.com/iamJeffPerry">Jeff Perry</a> decided to set up a Twitter space and <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1DXxyDXjkvRJM?s=20">have a chat about tech</a>. There’s no messing about, no need for microphones, or a recording set up at all. All you require is a phone and away you go, and there is something really freeing about that.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I enjoyed this chat and it was really easy to set up. I’m sold on the Spaces idea now. <a href="https://t.co/AC0lBB3TRl">https://t.co/AC0lBB3TRl</a></p>— Greg Morris (@GR36) <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1520669229384704000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2022</a></blockquote> <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Of course, if you’ve been into voice first social media, this is all old news. Services like <a href="https://www.clubhouse.com">Club House</a> have been providing spaces for people to chat for a couple of years already. Proving that there is a desire for people to use their voice rather than type out words and also help remove some of the nuance that 280 characters often provides.</p><p>The ease of use and the tools that Twitter Spaces provides has proven to me the usefulness of the service with just one try. Closed captions, visual indication of listers, sharing links you discuss into the chat – all of <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces">these features</a> that are only obvious once you use it, make it a well-rounded feature after all. I do still wish they wouldn’t keep ramming it down our throats.</p><p>Like they did with <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/introducing-fleets-new-way-to-join-the-conversation">Fleets</a>, the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/goodbye-fleets">not long for this world</a> disappearing version of tweets, Twitter uses its app to leverage adoption of new features. Often annoying users to the point they give up, or switch to a third-party app to avoid the nonsense. The icon is one thing, but I have found a big blue bubble <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1519354301432406016?s=20&amp;t=1leQDxPuqgBXMI1y2HIXeA">attached to the top of my home screen</a> more times than I care to mention, simply because someone I follow is listening to a live Space. With no option to hide it I have listened in to some of them, but never really have the time to stay for long.</p><p>I would guess most people won’t either. Twitter is small tweets while you’re doing something, and unless it is something I really want to take in live, I rarely have the time to stop and listen if I catch one ad-hoc. Which makes Twitter Spaces a confusing proposition. All the shenanigans put me off initially, I can see the value in the service with ease of use, but ultimately am not convinced Twitter is the place for it.</p>

      <p>Eric Migicovsky on <a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/why-pebble-failed-d7be937c6232">Why Pebble failed</a>:</p><blockquote>Looking back with hindsight, I should not have aggressively grown the company without a stronger plan. We should have just stuck to what we knew best and continued to build quirky, fun smartwatches for hackers.</blockquote><p>There is a lot to take way from this article, so I will keep it brief, but it’s rare to see a founder admit the mistakes made and especially so publicly. I love Pebble, it was the first smartwatch I truly used and was the first and only time I helped found something on Kickstarter (RIP my red founders edition).</p><p>Despite its relative success between nerds, you’d be hard pushed to find an average person who knows what a Pebble watch was, and this is part of the failure.</p><blockquote>Around this time Apple came out with the Apple Watch and we thought the smartwatch market was about to explode. So in a quest for big sales growth, we figured our 2015 strategy would need to shift focus to a broader market, away from our core early adopter market positioning.</blockquote><p>It’s reasonable to expect boom time once Apple got involve, however instead of appealing to the crowd they had already made they tried to appeal to more people. Instead of remaining true to their hacker nature, they pumped money into features and tried to become mainstream. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but I wonder if, at a time that even the Apple Watch didn’t know what it was, Pebble could have carved out a place in the heart of users that wanted something hackable.</p><p>However, we can but dream. I am not certain that Pebble would still be alive today. They would have undoubtably been swallowed up by a bigger company, but it would have been great to see what they could have achieved with another few years under their belt. As great as seeking investors can be for boosting a business, the constant need to see return and strive to be a success is dangerous.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I woke to an email about an ancient <a href="https://github.com/gr36/Shortcuts">Shortcuts repo</a> I had stored old backup files in. They were available as a place to save Shortcut files I had written about because the iCloud link sharing can be a bit flaky. They were so old it contained loads of .wflow files and I had forgotten it even existed, but they now need to be signed to work with iOS15.</p>
<p>Of course, I felt no need to update these, but thought it should be pretty simple, so tried to get them updated anyway. Unfortunately, I was wrong and the lack of detail in how to do this is pretty poor, but with a bit of trial and error I got them signed without issue – I hope.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>You will need a Mac to do this. It is the only way I have found to reliably get everything signed using the command line. Some information online suggest that it can be done on iOS using SSH, but I couldn’t get <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/pich0y/shortcut_source_helper_helper_for_shortcut_plist/">this to work</a>, and it felt very fiddly.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/714b9d8669.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>So to use <em>this</em> guide, you will need a Mac running macOS Monterey and be able to use the terminal app on your device.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-sign-the-shortcut">How To Sign The Shortcut</h2>
<p>Open terminal on your Mac, and cd into the folder containing the shortcut files. Use the following command to sign the shortcut file:</p>
<pre><code>shortcuts sign -i a.wflow -o b.wflow</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>a.wflow</code> is the name of the shortcuts file, and <code>b.wflow</code> is the name you want the signed Shortcuts file to be called. Due to the weirdness in names, I actually found it easier to rename my source file as ‘a’ and then rename ‘b’ to whatever I wanted it to become.</p>
<p>Who knows if Apple will change the requirement yet again, but for the time being, you will now be able to load the file into shortcuts on Mac or iOS without issue, as the new file is now signed.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Although there are a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqKkn7kpvto&t=931s">few people</a> who sometimes use a longer lens for Street Photography, there are far more that dismiss a longer focal length. The internet is filled with posts telling you to buy a 28mm, or a 35mm or at most a 50mm lens. Sure they are all good options (who doesn’t like a nifty 50) but it doesn’t have to be that way.</p><p>The fact I don’t have to stand so close to people is the one over arching thing that makes a longer length so great. When you’re just starting out, or <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/lincoln-street-photography/">still learning like I am</a>, a 85mm length is great. Allowing you to get the up close and personal shots that make street photography so great, but not have to deal with the people that go with it.</p>
<img src="uploads/2024/2f09c7cb46.jpg">
<p>Some of this is confidence, I have absolutely no motivation to go up to someone and ask them if it's OK, nor would I ever point my camera at someone right in front of me and a longer focal length means I am less likely to have to. When some photographers talk about the candidness of a tiny little lens, I get the same feeling with my 85mm f/1.8 Sony lens. Taking pictures becomes easy and worry free.</p>
<p>
Typically, photographers think a 50mm lens would be smaller too, but not any more. If I wanted to keep a fast lens in 50mm I would be lugging around the SEL50F12GM at 778g (not to mention the £2,099 price tag), or loose around a stop of light on the SEL50F25G at a fantastic 174 g. Whereas the SEL85F18 I have strikes a great balance at 371g and a very affordable £400.</p>
<img src="uploads/2024/5a338c2342.jpg">
<p>Using my A7c and a 85mm prime is the perfect combination of nice and light with enough ability to capture the shots I really want and be a little more removed from the subjects. This may change with confidence and progression, but let it be said that you simply do not need to buy some expensive glass nor stand really close to people to get great shots. I love 85mm for almost everything, and you might too.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There are far too many things in my life that I don’t really need. I don’t need half the technology I have, nor most of the myriad of online services that I pay for. These include the hosting for my blog. I don’t need it really, but it serves a purpose deeper than the small amount it costs me each month and gives me tremendous value anyway.</p><p>My blog has been up for more than a decade (the earliest post I still have is from 2014) and it has been through numerous changes. The most recent of which was an <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-new-home/">investment in the new domain</a> last year, but the hours poured into it outweighs the monetary costs significantly.</p><p>My blog has been many things over the years, attempted portfolios, business ventures and had any number of facelifts but still mainly provides an outlet for me. In theory this website provides very little to me, it doesn’t get me anywhere, my life would be the same if I didn’t have a blog, but I still want to have one.</p><p>Call it a hobby if you will, but writing gives me something that nothing else provides. I love talking to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/">people on my podcast</a>, and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-obsidian-set/">I love journaling</a>, but getting thoughts to the stage where they can be published (even rushed ones) helps me tremendously. So, when thinking about things you need, it is not always a simple equation that can be worked out. Just because on the surface it gives me nothing in return doesn’t mean it has no value to me. In fact, the opposite, and I would argue that more people should have one.</p><p>The benefits of it run far deeper than the sum of its parts. No person should judge their blog based on the number of views the posts get because it always serves a different purpose. It allows you to publish whatever it is you want to publish, get it out of your brain and own it from start to end. I don’t need a blog, but everyone should have one.</p>

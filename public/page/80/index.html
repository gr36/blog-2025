  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Twitter is great for me. It&rsquo;s open, varied and has provided me with a platform to meet some good friends what I would have no other way of interacting with. Sometimes it’s a bit of a dumpster fire when Apple releases something or a major event happens but is bearable again after a few hours. Yet, the platform has been almost insufferable for more than 5 years now and the depressing state of American Politics is starting to swallow the internet.</p>
<p>When browsing Twitter you can usually avoid most things with a few blocked accounts and some careful curation of keywords when news stories start to break. It takes some work, but you can get 90% of the way there with a little effort. Yet, at some point, it reaches the point of diminishing returns and feels a little like you’re fighting a raging inferno with a garden hose. Which is easy to sort, you just don’t use Twitter — even though it used to be one of your favorite places to hang out.</p>
<p>Which feels a little like the bullies from school kicking you out of your treehouse but there are much more important things in life. However, what exactly can I do when almost every platform I use is bleeding American Political information, half of which is aimed at causing a fallout, on every visit?</p>
<p>No doubt the topics discussed are important, but they are also depressing, annoying, uninteresting, and fail to have a direct effect on my life. However, it is rammed down my throat at every turn. Reddit is somewhat understandable when you stray into the trading tab, but <a href="https://app.getpocket.com/discover">Pocket is filled with recommendations</a> to read yet more dressing news and even newsletters I previously loved contain nothing but information that heads straight to the bin.</p>
<p>If these sorts of posts are important to you — great, keep on sharing them and taking part in the discussion — but where can I go to avoid such things other than hitting the off button completely? Calls for American Politics filters on platforms started out as a joke by users, but now need to become reality sooner rather than later. For risk of turning people away, and alienating the majority of the world. Please help us, we are drowning in other people&rsquo;s worries.</p>

<p>I love the web. It is my favourite place to be when it’s functioning well and the people are nice. However, more and more tending to the social media garden is required to make these platforms a nice place to be. I am glad to say I have suffered very little abuse, but not zero, my main issue is the tendency of false and at a time frankly ridiculous information to come up in my feed.</p>
<p>There are numerous users that seem to think the internet gives them the right to publish absolutely anything they like and not ever be held accountable. Platforms have almost zero motivation to clamp down on those harassing and abusing individuals. because it maximises engagement. With even less attention payed to controlling the information placed on them.</p>
<p>I am firmly of the belief that Social Media platforms should be held accountable for the information published to it by their users. With the ability to remove, and punish anybody found to be abusing their ability to post to the web. The right of free speech does not mean every user has the right to an open platform.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing push by a section of the US to remove section 230 that protects internet giants from this. Although this is for completely different reasons, I think that by changing the protection it holds will lead to a much better internet and one that flourishes with independent thought published by individuals. The public square of the internet needs to be decentralised and moved back to a time when everyone had their say but was also accountable for everything they chose to publish.</p>

      <p>Whenever I introduce someone new to mediation, they always look at me a bit quizzically. Not sure if I am being serious or wondering how I have hidden my woo-woo tendencies so well. Expecting me to suggest they go and sit in a cave for a week or buy some new orange robes.</p><p>You see, the vast majority of people seem to think that meditation involves sitting crossed legged on the floor, humming to yourself, or other such tropes seem to be very widespread. When in fact it is the simplest, humblest practice you can do, just sitting and paying attention to only your breath.</p><p>It seems bizarre the first time you try out a guided mediation, and you can’t concentrate on your breathing for more than a few moments. Utterly humbling, a bit of a shock, and I wonder how many people will give up here because they think this is failing. However, that is part of the process of mediation — a <a href="https://rossstevenson.medium.com/meditation-is-bicep-curls-for-your-mind-4b4c704682fd">bicep curl for the mind</a>.</p><p>There is no woo-woo, no magic and no new technology involved. One of the oldest and simplest practices in the world will teach you more about yourself than anything else, and it requires absolutely no outlay.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>
<div>
<p>I have been transfixed with one of the best podcasts I have ever listened to. <a href="https://www.airr.io/episode/5f996887ecce6a84de95fb83">Yuval Noah Harari spoke to Tim Ferris</a> for a little under two hours and left me with so much more to think about now regarding knowing suffering and also knowing yourself.</p>
<p>It is easy to find out what makes us happy, and what brightens our mood because it’s instant and identifiable. But what even is suffering and what it is doing to us is a much harder thing to pin down and solve. Pain is suffering, we can understand and highlight the issue and at least try and solve the issue.</p>
<p>We don’t have enough money perhaps is causing us misery, so the easy solution is to try and get more money. However, is the money really the problem, or is it the illusion we need more money, or the things we buy that causing us to be miserable. As Yuval talks about there as much deeper mechanisms at play in our lives and without understanding them and ourselves we could be trying to solve proximal issues and not the real root causes.</p>
<p>Perhaps this links back to mindfulness and meditation above, but so many people I know are completely uncomfortable being alone with their own thoughts to a stage that they are constantly distracted from themselves. Knowing yourself and being aware of what is going on inside you is one of the most important things you can do to improve so many things in your life.</p>

<p>I keep coming across the opinion that 230 should be saved and if it is overturned then this would be the end of the internet. However, much like the link here, I am very much of the opinion that holding platforms more accountable should be the way to go if we want a better internet.</p>
<p>A Facebook or Twitter than can be sued for hosting content is one that is over the top in what can be posted to it – the result is a better, more positive experience.</p>
<p>Want to stay into the web and read what your favourite people are saying then we return to the good old blogging days, where speech is more honest and can be held accountable easily. No more hiding, no more click bate and we restrict the level of mis information being spread.</p>
<p>Clearly the reason that Conservatives want to repeal this bill has nothing to do with a safer internet, but I don’t think they would really get what they think if they succeed. Perhaps I don’t understand this fully but I really can’t see a downside.</p>

<p>What motivated all this was the fact there are some games that I want to play. You know those titles that everyone around you seem to be playing, and you just want to join in. The last title that did this to me was Red Dead Redemption 2 that I purchased a PS4 pro to play and before the month was out sat gathering dust, ending up being sold on a little later.</p>
<p>This time it’s Cyberpunk 2077. A title that I really didn’t want to have to buy hardware to run it, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-10-cyberpunk-2077-is-super-rough-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-and-the-memes-have-already-begun">really don’t want to pick up an old console</a> to play it either. So, this is where Google Stadia comes in. The cloud streaming service that has been steadily improving over the last few months after poor release reviews, but might just be the place to play without having to splash too much cash on top of the line hardware.</p>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Googles solution to next-generation gaming is a streaming service that offers top of the line graphics without having to stump up the money for hardware. It’s a future that has been promised for some years now, and all of a sudden we have a few competing platforms that don’t work together.</p>
<h2>What do you need?</h2>
<p>Google Stadia requires very little to get you gaming. The most important of these things is a good internet connection. It doesn’t have to be the fastest in the world, but it needs to be reliable. In order to game wherever I wanted I’ve had to upgrade my router, but that shouldn’t be needed for most people. You will also need to check your data caps because you reusing upwards of 5GB per hour.</p>
<p>As far as hardware, you’ll first need a controller, any old one will do, I’ve been using a PS4 one I borrowed from a friend. As long as you can pair it with a mobile device you can get up and running in no time. One thing to bear in mind is that new Xbox controller don’t pair with all computers. You can stream stadia to ‘any device that runs chrome’. I’ve used my MacBook, iPad, iPhone and an ancient Chromebook all with good results. It also works flawlessly with mobile safari and also desktop Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> splash for a Stadia specific controller if you like. Which I eventually did and picked one up for £35 from CEX, but they are available direct from Google. Opt for the Premier edition if you can afford it for £80, and you’ll get a Chromecast ultra too. This means you can play on your TV with ease but again you can pick these up cheeper at resellers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/89a85c0b39.jpg" alt="Stadia Final Google 1" title="Stadia-Final-Google-1.jpg" border="0" width="599" height="337" /></p>
<h2>What can you play?</h2>
<p>Not every game is available on Stadia so don’t get too excited. There is a large range of games that are growing all the time like Cyberpunk 2077, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Hitman 3 (soon). However, there are loads of games missing, so this won’t replace a home console completely — yet. One noticeable absence for me is FIFA 21, but it’s <a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/11/05/fifa-21-google-stadia/">coming early this year</a>.</p>
<p>If you sign up for a free stadia account you’ll get a copy of Destiny 2 and Bomberman online completely free. Opt for the Pro subscription, and you can choose from a whole range of games to play for free while your subscription is live.</p>
<h2>How well does it work?</h2>
<p>On its initial launch Google Stadia was littered with poor connection issues and huge lag. Thankfully, this is pretty much gone. Lag will depend on your internet connection first, which I have a pretty stable and fast one. There are some impossible to diagnose issues that sometimes crop up, usually ISP related and can be solved by rebooting your rooter.</p>
<p>The UI of webpages or native apps takes a little getting used to as well as working out the options you have available when signing up. Hopefully, as the service becomes more main steam things like this will improve.</p>
<p>Finding games and starting one from your library could use some work, but when it comes to playing, I have experienced very few issues in my super-fast internet bubble.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cccc32dc71.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2021 01 03 at 13 12 53 1" title="Screenshot-2021-01-03-at-13.12.53-1.png" border="0" width="1000" height="463" /></p>
<h2>What does it cost</h2>
<p>There are quite a few moving parts here, and the website is <a href="https://stadia.google.com/">more than a little confusing</a>. Google of course push you towards signing up without much information. To play Cyberpunk 2077, which is all I set to do, it set me back the price of the game (£50). I borrowed a controller and used an iPad I already had.</p>
<p>There are two free games included with your account Destiny 2 and Bomberman Online, so you can start playing for free. Opt for a ‘Pro’ subscription for £8 a month, and you can claim any of a growing range of games. However, you can only play this while you have an active subscription. Outside the games a pro subscription allows you to stream in 4k, with HDR also available depending on the speed of your internet connection.</p>
<p>There is a free month trial with no purchase necessary to try out a few games and get the feel of the place. Allowing you to play all currently available pro games for a month without a charge. Google sell a Premier Edition controller and Chromecast Ultra for £80 which is the most versatile option, but you can pick these up for very little money in other places.</p>
<p>Games vary in price from a few pounds to large amounts depending on the package you wish to buy.</p>
<h2>Sum Google Stadia up for me</h2>
<p>If like me, you want to play the occasional game and don’t want to spend hundreds on hardware. Chances are you can get going with things you already have or for very minimal outlay. Unfortunately, not all games are available but there is a large library of releases.</p>
<p>The most important thing you will need is a fast, stable connection. If that sounds like you, Stadia is a great way to play almost anywhere.</p>

<p>Just in time for the holidays Apple released <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/go/apple_fitness_plus/">Fitness +</a> to the masses and it’s actually pretty good. The barrier to entry unfortunately is pretty high, needing an Apple Watch and a subscription, but I’ve tried it out a little due to having the Premier Apple One Bundle.</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to get into yoga, but after attending a few ‘beginners classes’ that were definitely not for beginners, Fitness + has allowed me to get going at my pace. There are a huge range of workouts (not an ad) and I’ve enjoyed some HIIT training, with the only downside not being able to change the music and most of it is rubbish!</p>
<p>The biggest thing I have discovered though is the huge amount of these types of videos available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=workout">for free on YouTube</a>. Sure you don’t get the integration and display of your move-rings on screen, but some of them are brilliantly done. Just another thing that could help if your New Year’s resolution is to work out more, and it might just cut down your spending to — no one needs an expensive gym subscription.</p>

<p>At the moment I am fascinated by the beliefs of others. Not religious or cultural thinking, but the rise of anti-vaccination belief and the other crazy conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>I think this has been exaggerated by COVID-19, but I have always had an interest in the weird things that go on inside other peoples head. Lord knows I have plenty of weird things going on in mine. I am still not sure if there is a stark rise in the existence of people that believe in crazy conspiracy theories, or that they just have the ability to shout louder now.</p>
<p>The psychology of this type of thinking is not linked to intelligence as most people believe, but in fact the higher IQ the person has they can stick much firmer to their beliefs and come up with a greater argument for them. It has more to do with tribalism and the beliefs you have being an indicator of the group you belong to.</p>
<blockquote><p>Motivated reasoning is how people convince themselves or remain convinced of what they want to believe—they seek out agreeable information and learn it more easily; and they avoid, ignore, devalue, forget, or argue against information that contradicts their beliefs. — <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/this-article-wont-change-your-mind/519093/">Julie Beck</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The stories we tell others are a test to see who we believe we can trust. The way people react tells us if they are a person we wish to have around and there would be many anthropological benefits to this. But when you don’t have 150 people around you, you have millions online the weirder the behaviour is.</p>
<p>Think about this when interacting with others over the holiday period. I know we may not be sharing a dinner table with as many people as usual, but you’re still going to come across people that do not believe the same things as you. This doesn’t make them an idiot, it makes them human, try as hard as you can to learn something from the conversations you have — because getting mad gets you nowhere.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Since the launch of iOS14 we’ve seen an influx of widgets for your Home Screen. Apple having finally launched a viable way for you to not only customise the look of your phone, but also gain access to information you need at a glance. So being the health conscious individual I am, I wanted something to help me display the data I need at a glance right on my home-screen and here it is – <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1493350670">Fitness Totals</a>.</p>
<p>Managing your long terms fitness goals can be extremely difficult and many options out there seemed to be aimed at athletes rather than those that want to just get active, or shed a bit of the Christmas plump put on over the festive period. Instead of making you feel out of place, Fitness Totals places the emphasis on your weekly and monthly activity totals. Giving you the option to display walking/running, but also cycling, swimming, and wheelchair pushes/distance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b3e0dc623a.jpg" alt="Image 1" title="Image-1.png" border="0" width="1000" height="368" /><br />
You can choose from a whole range of different widget options in both light and dark mode, as well as 14 different app icons. Meaning that you can tailor the experience to your taste and view the data you value, whenever you need it.</p>
<p>I have been testing the app through its beta period and finding it extremely useful for comparing those stats that really matter to me. Having taken up cycling this year, and particularly enjoying walks with my dog, it’s great to get all the data I value but not have to worry about starting workouts or feeding my information into another service. Fitness Totals plugs straight into Apple Health and uses on device processing, so your data <a href="https://fitnesstotals.com/#container02">never leaves your phone</a>. You <em>can</em> send your fitness totals to others if you choose to. The sharing features are particularly useful for a bit of friendly competition and give you a bit of a push!</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re active like me or just thinking about a New Year’s resolution. You can download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1493350670">Fitness Totals</a> from the App Store for just £2.99 and keep focused on your health.</p>

<div>
<p>After reading <a href="https://tablethabit.substack.com/p/newsletters-vs-blogging?r=7zbud&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=copy">Jeff Perry recent change of heart</a> regarding running a newsletter it really got me thinking about publishing. Whilst I agree wholeheartedly that publishing your work should be as easily available as possible there is just something about writing a newsletter that isn’t the same as a blog post.</p>
<p>Could it be the way I write my blog posts? Perhaps it’s the more personal touch of popping my thoughts into something that appears in your inbox — I’m not really to sure — but I could never stop writing this. I am pleased with the mix I have between reviewing phones and posting tech things, and then sharing short, completely ad-hoc thoughts in a more personal way. I never thought I would get as many readers as I do (I only check subscribers before I send the latest edition, there’s no tracking in my emails) and I am still surprised when people sign up!</p>
<p>Although there are many paid for newsletters that make a huge splash in niche industries or offer a unique personality, you have to earn the right to ask for money first in most instances. Sub-stack is not the best place for sharing your thoughts and ideas, it is a weird hybrid of newsletter and blog that putts too many hurdles in the way of reading in my honest opinion — perhaps Jeff would have been better doing it on Ghost? Who knows, but Jeff is awesome guy and is posting on <a href="https://tablethabit.com/">Tablethabbit.com</a>again.</p>

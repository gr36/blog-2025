  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For the last few years, I have been <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-cant-go/">looking to go back</a> to simpler times. Ones that didn’t try to hack my brain every time I open my phone. Or, in fact, a time when I didn’t need to carry a phone with me at all. Those times might be long gone, but I can’t just give up on my dream without a fight. After a bit of backwards and forwards, I think I might have found the best minimalist phone.</p><p>After experimenting with <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-smaller-phone/">older devices,</a> I felt unfulfilled and sometimes caused more hassle than they are worth. Recently, I tried a ‘dumb phone’ in the <a href="https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp02-4g-mobile-phone/">Punkt MP02</a>, which left a lot to be desired considering its £300 price tag. Couple this with the realisation that I need to be able to access some apps occasionally (How on earth do you do banking nowadays when the branches are hardly open?) – I was stuck. That was until I realised I had the best minimal device to replace my phone the whole time – my Apple Watch.</p><p>I’ve been <a href="/2015/05/17/i-like-this.html">in love with the Apple Watch</a>, particularly a <a href="/2021/10/05/a-month-without.html">cellular version</a>, for as long as I can remember. It allows me to leave my phone at home when I don’t need it but still be contactable, yet I couldn’t see its real usefulness until I took a step back. I truly think this could be the best minimalist approach to a world that seems to demand a smartphone.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/0ad9644b2f.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><h2 id="minimal">Minimal</h2><p>The screen is small and, although perfectly nice, isn’t appealing at all. Nothing about it tries to hack my brain to use it more. It just sits and does its thing without intervention until called upon. It has very few apps installed on it, most of which I can control and remove if not needed. Many services are not updating or removing their apps from the Apple Watch because they missed the point of it, but those that remain can be completely independent.</p><p>The notifications on Apple Watch are surprisingly powerful, but I did have to do a bit of work to turn many off. Apple still likes to ping you for far too many things by default – rings notifications, breathing stuff, hand-washing, and fitness all set to off. Sure you can also do this to your phone, which is recommended, but the Apple Watch just slips up a sleeve and becomes almost invisible when you don’t need it.</p><p>There's no conversation distractions, no facedown on a table dilemma, and no reason to not pay attention to the world. Much like a dumb phone, it just waits for interaction from others. Taking up very little space in the world, and much of the time you can't tell it’s there.</p><h2 id="useful">Useful</h2><p>Podcasts and music work perfectly, streaming over LTE and playing through my AirPods is a dream when out and about. Not to mention, Apple Pay still stores all of my cards and allows me to pay exactly as I would with my phone. Unfortunately, the weird looks and slight embarrassment when using your watch never subsides.</p><p>As someone who has health issues currently, the Apple Watch has really shown its usefulness. Being able to pull my phone out or share data with a healthcare professional that proves my resting heart rate, activity levels and all sorts of other indicators is wonderful. Having a device strapped to my wrist that is actually more useful in many ways has proven to be great to rid myself of other devices when I don't need them.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/ba83862d88.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><h2 id="intentional">Intentional</h2><p>With all this said, the thing I love most about adopting this approach is that it asked nothing in return. I can’t use it for much, but I can use it for everything useful. All whist not being a phone at all. Unfortunately, I still require a phone to set the Apple Watch up, but the bonus being that for those times I <em>do</em> need a more regular looking phone I have one. However, due to just how useful my Apple Watch has been, should it ever rid itself of the iOS reliance, I <em>may</em> consider not replacing my phone.</p><p>Perhaps my perfect combination would be an iPad Mini and an Apple Watch. I can't see a future where the smartphone won't dominate our lives, but I am some way to freeing myself. The Apple Watch gives me a semi-smart device when required, and the accompanying phone gives me a phone if I <em>really</em> need one. Which isn't frequently, it sits alone on my desk because <a href="/2021/10/07/i-dont-use.html">I don't use it much</a>. Even less now.</p>

      <p>Coverage from Steriogum on Neil Young pulling <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2173905/neil-young-spotify-joe-rogan-vaccine-misinformation/news/">his music from Spotify </a>:</p><blockquote>In a open letter to his management and record label, which has since been taken down, Neil Young has asked that his music be promptly removed from Spotify, citing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on the platform. “I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines – potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them,” he wrote. “Please act on this immediately today and keep me informed of the time schedule.”</blockquote><p>If we are to constantly blame social media platforms for the miss information posted to their site (and we should). Then it only stands to reason that scrutiny should fall on everyone else too.</p><p>Where are the false information flags on podcasts, or even songs? Joe Rogan gets held to account more than anyone else because he’s so popular, and controversial. However his reach could be so damaging. There is only so many times you can hold your hands up and say “well I’m a dummy what do I know” before it wears thin.</p>

Breaking rule one is sacrilege and can lead to club banishment. Or in my case, people feeling bad — and I’m sorry.</p><p>I’ve had a few conversations over the last couple of weeks with people that I have talked through my choice to back away from social media and I’ve needed more words that I expected. Once you utter the words that you don’t use social media it puts anyone that does on the back foot. </p><p>Like a subtweet, or a slight of character it can feel personal. As if you’re casting aspersions towards anyone that does. Which in my case is not the case. I love sharing my thoughts and feelings on my blog, but also don’t want them to interfere with those of others.</p><p>There is no judgement here. You won’t find any big push to make you do something you don’t want to do. Whatever you choose to do with your own time is cool with me. More though needed when sharing on my part I think. </p>

      <p>Charlie Warzel talking about <a href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/61e9a30ddc551a002084a483/web3-debates-wordle/">Wordle in Galaxy Brain</a>:</p><blockquote>Wordle’s success has scrambled the brains of people in tech who have a reflexive desire to monetize things that are popular.</blockquote><p>What if I just want to do a thing because I like doing it. Not everything has to be sold, marketed and developed to a stage where i hate it. I just want a past time that I enjoy doing and sometimes it even costs me money! Take writing for example every platform now wants me to market it, sell it and build a brand when that is not what I want to do at all.</p><blockquote>the fact that the game is immensely popular suggests to me that maybe, just maybe, there’s a quorum of people who are tired of things that feel extractive</blockquote><p>Subscription fatigue is one thing but you can tell when things are trying to get things from you to fund it. Data, attention, or just setting you up for the payment hit later on. It feels exploitive and you can small it in the air from the start. </p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When I wake at silly times in the morning and get out of bed, I don’t even know why I put the TV on. I am not bothered about what is showing on the screen, it doesn’t light my way in the dark, I must turn the volume down so low it is impossible to hear. Yet, it’s always on because I can’t face the fact that I am staring at my gadgets.</p><p>Though it could be argued that my TV screen is nothing more than a larger one sucking my attention. An alternative to the smaller one in my hand, or the slightly less small one on my desk. It doesn’t feel as guilt ridden. If it's on, I’m not just staring at my phone, I am watching TV and happen to be using my phone at the same time. I am <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_screen">second screening</a> but not really.</p><p>When, in truth, the screen is nothing more than background noise to make myself feel a little better. Simply lit up to offer a little self assurance that I am not lost to the doom scroll or never-ending dopamine hits of red dots on my devices. That’s what other people do, not me. I might select a documentary to play while I pay little attention. Just to really prop up my ruse. Fooling myself that I am learning or consuming something worthwhile instead of doing what I don’t want to admit to myself that I am 100% doing.</p><p>The mental gymnastics my subconscious does to try to appease my ego is comforting. At least I can sit here, at 3am, safe in the knowledge that I am watching TV and perhaps learning something instead of loosing sleep to my phone. I am better than everyone else after all and deserve this background noise just to drown out the screams from my logical brain.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For years, I have imagined a future I seemingly cannot attain. One where I no longer have a need for a smartphone and don’t share my life on the internet. Perhaps I retire to a cabin in the woods. You know, that type of thing an old person raging against modern times would do. Granted, I am not old, and I have accepted <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-cant-go/">the smartphone need</a>, but what exactly would happen if I did quit the rest of it?</p><p>No one I know seems to have managed it. At least no one I hear from any more, and that’s the point, isn’t it. As Cheri points on in <a href="https://hypertext.monster/2021/07/17/no-social-media.html">No Social Media Club,</a> 30% of Americans don’t use social media at all, where are their ideas published? The only ideas I can take in are those that want to quit and either can’t (me) or don’t really want to (also me).</p><p>The fact is, I am also worried. Worried about the feelings that also disappear if I were to somehow slip out of the grasp of social media. By some chance that I lose my motivation to share my life online and interact with others, would I also share my voice? The reality is that if my motivation to share were at some point removed, so too would be my drive to write.</p><p>Would I become another person lost to the no social media club? Never talked about, unless someone occasionally remembers that person who managed to quit it all. Looked back on with the same weirdness as I remember the kids at school that didn’t have TVs at home. It didn’t matter that these families were tight-knit, much happier and actually enjoyed each other's company — the weirdos didn’t even watch the X Files!</p><p>I wasn’t around to publish before the platforms took over, and somewhere in an alternate timeline there’s a me that never started sharing things. Does he still write? I am positive my blog would die along with my interest in other peoples lives. As much as I do not write to be read, my whole blog is built around sharing thoughts and ideas to faceless people. If I don’t share with people I like, I doubt I would publish at all.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The straw that broke the camel's back, or <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-finally-deletedfacebook/">broke my relationship with Facebook</a>, was a podcast on ghosting. I am pretty sure everyone knows what it is by now, but in essence it is the idea that you don’t want to deal with issues so you just ignore them, and by them, I mean people. I didn’t like the idea that I was cross posting to Facebook, as if I were there, but never replying to any posts. I was Ghosting.</p><p>That was more than 4 years ago now, and I don’t regret it for a second. However, I see the same social media ghosting going on all over the place. In an effort to cross posting everything everywhere there are massive holes developing and some times it’s sad to see them. I am guilty of this currently, I haven’t quite figured out what I am going to use and what I am not, so <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/cross-posting-to/">Twitter cross posting</a> can come across a bit rude. I can only apologise.</p><p>There’s a certain level of expectations from comments on social media. Sure they don’t all deserve replies, but I might be in the minority here, but it feels weird to leave the service completely. Sure, you’re not responsible for where your content gets posted, but cross posting appears just like a normal post. So, I’m a bit uncomfortable with it. On services such as micro.blog this is really obvious. It is littered with users that have signed up at some point, added their RSS feed and have not checked in for a long time.</p><p>Posts are receiving replies, asking questions and giving feedback to no avail. Many users seem under the impression these posts are by active users, which is a real shame. Twitter, Facebook and Mastodon are littered with these ghost posts. Does it matter, no, is it something I think about, of course. It’s great to be able to share your work everywhere and get more people to view it, but I like to monitor it at least a bit just so I don’t seem rude</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>To be honest, I never wanted to talk about the metaverse. An idea that has been floating around since at least the 70s that we are all going to live in VR one day. Populating a world that replicates our old one but allows us to do it somehow better. This idea only being pushed into the forefront again because Facebook wanted to take some light off its rubbish pile of a service.</p><p>Instead, insisting the company, now called Meta, was going to focus its efforts on building a metaverse for us all to live in, and this couldn’t be further from what people want if they tried. There’s no denying that technology will get to a stage where it can augment, and in many ways replace, the real one. The sad fact is we might need this if we continue to build data centres and mine cryptocurrency to buy digital crap instead of fixing the world we have. No-one want it to be built by Facebook, though.</p><p>Yet, the fundamental idea presented is flawed on so many levels, I am surprised we are still talking about it. That is without the notion that a company like Facebook is going to power such a world to begin with. I don’t want to even go there with the idea that Facebook can somehow be trusted to “bring us all together” when we are perfectly capable of doing that without a viewer strapped to our head. Let’s take a step back for a minute.</p><p>The Metaverse that Meta presented was one of replacement. A massive pitch of a rendered reality, not one that can actually be made, instead of the one we live in. Mark presented alternative ways to meet, make meetings, even shop, all in VR and the idea is laughable. No one wants to do those things. No worker in the world wants to have a meeting as it is. Spending time and money recreating something that no one wants to do, instead of finding a way to eliminating that thing, is Silicon Valley at its finest.</p><p>What's this? I can push a cart around a virtual grocery store and pick up things off a shelf? I don’t even want to do that in real life, and the technology available to us has already allowed that menial task to be eliminated. Do I even need shopping at all, unless it's for the preselected nutritional paste that is pumped directly into my system because I can’t take the mask of my face because of all the fun I am having watching digital concerts and chatting to my friends in VR?</p><p>To burrow down to the core of the issue that I have is that there is nothing new here. Nothing that makes the world a better place, and solves problems. There are, for instance, massive benefits of using VR for disabled people. Improving accessibility and making interaction easier. Nothing is solved by it, but another layer is added on top to make things as ‘normal’ as possible. There’s no pitch to this effect, though. Just privileged folk having meetings or watching a concert with a headset on that they could do in person, or with existing tools.</p><p>Add to this the very real side effect that all this energy and work being done is destroying our planet anyway, it seems like some kind of shortsighted dystopian story. A tale of solving problems that occur from the problem trying to be solved. Yet, the solution is already possible.</p>

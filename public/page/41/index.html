  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’ve been mulling over these thoughts for months now, but resisted on posting them because of the backlash. I know I should never do that, and feel free to post what I want, but you know what the internet is like. Following yesterday&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/10/apple-unveils-completely-redesigned-ipad-in-four-vibrant-colors/">meagre offering</a> following 18 months of development, the time has come. The iPad sucks now, and that’s a real shame.</p>
<p>I used to be that guy. The one that used his iPad for everything and preached about it at every available opportunity. Selling the iPad to anyone that would listen and teaching people the tricks you needed to make it really work. This was way back on an original iPad Air, then a long line of Pro variations. Then one day I just kind of ‘woke up’.</p>
<p>I had an epiphany and realised that it wasn’t the iPad that was so great. I mean it was good, and Apple were doing what they needed to do, but it was the apps and particularly Shortcuts that made it. Apple broke several of my much-needed shortcuts to get things done, and the whole thing fell apart.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cca9f7d8c9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html">So I quit</a>. Publicly and emotionally, I’d had enough of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole. Fortunately, Apple now sells a perfect replacement for those that like myself spent thousands on iPad Pros with keyboards and pencils in the form of the M1 MacBooks. I chose the Max variant in an MacBook Pro, but many switched to the new Air and spent <em>less</em>.</p>
<p>I didn’t care so much for ‘pro apps’. Or for them to allow me to use external monitors correctly. All I wanted was for them to stop messing around with the way the iPad actually worked and decide what it wanted to be. At the point of quitting, the iPad existed in somewhat of an oxymoronic state, in that it was costly but not all that capable. The software was flakey and didn’t really ever live up to the promises Apple made.</p>
<p>The iPad still exists in that same position, but the terms are worse. My initial quitting was three years ago and nothing has changed. There has been some kind of awakening of late. One where users that previously waved their ’iPad guy’ flag have realised they are indeed doing themselves a disservice. The reality is unless you explicitly need a touchscreen, the iPad Pro is a poor, expensive, choice. Apple still has no idea what they want the iPad to be, and even less of an idea on the ‘pro’ versions.</p>
<p>Base model iPads now come in at £500. Which is at least £100 more expensive than you should be paying for a consumption device. Sure, it can work with keyboards and pencils (kind of), but that’s not the appeal of an entry-level tablet. Couple this with a confused lineup of Airs and unimproved £1000+ pro devices, leaves next to no appeal.</p>
<p>The answer to the age-old question of “what iPad should I buy” is now “last year&rsquo;s model”. Should anyone dare to ask what tablet they can get to do some work on might need some follow-up questions, but in reality the correct reply is “a Surface Pro”. That hurts a little.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2022/10/17/how-i-use.html"><h1 class="p-name">How I Use OMG.lol Statuses</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The fun little service <a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a> is the new hotness on micro.blog and seems to be seeping out into the wider internet. Not only is it ridiculously cheap for what you get, the developer Adam seems to be making constant updates and offering more and more value for money. For just £5 per year you get access to a landing page for your social media, mastodon instance, email forwarding and my favourite service — statuslog.</p>
<p>Statuslog allows you to post small updates containing whatever you wish, along with an emoji. Exactly the type of thing that allows you to share what you are up to without having to interact with a service. As with everything omg.lol creates, it’s brilliantly designed and easy to customise for your use.</p>
<h2 id="statusonmyblog">Status On My Blog</h2>
<p>I have embraced the set-up of micro.blog. It promotes using your blog for shorter posts as well as longer ones to keep hold of your content. There are just some posts that I don’t care about, and are what Twitter was really made for. Short, to the point life updates, that have no value — think “drinking coffee” and not tweet storms of information.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/e6a68339d4.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>I put the status card right at the top of my blog home page, so should anyone land on it, they can see what I am currently up to. The level of usefulness is debatable, but I like it! For a full walk through of getting this set up see the help page <a href="https://home.omg.lol/info/statuslog">here</a>, but in short I put in the following code.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src="https://status.lol/[your-address].js?time&amp;link&amp;fluent&amp;pretty"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="styling">Styling</h3>
<p>Thankfully, the styling of the status card looks great out the box, so it’s rare you will have to do anything. I wanted it to look more like part of my blog, so I styled a few elements. This took me a bit of trial and error to get this correct. When I first implemented by own changes, I used the <code>&amp;pretty</code> on the end of the script and simply styled the areas I wanted. However, this now uses some <code>!important</code> styling and as such breaks any custom styling you want to override.</p>
<p>To style the status card, you will need to remove <code>&amp;pretty</code> from the script above and style <em>everything</em> in CSS. The default CSS used at the time of writing is below, however this could change at any time.</p>
<pre><code>.statuslol_container {
<p>},</p>
<p>.statuslol {
display: flex;
flex-wrap: wrap;
gap: 1em;
background: #e7ebf3;
color: #111;
border-radius: .5em;
padding: 1em;
}</p>
<p>.statuslol_emoji_container {
flex: 0 0 1em;
font-size: 3em;
padding-right: 0;
}</p>
<p>.statuslol_content {
flex-grow: 1;
flex-shrink: 1;
flex-basis: 0;
margin: -.5em 0 0 0;
text-align: left;
overflow-wrap: break-word;
overflow-wrap: anywhere;
color: #111 !important;
}</p>
<p>.statuslol_time {
opacity: .5; color: #111 !important;
}
</code></pre></p>
<p>You can then go for your life, change anything and everything you want to, and make it look to your taste. I love the stock gradient of the card, but implemented my own darker version I found on <a href="https://uigradients.com/#Quepal">UI Gradients</a>.</p>
<h2 id="postingstatuses">Posting Statuses</h2>
<p>For a long time, I have wanted to be able to post tweets without actually opening the app. This used to be straightforward with Shortcuts (née Workflow) but the best you can do now is transfer text into the app to tweet from it. This is where the excellent statuslog service comes in. I use it to post a short update, which is posted to micro.blog, Twitter and Mastodon.</p>
<p>If you are a Drafts user, you can use a <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2DT">really nice action</a> to update your status easily. However, I am not, so after some inspiration from micro.blog user and omg.lol unofficial ambassador <a href="https://micro.blog/maique/13513088">Maique </a> I created a Shortcut to do this. You can grab the shortcut from <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2be68317c569484781cea2ca32c8b03c">here</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/298c6757ab.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>To use this Shortcut, you will need an API key for your OMG.LOL account, that can be found <a href="https://home.omg.lol/account#api-key">here</a>, and also put your account username in the other box as outlined on importing the Shortcut. As you can see, I have added this to my Home Screen for easy access and made an icon, which is below.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/7bbfda8759.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Icon available <a href="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7bbfda8759.jpg">here</a></p>
<p>If you then wish to then import the status into micro.blog the RSS feed you will need is <code>http://[your-address].status.lol/feed</code> replace your address with yours. If you do not use micro.blog there are automation services such as <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> that can Tweet whenever an RSS feed is updated.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It’s that time of year again. At the point where our business starts to get a little less busy and other staff start catching up on their projects, mine takes off. There’s no reason for it, but something always crops up or needs competing each year, so I’m a little used to it by now. Last year we decided to redesign all of our brochures and then launch a new website the week before Christmas!</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s task has completely taken me out of my comfort zone. Even though a large portion of my work is design, I’ve never been good at original illustration. A sliding it like the plague and relying on others to do the heavy lifting. Low and behold, this project requires loads of it and has been stressing me out, lots.</p>
<p>So much, so I could not sleep last night due to worrying about things I was not happy with. Not a great felling, but ultimately, I <a href="https://twitter.com/gr36/status/1581206616149368832?s=46&amp;t=L5bOxTFXcObW64cqE8Y5hQ">gave up at 4am on Saturday</a> and worked it through. A few hours later, I’m happier with the outcome and have actually developed my skills no end. This bit of pressure has pushed me to work on skills that I avoid if I can do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s still a long way to go for this project, and I am still no artist, but the pressure has actually helped.</p>

      <p>I thought for a long time that the pandemic had ruined me. Despite being one of the lucky ones and not being greatly affected by it outside the obvious, I have never felt the same since. The <a href="/2022/07/27/210805.html">pins and needles I feel in my brain</a> has gone into overdrive and I feel constantly burnt out.</p>
<p>I’ve recognised this, and for quite a while I have been trying to get back to the way I was before the pandemic. Don’t get me wrong, the 18 or so months suffering its wrath did not ruin me, but I just don’t feel myself anymore. I don’t think I am alone in this, but it is more obvious because during the lockdowns I weirdly managed to shine. Dealing with a crisis suits me well, and remaining calm and collected under pressure is fairly easy. Unfortunately, the adrenaline and focus have now gone, replaced by emptiness and a sense of being lost.</p>
<p>In the little over 9 months the UK spent really struggling to get things under control, I became the fittest and healthiest I have been for years. The fact we were all at home together meant I had time and space outside of working to really exercise. I <a href="/2020/05/18/getting-injured-was.html">discovered my love of cycling</a> on empty roads, and despite my waking hours seemingly being separated by the hours I drank coffee and those I consume beer, I thrived.</p>

<p>My spiral down began two weeks before Christmas 2021 when I had my COVID-19 vaccine booster shot. It knocked me off my feet for weeks. So much so, my heart and lungs have never been the same since. I am still exhausted when doing small things, but I can still run a little, providing I break through an invisible barrier and manage to keep going. I have no idea what is up with me, and no doctor will listen to what I need to fix. As such my mental health has suffered dramatically, being able to exercise is one of my only enjoyments in life.</p>
<p>I am trying really hard to get back to where I was, but being nearly 40 I feel like my body is fighting me at every step. I yearn to be back to where I was in what feels like the blink of an eye ago, but that dream always seems out of sight. No matter the effort I put in, no matter the dedication I have, I just can’t reach the proverbial carrot on a stick. In many ways, I am mourning the loss of myself, but I will not accept the me I am now. There was to be a return to normal somewhere down the line, and it best be soon.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Over the years, I have become used to most of my life being like swimming in the sea. Bobbing up and down and having to work with the environment to get the best out of my experience. There is absolutely no point in me trying to swim against the tide, nor ignoring the waves for risk of them breaking over my head. It’s best to just ride it out.</p>
<p>There have been points where I have tried to force it. <a href="/2020/08/17/sitting-in-the.html">Sitting in my chair</a>, and fretting over writing something because last week it was easy. When in reality I had obsoletely nothing that I <a href="/2021/11/19/something-to-say.html">needed nor wanted to say</a> at that point. I have attempted to break through walls and run distances simply because I used to be able to do it, when in reality the tide was on its way out.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8e7193da11.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In contrast, there have been times when I have struggled through the adversity. Smashed through the wall and taken much more away from the experience. Run personal bests following a moment of dread before lacing up my trainers and doing it anyway. The sweetest victories are those that I fought uphill, against the grain, and at points thought about quitting.</p>
<p>When the tide swells, I’ve learnt to just go with it. My inspiration is something I have to take advantage of while it is there and publish thoughts as they arise. I have to capitalise on motivation to exercise when it is there to make sure I can have down days and not feel bad about it. The most important thing I have to do is listen to myself and understand why. To discover in myself the reason for having to ride the waves to avoid drowning, when some days I’m carried forward by them.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There’s a lot more I can say on this topic that I am currently motivated to type out. After being a faithful Pocket subscriber for years, I switched to Matter months ago and have never looked back. Well, maybe <a href="/2022/10/02/recommended-reading.html">once or twice</a>.</p>
<p>Among a slew of new ’read it later’ apps, Matter stands out as it&rsquo;s what everyone seems to use. It’s the new hotness, and most of that is because it <a href="/2022/02/15/link-posts-from.html">plugs into everything</a> and allows you to <a href="/2022/08/20/the-fact-i.html">do more with your reading</a>. This is the only reason I am still using it, despite it ripping out all the social features I loved.</p>
<p>That is a little tongue in cheek, but my real worry is how exactly this is going to make money. No doubt this will be a subscription service in the not too distant future, and I expect a significantly priced one considering the development that has gone into it. This worries me because of the level of data I have invested in an app that I don’t know how much they will sting me for. In comparison to an effectively free service offered by Pocket.</p>
<p>The rest of the questions on comparing the apps is what you want from them. They both achieve similar things. Matter has the ability for you to add in newsletters and RSS feeds, whereas Pocket surfaces much better recommended articles. When it comes the reading itself they are both on equal footing, which just about every other competing app is.</p>
<h1 id="in-short">In Short</h1>
<p>Pocket is like a reliable pickup truck that’s getting on a bit. It’s been built for a specific job and does it very well. It’s not filled full of the latest tech, and you don’t see any upgrades coming. However, you know what you are getting. It’s reliable and will be around for years to come.</p>
<p>Matter is a Tesla. It&rsquo;s the latest and greatest, filled full of all the toys and plugs into all sorts of extensions. You’ll need to get used to a few quirks though and learn how to use it best. The problem is: We don’t really know how long it will last and how much it’s going to cost us eventually.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with either option, but there will be one that fits you best.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>My blog has being going for almost a decade. In that time, technology has transformed my life and the way I write has gone through some pretty major shifts. What was first typed into a frustratingly slow WordPress installation can now be published from a variety of apps with surprising ease, and often now straight from my phone.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, publishing from a mobile isn’t new. I was doing everything from my iPad for years, and this is the same. More of a realisation of the true power that smartphones and the internet hold for us. There’s a lot of doom and gloom surrounding them, and more and more people wanting to ditch them (<a href="/2021/04/16/back-as-far.html">myself included</a>) but you are mistaken if you think it is all bad news.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2d67eb5d85.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s remarkable that I am currently sat in my car waiting, <a href="/2022/09/16/constantly-waiting.html">as I always do</a>, and typing out my thoughts to instantly post online. I might even spell check them first! This is my pushback against the thousands of posts I see telling anyone that will listen how bad their phone is. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been there, all the minimalism people ask you to ditch it and that used to get me down. Currently <a href="/2021/08/26/minimalism-and-big.html">I choose a big phone because I can do things on it</a> that I would usually need a regular computer for. I can shape and mould this tool to enable me to do things and at the same time be aware of the downsides.</p>
<p>Publishing is my thing, and the fact I can do it all the time in situations where I might otherwise be bored or <a href="/2022/08/02/writing-instead-of.html">scrolling social media</a> should be appreciated. I can see myself doing this more and more as time goes on, and it gives a nice contrast when I sit at my computer all day doing other things.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There’s some crazy weirdness surrounding Elon Musk. He’s the darling child of what seems like all the internet, but <a href="https://time.com/6171726/elon-musk-fake-followers/">most of his followers</a> are paid for. Unfortunately for someone held in such high regard by tech bros everywhere as some kind of god, his <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23108357/redacted-version-of-exhibits-a-j-to-letter-to-the-honorable-kathaleen-st-j-mccormick-from-edward-b.pdf">phone records have revealed</a> his ideas actually kind of suck, and he’s surround by sycophantic suck ups.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go into the ins and outs of what is contained in his texts and emails, there are more intelligent people than I to do that. What I will say is that reading some of these summarisations has made me feel much better about my business life. No longer am I held back by the ideas that some of them might suck. As <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/elon-musk-texts-twitter-trial-jack-dorsey/671619/">Charlie Warzel</a> pointed out, “Whoever said there are no bad ideas in brainstorming never had access to Elon Musk’s phone”.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f8e238e7bf.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There truly are some absolute stinkers that come from both Elon and his long list of suck ups. Two of my favourites are Elon suggesting that people pay to tweet (at a cost of 0.1 Dodge Coin) and Jason Calacanis having “the best idea ever for monetization,”. His world-changing brain fart was charging famous people to be able to spam their followers with DMs. This is without the several conversations that exist in which they try to “solve free speech”.</p>
<p>Never again am I going to chastise myself for having poor ideas, or even a lack of good ones. Clearly not the only reason, but a large part of people like Musk’s success comes down to finance backing and the availability of opportunity. Which is about as far away from what we are led to believe. We are told that the reason he is so successful is his ridiculously long days, or his tenacious attitude to working. Not the billions in the bank, and being surrounded by people that can provide opportunities to thrive.</p>
<p>Both of these things are true of Musk, and he does a much better job of application than I ever could. However, peaking into his phone records gives me a behind the curtain glimpse. Allowing me to understand the real workings of those in successful positions. My ideas might sometimes suck, but they don’t suck as bad as this, and if they did, I would keep it to myself!</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The best advice I give anyone who wants to become good at something, is to do it. <a href="/2020/08/17/sitting-in-the.html">Constantly and consistently</a>, become obsessed and love the practice. This goes double for photography. Unfortunately, I think social media has ruined the expectation of taking photos and that really sucks.</p>
<p>I was at one time worried about only taking photos that everyone likes. Studying the settings people used and trying to recreate shots that others had taken. I spent far too long picking through Instagram to find shots for places I was due to visit. Looking for the right angles and interesting things to look at. I learnt a lot, but it ruined my motivation for photography for a while because I always felt I didn’t live in an interesting enough place.</p>
<p>Like most things, Instagram is a photography version of comparing your <a href="/2021/05/31/insides-vs-outsides.html">insides to someone else’s outsides</a>. All I began to see was crystal clear, pin sharp images that had been edited perfectly, and my shots never looked like the ones I wanted to recreate. The reality is that I didn’t <a href="/2021/08/04/other-peoples-trash.html">see their trash can</a>, nor the times that tried to shoot things and missed, I just saw the best of the best. My shots were never going to live up to the standard I thought I should be at and that sucked.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c31fc74f30.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Thankfully, I quickly realised that I wasn’t taking shots for other people. I was taking them for me and wanted something different from everyone else anyway. An easy way to do this was to take pictures of things, rather than capturing moments. I began to focus on things that caught my eye and rare moments that were unlikely to be seen again. Unfortunately, this can lead to instances where I only gain a handful of shots I am happy with despite hours of shooting. Or more often than I care to admit, they all went in the bin!</p>
<p>As my interests change to street photography, the chances of poor outings increase dramatically, so my motivation can take a hit occasionally. That doesn’t mean I will stop taking them, though. That one shot I am pleased with is worth the grind of getting nothing at all.</p>

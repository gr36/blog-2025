  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>If you are a <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/cycling/">regular reader</a>, or subscribed <a href="https://gr36.com/greg-thinks-things-5/">the newsletter</a>, you will have noticed a change in me. It has been COVID–19 that has compelled people that start exercising or change the way they do it, but mine was a pretty annoying and painful injury. At the time it didn’t feel like it, but I am glad to say it is the best thing that has happened to me for a long time.</p>
<p>For more than 18 months I have been struggling with my health and fitness. I have always been pretty active, but unfortunately picking up injuries easily and suffering because I couldn’t exercise as much. Around 6 miles (ca. 10 km) into an otherwise average run my calf twinged horribly. I stopped to try to stretch it out, but to no relief and from lack of other options I had to walk/run/hobble the rest of the way home agonising.</p>
<p>This resulted in my calf being torn badly and I never really recovered fully until recently. As much as my wife tried to convince me this was because I am getting old, I found myself getting pretty upset about it. I couldn’t do much exercise for weeks, the only thing I could stand was indoor cycling and found that tedious, so didn’t do it very often. When I did get back to running I was very limited to around 5k before it started to hurting again.</p>
<p>I tried to push myself too much every so often which resulted in not being able to walk well or having to stay off it completely. Couple this with the associated issues with trying to recover, my gait was really affected and I started to get knee and lower back pain due to what I think was subconsciously compensating. This all came to a head just after Christmas with a nasty hip injury that made it difficult to walk sometimes.</p>
<p>So at the start of March, with no other choice I reluctantly pulled my road bike out the garage, dusted it off and started riding.</p>
<p>I absolutely hated every second of it. It was windy, cold, and I was desperately out of shape due to not all the injuries. I eventually managed to puff and blow myself around 16 km. I was annoyed at myself for being so unfit again, but buoyed at the realisation that I had no hip pain for the first time in weeks.</p>
<p>So, I got on again the next day, and the next day, and the day after that. Actually, I think I had some rest days in there at first — but you get the idea. Pushing myself a little further and working on my technique. Beginning to watch videos on beginners tips, and reading advice on bike servicing, cycling crept into my life.</p>
<p>I didn’t know then I was hooked, but when out for a ride a few days later I stumbled on hill that took everything out of me to get to the top. Upon and conquering it I knew this was it, something clicked and I fell in love.</p>
<p>Cycling has allowed me to do more than I ever imagined. It gives me not only a ridiculous workout with a lot less stress on my body, but it gives me time away. I ride for around 90mins each day and that’s my alone time with the world. Its made me happier, fitter, and a better runner than I ever could have been without getting on my bike. Getting injured was annoying, painful and slightly depressing, but I am better for it.<!--kg-card-end: html--></p>

<blockquote><p>Retail shopping is not needed for our survival. Of course, it never was. But it has been helpful to be reminded of that fact.<br />
Given the reality that most of our homes are filled with more possessions than at any point in human history (even after 2 months of stores being closed), buying stuff from the store is no longer about survival for most of us.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a stark difference in the people I talk to about their current life. Those that moan that they can’t do their normal things, and those that have realised that their normal life doesn’t have to come back.</p>
<p>Now is the time to change the way things are and loose this reliance on stuff to make you happy. It is people and experiences that have kept you going though this, and it is those same things that should keep you going forever.</p>
<p>Love people, not things. Use things, not people.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2020/05/18/how-i-use.html"><h1 class="p-name">How I use Todoist To Organise My Life</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>So. No apologies here, but I ripped off this idea directly from Matt Birchler’s write-up <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/how-i-use-things-3-to-organize-my-life/">on his Things set up</a>. Even though he is a strong believer in the ability of Things, and also everyone <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1261314996048363521">in the replies</a>seems to think the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/todoist-my-new-app-to-get-things-done/">Todoist</a> design is trash, I think very much that we have the same outlook on GTD. The basis of this revolves around “offloading your brain” so you can focus on other things.</p>
<p>I never set levels of tasks that I <em>HAVE</em> to get done each day, but I <em>DO</em> aim to get 3 main things ticked off each working day. This set up has been how I get everything done daily and also why I forget loads of meaningless stuff. I would love you all to give <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">Todoist a try here</a>. This isn’t a GTD set up, but it’s my set up and it all starts with the Inbox.</p>
<h2 id="inbox">Inbox</h2>
<p>More or less everything starts life in here. All my tasks from heavy-duty projects to simple reminders start life as a string of text in my inbox. Having tried almost all the major task managers, I am sure most people would agree that Todoist does it best for just dumping everything in and this is the reason why I struggle to take to any other app.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" title="Todoist-Setup-Screenshots-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8a6533ba1a.jpg" alt="Todoist Setup Screenshots 1" /></figure>
<p>Whenever any tasks arise I use the Mac shortcut or the widget on iOS to quickly add it to my inbox. If the task can be done straight away and within 5 minutes this is the only time it doesn’t get added because I will complete that task straight away. If I know when it needs to be done I can allocate the due date then in natural language and forget about it.</p>
<p>The power of being able to just type out something like “follow up with Geoff in 2 months #work” and never have to think about it again is the biggest thing that improves my productivity and also my mental health.</p>
<h2 id="moving-and-tagging">Moving And Tagging</h2>
<p>I have a recurring task to sort my Inbox at 7:30 every morning which is usually the time I am sitting down at my desk. I tried doing this as my last thing each day but it didn’t stick. My habits dictate I never leave work without having completed everything or moved things to the following day so this became the best way for me to pick anything up that has been missed or cropped up later.</p>
<p>The next stage of my to-dos life begins when this notification goes off. I then go through all of my tasks, allocating them due dates and times and moving them to projects. As with the Inbox, if I can do this straight away and within 5–10 minutes I will do this task and cross it off. So, not every task lives a long life or makes it any further than my inbox.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>I don’t use Projects as Todoist intend, or indeed how any task manager apps think you will use it. This is simply because I never really have many large scale projects to complete. I have just a few that I use more like areas that my task relates to. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-Off tasks – anything that I need to get done and that’s the end of it. Most home things end up here.</li>
<li>Work – most of my stuff ends up here, small or large tasks to get done. Going forward my team will move to a shared Task managing platform, so we can allocate things, but at the moment this is just me.</li>
<li>Routines – Anything that is reoccurring such as put the bin out, read my meters, set my Strava goals for the week.</li>
<li>Creative – any writing tasks or newsletter projects I want to complete. These usually contain a link to the relevant Ulysses Sheet.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" title="Todoist-Upcoming-Mac-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d86b4e6789.jpg" alt="Todoist Upcoming Mac 1" /></figure>
<h2 id="the-upcoming-screen">The Upcoming Screen</h2>
<p>This is where I spend most of my time, with the upcoming screen (previously next 7 days) of the Mac app open. This gives me an overview of the next few days, and allows me to put in times if I need to and arrange my day fully. There is never a time that a task doesn’t have a due date, so this screen gives me everything.</p>
<p>I am not afraid to push something if other things crop up so from this screen I can just drag a task to another day, but also add tasks for other days effortlessly. Before the upcoming screen I found myself switching between areas depending on what I was doing, so now things are much more streamlined. I have a calendar subscription <a href="https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/208789889-Use-Todoist-with-your-calendar">set up for an overview</a> if I am not sat at my desk, this works really well with the Stock iOS app.</p>
<h2 id="little-tricks">Little Tricks</h2>
<p>I have picked up some little things over the few years I have been using Todoist that really help me. These don’t fit into any area but are worth sharing anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li>Event Tickets – if I am going anywhere I save a PDF of the tickets (either the email or the web conformation) attach this to a reminder that pops up and the event start time. That way I am not searching my emails when I get there.</li>
<li>Morning Tag – This is a new one stolen from Matt, but is working very well. Instead of trying to guess times, anything that I want to do first thing I allocate a Morning tag to.</li>
<li>Drag in Emails – If you use Apple Mail on Mac or iPadOS you can <a href="https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/206522639-How-can-I-use-Todoist-with-Apple-Mail-">drag in an email as a Todoist item</a>and it will link straight to it. Mind Blown.</li>
<li>Browser extension – <a href="https://doist.com/blog/hidden-features-todoist/#add_article">Get this</a> to save any Safari links you need to refer to.</li>
<li>Due dates based on last completed date – If you want to set a reoccurring reminder for a length of time after that last one use a ! After the every. For example, “task every! week” will create a task one week after you complete the last one.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>
<p>There are a few things that I do desire from Things. None of these are critical, I wouldn’t say I miss them, but would help for my specific use case.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create Project – There are times when I create items that then turn into a much larger project. I currently have to copy these into a new project, but in Things the option exists to create one from an item.</li>
<li>Someday – I long for this to be an option in Todoist. I just like to dump longer term things into here and leave them to plan later. I have tried to do something similar with tags but it just never really stuck.</li>
<li>Start Dates – oh boy this is a big one. I want to be able to set a start date for some tasks that take a while or are easier done slowly over time such as writing my newsletter. Currently, I have to set a “start newsletter” task and then another “finish newsletter” task. I would love to set it as a current task or ongoing task in Upcoming.</li>
<li>Calendar Items – Another big one I would love is to see upcoming calendar events in the Upcoming screen, so I can work my tasks around meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The End</p>
<p>There are a ridiculous number of apps and services I have tried, and I still get suckered into new ones all the time. However, Todoist works well for me, and has <a href="https://gr36.com/todoist-my-new-app-to-get-things-done/">done for years</a>. My set up has gone through so many changes that it doesn’t resemble anything like what I started with and will probably change in the future. The great thing is that <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">Todoist is available everywhere</a>, and is improving all the time.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">Todoist</a> and share your set up <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@gr36%20here's%20my%20Todoist%20set%20up">with me</a>.</p>

<p>I think I hate the internet. I mean it’s great as an idea, and all the things we can do with it are fantastic. As with everything it is the humans that access it that spoil everything. With great communication tools, comes a great influx of idiots, many that think their opinion, however toxic, should be shoved in peoples faces if they like it or not.</p>
<p>Matt Birchler published a few graphs (<a href="https://gr36.com/charty-app-overview/">not sure if made with Charty</a>) around COVID cases in the US a few days ago. It was a great post, very insightful and well thought out, yet the first thought I had when reading it was “I bet he’ll regret writing that”. I expected the reply guys to pile in on mass and argue about it.</p>
<p>There are numerous times I have had an idea for a post and not written it because I simply can’t be doing with people tweeting back at me. I am all up for debate, but Twitter especially seems to stimulate a certain type of ‘person’. I say person but I think some are bots, or fake accounts, and have some kind of usage beyond just annoying people. However some of this is people, people that I used to respect.</p>
<p>The replies to this post were not too bad, but Matt wrote the next day <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/a-perpetual-hate-machine/">about his struggles</a> with fools online. Receiving death threats because of comparisons between Pixel and iPhone cameras is wildly insane, but shouldn’t stop me from writing anything. I <em>might</em> regret writing a post, but I <em>do</em> experience regret at not writing things often.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Wahoo-Element-Bolt-Hero..jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a3ede37870.jpg" alt="Wahoo Element Bolt Hero" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<p>I know exactly what you’re thinking. What exactly is this thing and how can I use this with my iPad? Well, this is something completely different, something I use for my new love cycling, but it’s still a gadget and well worth a review. So here are my thoughts on the Wahoo Element Bolt from my relatively new to cycling point of view.</p>
<p>There are loads of opinions out there already about what bit of kit to get to display your cycling info. Wahoo Element Bolt reviews are mainly written by almost professional cyclists, so I hoping my opinions and thoughts fit in somewhere for those of us not putting out unbelievable times. Indeed technology like this isn’t new, but its leaps and bounds above what was capable only a few years ago. From my novice experience of riding, this is my first computer since those cheap little boxes that you had to attach a magnet to your spokes, but when considering upping your game and spending a bit more time in the saddle there are only two things to consider.</p>
<h2>Tracking All The Things</h2>
<p>Do you want to track everything with your phone, and if not, do you buy a Garmin or a Wahoo? The more established Garmin has plenty of fans, but the real attraction for me was the huge battery life leap from the Wahoo, and the relatively cheep price. Yes this thing is going to set you back around £190, but it gives you an all singing all dancing cycle computer that should last you years.</p>
<p>The normal metrics are on board. Screens can be customised to show you speed, time, distance, power, heart rate, elevation and many more. So purists can see this live, review it later and export all the information their heart desires. That wasn’t why I bought this though. I am pretty sure that’s not why anyone would spend this kind of money on a training aid, because it can be done cheaper. Really the beauty of the Wahoo Element Bolt is its integrations with tools that make your cycling better.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Wahoo-Element-Bolt-Screens-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0ca2636195.jpg" alt="Wahoo Element Bolt Screens 1" width="1157" height="372" border="0" /></p>
<p>It offers turn by turn navigation, live tracking links to share with friends, route planning and wireless connection to a whole range of other products. This little black box has very quickly become one of my favourite things. Not because it gives me power output and speed information, because it lets me plan my route ahead of time and tells me where to go.</p>
<p>It has taken me from doing the same old routes to exploring more and finding my way around with confidence. I knew my local back roads very little considering I have lived here for more than 10 years, but using the companion app or online services live Strava, I can plot out a ride and complete it with much less stress. I am sure all the analytics displayed are important to those more deeply into cycling, but that’s just not me at the moment.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Image-15-05-2020-08-39-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5d6cfa2a36.jpg" alt="Image 15 05 2020 08 39 1" width="2000" height="955" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Smart Connection</h2>
<p>Initial setup of the Wahoo Element Bolt requires very little user input, but it does require a smartphone to set it up on first boot. After using it for signing in and setting up, you will also need the companion app connected if you want to customise anything. This wont be an issue for almost anyone but unfortunately as with all companion apps, it is terribly designed. Thankfully the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elemnt-companion-app-for-wahoo/id1049469683?mt=8">Element app</a> is very easy to use and understand. Here you can also connect your Wahoo Element Bolt to other services such as Strava, Komoot and even Apple Health on iOS.</p>
<p>You can also connect the Wahoo Element to other Bluetooth and WiFi extras such as heart rate monitors, power sensors and loads of other options. If like me you have the Shimano DI2 with wireless you can even set up the two buttons on the shifters to change pages on the Wahoo. You can connect it to just about anything and any service imaginable.</p>
<p>Using Apple Health to triage all of your rides is a great tool, and counts towards your daily move goal as long as you sync through Strava. For some reason I couldn’t get the Wahoo Element app to give Apple Health any calorie information, yet Strava does <a href="https://gr36.com/strava-record-calories-apple-health/">after a bit of setup</a>. Unless you need to change the screens of the unit or check for an update reliance on the smartphone app is minimal if you use other services such as Strava. Allowing customisation through the app is a clever decision and removes the need for a touchscreen on the unit meaning interaction is done by good old trusty buttons.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Wahoo-Element-Bolt-Review-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8351033557.jpg" alt="Wahoo Element Bolt Review 1" width="2000" height="1125" border="0" /></p>
<p>This is great if you live somewhere like the UK and need to wear gloves often. The three buttons on the front and two on the side allow for changing pages of information or zooming in and out of the displayed navigation map. The screen is bright and easy to read whatever the weather. Despite being criticised as only being black and white I think this is the right decision for ease of use.</p>
<p>If you are the type of rider that takes your phone out with you so you stay connected, the Wahoo Element Bolt will also flash up messages and phone calls if you wish. Meaning you will still be contactable when out and about. The screen will show a preview of any messages, with customisable sound and LED alerts to something that needs your attention.</p>
<p>The strip of LEDs across the top can also be customised to alert you to different kinds of things. From Strava sections, to navigation alerts or your training metrics you want to highlight. This unit really does have it all for beginners to elite athletes.</p>
<h2>Better By Design</h2>
<p>Wahoo have made several design choices when producing the Element Bolt that all play together to build a complete package. Decisions such as the black and white screen don’t detract from the unit in anyway, save battery life and increase the visibility when out cycling. Something that may seem like a ‘con’ when compared to much of the Garmin range is actually the right decision.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="bolt_aero-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a3d3bd4696.jpg" alt="Bolt aero 1" width="600" height="294" border="0" /></p>
<p>This rings even more true when you consider that battery life is absolutely insane. I have never used an alternative, however Wahoo claim it is up to 300% better than the Garmin 520 and even a 3 hour ride while navigating clips the battery by only 40%. Given the size of the Wahoo Element Bolt, that is pretty amazing battery life.</p>
<p>Wahoo have also thought about the Aerodynamics of the unit when designing. Claiming 50% less drag than competitors, with a sleek and all in one deign that clips safe and secure to its holder with zero fuss. I’m not looking to shave seconds off my ride here, but I appreciate something well designed and doesn’t look like you’ve attached a huge tablet to your handlebars. The Wahoo Element Bolt will pretty much go unnoticed when you don’t need it, but provide everything when you do.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With all of this packed into hardware that Wahoo claims has 50 percent less drag than a Garmin Edge 520, and triple the battery life there isn’t a lot not to love. If your buying this to shave off a few seconds in a time trial, its got you covered. If indeed your training had reached it peak and you need another push forward, this will help. However if you need something to help you get out and about a bit more and help you along the way as an enthusiast then the Wahoo Element Bolt is pretty perfect too.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2020/05/15/how-to-set.html"><h1 class="p-name">How To Set Up Strava To Record Calories In Apple Health</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>After switching from recording my cycling on the Apple Watch to a <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/wahoo-element-bolt/">Wahoo Element</a> Bolt my activity levels seemed to suck. After previously smashing my move goals I was left short on some days even after a reasonable ride. Simply because Strava wasn’t calculating my calories and it took me ages to find out why.</p>
<p>After a few days of Googling around and finding all sorts of weird information I <a href="https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360039627911-Apple-Watch-App-not-counting-calories">eventually discovered a fix</a>. I tracked the issue down to a really simple one, but something that isn’t immediately obvious — you need to make sure that Strava has your weight and your bikes weight recorded.</p>
<p>You can only do all of this on the website and not the mobile app, so make sure you can log in on the web. Your weight is changeable in the app to your profile, but you can’t add or customise your gear for some reason. You will need to log in online, create your bike, and make sure you also give it a weight. A rough guess is fine but you can usually track down the correct weight with a quick search of the manufactures website.</p>
<p>Once this is competed your new runs and bike rides will contain calorie information that will be passed to Apple Health. If you want to get this for older rides, just tap edit activity and then save it again. This will pass the last few days worth of activity back to Apple Health but not all of it, and it’s temperamental at best with syncing.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" title="Image-15-05-2020-08-52-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/871c0624ed.jpg" alt="Image 15 05 2020 08 52 1" /></figure>
<p><br />This should mean you are getting all of the credit for your rides going forward. It’s surprising how addictive filling your rings on your Apple Watch is, and Apple Health makes it easy to share your activity data if a medical issue requires it. Strava is great for keeping all your rides logged, but keep it in other places too just in case you want to switch at a later date.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s been more than 14 days since I received my Magic Keyboard. The time has flown by and I hadn’t even realised it had been this long until I checked back on my post history. Two weeks that seems like the blink of an eye, and the biggest compliment I can give this keyboard is I have not regretted it once.</p>
<p>I sat down to write a full review about a week ago after seeing a few start to pop up such as <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/magic-keyboard-review/">Matt Birchler’s post</a> and really struggled to write it. You see, the best thing about a bit of technology that is exactly what you want, is that nothing stands out. There are no downsides, there are no emotions and very little to say bar “its great”.</p>
<p>My second problem with writing a full review is that I wrote so many words (1143) in <a href="https://gr36.com/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-forst-impressions/">my hands on</a> and very few have changed. I’ve never written so many after so little time before, simply because all of the feels I had about the device came at once. After all, this is only a keyboard, what is there to write about?</p>
<p>In fact there are loads of things I can talk about, which I already have, but things boil down to only a few points you need to consider if deciding to buy this thing.</p>
<h2>The Weight</h2>
<p>It is surprisingly heavy. Using it does bump the weight of the overall device to around the same as a MacBook. In exchange it is perfectly balanced and feels like a proper keyboard (more on this in a moment). It sits on my lap on the couch or in bed and gives me a laptop when I need it.</p>
<h2>Ease Of Use</h2>
<p>The keyboard is ridiculously easy to remove when needed. Mine has spent its time unfolded on my desk when I am using my iPad as a tablet. The magnets are safe and secure, but easy to snap off when you need to, giving a much better experience than keyboard cases that clip all the way around the body. You wont want to keep it attached all the time, and you wont have to.</p>
<p>I moaned a little about a function row of keys, but haven’t needed them at all. There may not be a key to adjust the key brightness but I am happy to report there doesn’t need to be. I have never ventured into settings once in any light condition and trust the software to do its thing.</p>
<h2>Typing</h2>
<p>The most important thing is what it feels like. I have never not liked the Smart Folio or Smart Keyboard before it, but the Magic Keyboard is a different beast entirely. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/the_ipad_magic_keyboard">Gruber summed it up best</a> when he described previous attempts iPad keyboards as covers you can type on. There was nothing wrong with these versions, I used them very happily for a long time. Whereas this is a proper, full sized keyboard with backlight and decent key travel. It is a delight to type on. I would be hard pushed to find fault with the typing experience, it even rivals the Mac Magic Keyboards which are my favourite for writing.</p>
<h2>Wants For The Future</h2>
<p>There are very few complaints from me, this simply doesn’t feel like a first generation device like it should. Many of my immediate concerns have gone, and even those pointed towards the <a href="https://thedent.net/grimegate/">outer material and GrimeGate</a> are short lived and the pretty much the same as previous versions.</p>
<p>If i could be really picky, I’d love for the charging port to also be able to transfer data, but that’s a small want. All these words are to say that i am very happy with my purchase, the Magic Keyboard has meant I have ditched my MacBook and made me fall in love with the iPad again — well done Apple.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>If you’ve followed me for a while, you will already know my love of <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/automation/">iOS automation</a>. I am not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8raOG7HXJoCUygx219fU4A">Chris Lawley</a> level of obsessed, but anything to make my daily life easier and I am all in! Shortcuts (and before that Workflow) is by far my favourite app for doing this, but the real beauty of Shortcuts is all the apps it plugs into. Almost everything on your home-screen can be automated, and a whole lot more. New app Charty is aiming to remove the hassle of creating graphs and charts, and launches today.</p>
<p>This is one of those apps that at first you dismiss, but when actually looking around the app you realise just how helpful it can be. That’s because developer Rodrigo Araújo has thought about almost every aspect of the app. Building on the success of his first app <a href="https://chatstats.app/">ChartStat</a> he aims to make it easy for everyone to visualise any kind of data.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Image-06-05-2020-07-57-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/31f2dfd6b3.jpg" alt="Image 06 05 2020 07 57 1" width="599" height="286" border="0" />There are 27 examples already included in the app ready to be imported into Shortcuts. These powerful Shortcuts can plot data you probably already have on your phone but don’t really look at that often. Displaying them in any of the available 5 different types – bar, line, scatter, pie and donut.</p>
<p>From there it is amazingly easy to create powerful algorithms that process and create your visualisations from inside Shortcuts. The really great things is that now you can begin to not only collect and store data using Shortcuts, but also combine it with utilities such as <a href="https://datajar.app/">DataJar</a> to build really powerful tools.</p>
<p>I have been using this quite a bit to plot out my heart rate changes over time, and my distance cycled due to my attempt to get fitter. The graphs in Apple Health are very restrictive so I am over the moon this app makes it easy for me to compare and highlight fitness issues. The graphs are amazingly customisable so I see exactly what I am exporting. I can then send these wherever I like to save and refer back to later.</p>
<p>In my limited use the app has already proved really helpful. Everyone should give it a go just for the amazing alternative icons. With that said I expect to see <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/update-on-the-ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-charging-speed-45w-charger-tested/">Matt Birchler</a> really putting this to work over the next few weeks — he loves a graph!</p>
<p>Charty is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/charty-for-shortcuts/id1494386093">available now</a> for free with 4 Shortcut actions available — New Chart, Add Series To Chart, Delete Chart and Get Information From All Chart. You can upgrade the app for a one off payment of $4.99 to get extra shortcuts actions as well as a whole load of extras, but if you purchase this within the first month of release it will only be $2.99.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I know Apple marketing is great but we need to have a little chat about the Magic Keyboard because I think they may have sold you a lie. You see, despite it being pretty great the keyboard Apple sold you isn’t really magic.</p>
<p>I am not sure what you expected to happen when you attached a keyboard complete with backlight keys and a trackpad to an iPad but it was never going to turn it into a Mac. The way that some people have spoken about the keyboard seems that they expected some kind of OTA update once you connected it, and that the iPad all of sudden wasn’t an iPad anymore.</p>
<p>Yet here we are debating everything negative about a device that isn’t supposed to do what you want it to. While the comparisons to the surface are somewhat valid, to say that Windows tablets do it better is simply not true. Windows tablets are laptops stuffed into a tablet form fact and made to work — whereas the iPad is the reverse. It’s pretending to be a Laptop, but its not pretending to be a Mac.</p>
<p>I can’t help but think that if the iPad was made by someone else we wouldn’t even be making these comparisons to a Mac, and indeed that some of the evangelical aspects of iOS would be removed. As this <a href="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1255718156238118913?s=21">eloquent tweet storm</a> points out there are some points that feel like you have to agree to an iPad philosophy. That in order to really ‘get’ the iPad you have to devote your life to praising its positives and shift your whole workflow in order to use it Working on iOS feels like a badge of honour that people wear, and become strangely evangelical at every point.</p>
<p>The fact remains. Are you making the iPad a worse tablet because you attach a Magic Keyboard. Of course you are. You’re attaching a keyboard that effectively turns the iPad into a laptop and some how that is surprising? Yet you can remove the tablet easily and use it as a tablet once again. If your expecting a keyboard that is lighter and can remain on when you want to use it as a tablet — good news <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MXNK2B/A/smart-keyboard-folio-for-ipad-pro-11%E2%80%91inch-2nd-generation-british-english">Apple sell that kind of keyboard</a> too.</p>
<p>As the old saying goes a “Jack of all trades is a master of none”. Attaching a keyboard to the iPad does not make it a master Laptop, better options exist. Attaching a Pencil does not make it a master drawing tablet, better options exist. Plugging the iPad into an exerting display… you get the idea. The iPad cannot be all things to all people. But its doing a bloody good job of giving people a tablet when they want it. Turning into a sudo-laptop when they want it, and also being capable of ridiculously powerful tasks when you need them.</p>

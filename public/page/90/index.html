<blockquote><p>TheDigitalHacker team observed the screenshot and found that the user, in fact, didn’t mention the context “video call” at all in the conversation but google’s own developed messaging app Messages added “Start Video Call” button positioning their own app “Google Duo” first in the chat. The user also had zoom android app installed on his phone.“</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>This raises many questions regarding google’s anti-competitive behavior towards companies like zoom, skype, and other companies in the video conferencing industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mathew Wille writing for Input <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/google-adds-sketchy-duo-link-when-zoom-is-mentioned-on-android">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>That strategy is likely to turn customers away, rather than reel them back in.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem is don’t think this makes any difference to users. They just ignore it and carry in regardless. Even If (and that’s a very big if) Google got fined for this, it’s such a small hit to take to their bottom line it’s almost unnoticeable when they look to gain millions of users a week.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong this is a. absolutely deplorable tactic by Google, but one I am not surprised in the slightest. Google’s business model is to sell you stuff, or sell you Google services, which it then uses to sell you stuff. So this shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p>
<p>The real shocker is average users don’t care.</p>

<p>Updated: Added in non-jQuery code snippet</p>
<p>This problem is a reasonably simple one if you know what you are doing with writing Javascript. Unfortunately, I am not, and this feels like an issue that shouldn’t need some script, but here we are.</p>
<p>After loads of Googling, looking at Github Gist, and trial and error, I finally found a solution to opening new links in a new tab thanks to <a href="https://www.insidersbyte.com/open-external-links-in-a-new-tab-by-default-ghost/">InsidersByte</a>.</p>
<p>As they point out you can do this with markdown or adding in <code>target=_blank</code> to the end of each Url, but who has time for that? So add this into the footer of your site.</p>
<p>With jQuery</p>
<pre><code class="language-jQuery">
var links = document.links;</code></pre>
<p>for (var i = 0, linksLength = links.length; i &lt; linksLength; i++) {
 if (links[i].hostname != window.location.hostname) {
 links[i].target = '_blank';
 }
}</p>
<p>non-jQuery</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
 var links = document.querySelectorAll(‘a’);
 links.forEach((link) =&gt; {
 var a = new RegExp(‘/’ + window.location.host + ‘/’);
 if(!a.test(link.href)) {
 link.addEventListener(‘click’, (event) =&gt; {
 event.preventDefault();
 event.stopPropagation();
 window.open(link.href, ‘_blank’);
 });
 }
 });
</code></pre>
<p>You could do this in your theme template if you like, but the easiest way is to head to your dashboard, and then Settings &gt; Code Injection. Copy and paste in the code and remember to save!</p>
<p>Reload your site, and you should be sorted.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I fancy myself as a bit of an enlightened person, and spend a lot of <a href="https://gr36.com/i-spend-too-much-time-alone/">time on my own</a> thinking. Running ideas through my head and working out conclusions, or simply letting my imagination run wild. This works pretty well for creativity, and is where most of my blog posts come from. I enjoy it so much that I’m convinced boredom should be a skill learnt in school.</p>
<p>Whilst walking the dog, running, or after everyone else has gone to sleep I often just sit alone with my thoughts and ideas. Sounds weird doesn’t it, but during one such period of silence I was thinking about my thoughts and decisions on the <a href="https://gr36.com/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-forst-impressions/">Magic Keyboard</a> and the criticism faced. It’s great to test technology and see where it fits into your life, I quite often make room in order to fit them in, but it’s just as valid to decide they are simply not for you.</p>
<p>So when I came across a post by <a href="https://nahumck.me/this-is-not-for-me/">Tim Nuhumk on the Magic Keyboard</a> I was surprised how many words went half way towards apologising for his thoughts, and I would presume there may have been a worry about some backlash against him. I love Tim, and all of his writing, but his thoughts expressed in his posts are not him as a person.</p>
<p>How many times do you hold ideas and beliefs so rigidly that they become part of your being. Defending them with the same visceral energy that could be called fight or flight. This is not the case with Tim’s post above, this was purely where the idea sprung from whilst thinking about Apple related topics. Infact I am certainly guilty of this more often than not. Just because someone is testing or even better breaking down your ideas, does not mean they are breaking down you. You are not your thoughts, beliefs or ideas.</p>
<p>An idea becomes stronger when you hold it up to be tested. When pressure is applied and the idea resists is when they grow, develop and improve. If they do indeed break, that’s perfectly ok. You do not need to hold your ideas so close and tenderly as if they are glass, because then they will surely break.</p>
<p>If others test your ideas and beliefs they are not testing you as a person. It’s perfectly ok to have apposing views and still like the other person — in fact some of my closest friends are so close because they give me different ideas and apposing view points. Make your circle as diverse and as interesting as possible and you will be a better person because of it. Separate yourself from your ideas and you will feel much better.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I guess my posts over the past few weeks may have <a href="https://twitter.com/crumpy/status/1252919281496530945?s=20">seemed like a reversal</a> after my rage <a href="https://gr36.com/today-is-the-day-i-quit-the-ipad/">quitting of the iPad</a> 6 months ago. Since announcing the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/03/apple-unveils-new-ipad-pro-with-lidar-scanner-and-trackpad-support-in-ipados/">new version</a> alongside the Magic Keyboard Apple got me interested again, and wondering if I could return. So I guess I should explain myself.</p>
<p>In actual fact I never stopped <a href="https://gr36.com/the-ipad-goes-full-circle/">owning an iPad</a>, I just didn’t want to work on one any longer. Indeed the upgrades to the iPad Pro are unimportant and haven’t changed the iPad much at all. I <em>was</em> interested in the <a href="https://gr36.com/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-forst-impressions/">Magic Keyboard</a> though and picked up a 2018 iPad Pro to go with it despite the Magic Keyboard shipping much later. For the majority of this time it has been a consumption device and living alongside my iMac as a sidecar screen or displaying extra info.</p>
<p>In order to see if anything has changed in my thoughts, I went back and pulled the most important statements out of the old post and compared them to my feelings now.</p>
<blockquote><p>During my time working on the iPad I always needed a Mac around to podcast and edit things properly – you know do real work.</p></blockquote>
<p>I no longer podcast at all and have sold all of my equipment. So I need a Mac around even less than before. Currently I am working from my home on my work iMac Pro – but going forward I don’t want a desktop around when I hopefully <a href="https://gr36.com/my-set-up-and-want-for-more/">change up my set up as planned</a>. So this point no longer applies to me, but still does to some. The iPad still needs to improve these ‘Pro’ apps to get everything done.</p>
<blockquote><p>Then iOS13 arrived. I cant point to one specific event or one particular bug, but iOS13 has been like death by a million paper cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Things have improved in this department. Sync of my Apple Notes and random app crashes have moved forward considerably. iOS13 is still not up to scratch in my opinion. Still retaining things like the annoying rotation bug for iPads — but it is not nearly as unreliable as it was. I still have some issues placing my trust in Apple to maintain this, simply because I rely so much on apps and Shortcuts. It takes a while to win this trust back and invest in iOS again, but things look positive.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is all after spending weeks getting my head around the new multitasking and app pairing because they changed the way the iPad worked AGAIN.</p></blockquote>
<p>Please don’t change things again Apple. Not having to reach up to the screen when using a keyboard helps dramatically though and this is one of the big improvement that I am really happy about. No more shoulder pain when trying to use it as a laptop.</p>
<blockquote><p>The iPad lost its way somewhere in the last year or so and become a device that isn’t fit for me any more.</p></blockquote>
<p>The iPad is still a bit confused to me. Apple are not really sure what they want it to be but I have a feeling things are going to become clearer over the next 6months to a year. As more apps become universal and some of the line moves to ARM things will become easier to work out. I didn’t immediately spring for a 2020 iPad and picked up a 2018 version for a fraction of the price because my confidence is still shaken.</p>
<p>So although I am using an iPad Pro again very little of my opinions has changed. I might be using an iPad again but I am not putting my faith in working on one, yet.</p>

<blockquote><p>Google puts software downloadable outside of Google Play at a disadvantage, through technical and business measures such as scary, repetitive security pop-ups for downloaded and updated software, restrictive manufacturer and carrier agreements and dealings, Google public relations characterizing third party software sources as malware, and new efforts such as Google Play Protect to outright block software obtained outside the Google Play store.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t agree that anyone should give access to their customers away for free, but its time the standard 30% tax is looked at.</p>
<p>But the most important part fo this is that the long held belief that Android is open and you can do anything is fast disappearing. Google are pulling back on the reins and getting control of their platform. Which can only lead to a good things going forward – for Google anyway.</p>

<p>When is it too early to give your opinions on a product? This seems a pretty blurred line. Dependent a lot of the time on the type of review you want to give. It’s a debate for another time, because I have had my hands on the new Magic Keyboard for my 2018 iPad Pro for just a few hours and already have loads of thoughts to share — but a full review will follow later.</p>
<p>I have, for the most part, been avoiding the weirdly negative reviews and comparisons that focus on small issues blown out of proportion. As I covered in <a href="https://gr36.com/greg-thinks-things-3/">my newsletter</a>, I’ve been really excited to get this keyboard and it arrived a day later than it was supposed to. So I found myself consuming quite a few reviews to satiate my desire to use it. But that is not to say that if I had been forced to write this within the first hour or so of taking the Magic keyboard out the box my feelings would have been very different.</p>
<h2>It’s Heavy</h2>
<p>Let’s get this out the way straight away. Attaching the Magic Keyboard to your iPad Pro makes it heavier. Not just a bit heavier, there is a lot more weight and no avoiding this. This keyboard is not a Smart Keyboard by any stretch of the imagination. So if you’re looking for something similar you’re going to be very disappointed.</p>
<p>Many reviews have focused on this. While comparisons to the weight of laptops and other Windows variations are somewhat valid, they are a little logically flawed. Sure it’s about the same weight as a MacBook Pro, so is the argument that I should carry that instead? Whereas it’s down to the weight you want to carry. Without getting into the specs of the different machines and OS, there are some huge differences. I can’t take the screen off a MacBook, nor annotate a PDF by drawing on the screen, so we are not comparing Apples here. If I’m going to carry 3lb I will carry a 12.9” iPad and Magic Keyboard no question — whereas many others may not.</p>
<p>Now we have that out of the way, we can move on. There are numerous reasons for the weight of this accessory, which I wont go into here, but it ads a proper keyboard. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/the_ipad_magic_keyboard">Gruber summed it up best</a> when he described previous attempts iPad keyboards as covers you can type on. There was nothing wrong with these versions, I used them very happily for a long time. Whereas this is a proper, full sized keyboard with back light and decent key travel. With a trackpad thrown in for good measure. This is tiny when compared to any other Apple version but about the same size as everything else on the market. One thing to note is that it is <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1252541993063976962?s=20">ridiculously loud when clicking</a>.</p>
<p>The keyboard keys are’t quite as bad, but they are not far off. They give in my opinion a perfectly clicky feedback. With the right amount of movement in the keys to make typing a delight. Typing on them feels somewhere between the current Mac Magic Keyboard, with a little of the stiffness of the butterfly keyboard left in. But to be clear these are lovely scissor switches, so lets <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/557431/apple-finally-acknowledges-its-new-macbook-keyboards/">hope they last</a>.</p>
<p>I have no reason to think they wont, because everything about the unit feels premium and worth the money. Sure this <em>is</em> an expensive accessory, but in a world where the Smart Keyboard Folio is £199, for the extra £150 you get much more for your money. One of my initial trepidation’s was the rigidity of the keyboard when using it on my lap, but I am happy to report there is zero flex. Both of the hinges for positioning the iPad feel study and robust, clicking into place with reassuring tactile feedback.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="apple_ipad-pro-keyboard_now-available_04152020-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9a19a20761.jpg" alt="Apple ipad pro keyboard now available 04152020 1" width="600" height="520" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Screen Positioning</h2>
<p>The Magic Keyboard floating style is quintessentially Apple. Say what you want about a better design, but this screams designed in Cupertino. You’re going to see loads of these in coffee shops when we are allowed out again. That’s not to say the design is the right choice, thats a very personal opinion. It just looks like something Apple would do. The design also brings the iPad closer to your face which is a nice touch, saving some neck ache. The two hinges allow movement from 90 to 130 degrees.</p>
<p>This range of movement sounds like plenty depending on your usage. I am not getting into the whole drawing mode debate comparing to something that has never been advertised, but unfortunately it isn’t much movement at all. I feel as if the screen positions are almost as limiting as they were before. This isn’t going to bother <em>me</em> going forward and I completely understand why it is like this. However the furthest 130degree position is just about suitable for my needs and at this point  still feels a little top heavy when on my lap.</p>
<h2>Wants For The Future</h2>
<p>It is very early days in my usage, and despite my early disappointment I am happily typing away on it.</p>
<p>The Magic Keyboard feels very much like a first-gen product with some important lessons learnt from the covers that have gone before. There are design choices that have been made to get the best from the form factor. Ultimately boiling down to a few nitpicking details.</p>
<p>I’d love to see the power connector able to also transfer data so I don’t need any more dongles hanging out the side, but this would mean a redesign of the iPad technology rather than a better case.</p>
<p>I would also like to see the keyboard get a row of function keys or at the very least an FN key to perhaps use the numbered row. I don’t adjust the backlight to my keyboard very often, but when I do I expect it to be right in front of me along with volume control and screen brightness.</p>
<p>I will refrain from any major judgements just yet and save them for a full review, but there are surprisingly few things I would change, and none that put me off completely.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With all things said, this is the sort of keyboard I have always wanted for my iPad. The robustness of a proper keyboard was without doubt a limiting factor in previous years and one of the reasons I started using a Laptop again.</p>
<p>The iPad Pro Magic Keyboard is the best keyboard you can get for your iPad Pro but its far from perfect. This isn’t;t going to be for everyone. If you want a laptopesk experience on iOS then look no further. For anything else, move along.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I try and keep the <a href="https://gr36.com/gear">My Gear</a> page of the blog updated regularly, but I change my mind so many times and buy new things far too often. Indeed I am a bad minimalist, but I do try and make sure everything is sold before I buy something new. My current set up is a bit confused at the moment and it is stressing me out a little but at the same time I am amazingly grateful to be able to use such a range of stuff.</p>
<p>My main computer is an iMac Pro. I love working on it, it’s powerful, elegant and does everything I want it to. From my design work, to producing the occasional video and spending far too much time in the Adobe suite of apps it never misses a beat. At home I am currently using a 2017 5k iMac, which does most things but to be honest doesn’t get used much of the time. Mainly my wife is using it for her home working and my son does some school things on it.</p>
<p>I also carry around with me a 2019 MacBook Air for use in meetings and while travelling. I bought this when I rage quit using my <a href="https://gr36.com/today-is-the-day-i-quit-the-ipad/">iPad Pro 6 months ago</a>. I wont go into the reasons in here but the MacBook Air is great for note taking, meetings and other light tasks with fantastic battery life. The current situation doesn’t lend itself to me needing a laptop at the moment, so it is being used by a friend to work from home rather than sit in its box.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert, of course I bought an iPad again when the new ones came out, and I’m waiting with bated breath for the arrival of the Magic Keyboard. I wouldn’t say I went back to using an iPad solely because of the Magic keyboard but that and awesome set up <a href="https://thedent.net/my-ipad-pro-setup/">walkthroughs like Andy Nicolaides</a>, makes me want to do more with my set up. Things like the great AboveTEK Elegant Aluminium <a href="https://amzn.to/3eD9Wes">iPad Pro Stand</a> and also the addition of a proper laptop like keyboard allows my iPad to become more. As Federico Viticci points out, the iPad becomes a <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/">modular computer</a> when a supportive Eco-system exists around it.</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that I really <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1252228727418744835?s=20">enjoy writing on the iPad</a>, means that I don’t feel my MacBook Air will be around very long. However I want to do more with my set up to make this transition worth while. I don’t ever see myself working full time on an iPad but I may use it sometimes with an external monitor, which I can’t do with my current iMac. So where do I go from here?</p>
<p>My desire to make my set up <em>more</em> is also contrasted to my need to make my computer more discreet. A more minimal approach to my office would make me much more comfortable, as well as win me some Instagram points! I don’t like a great big iMac stuck on my desk, so I am leaning more towards something like the LG Ultra Fine or an ultra wide display which I could mount to a wall and also use with my Switch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the computing power and outlay of a Mac Mini isn’t pulling me in at the moment, but I guess never say never. It wouldn’t take much to out power my iMac but I’d love something that can do things more easily. Or maybe I just have massive FOMO — who knows.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The negativity is increasing by the day. If you can’t feel it growing when you talk to others, it’s pretty easy to see by the style of posts on the internet. They have slowly changed from helpful working at home tips to instructions or <a href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2020-04-17/working-from-home-regular-work-wardrobe-dress-up">ridicule of others</a> that are doing whatever they need to get by. There is absolute nothing wrong with what you are doing, there no precedent for this.</p>
<p>I’ve seen people seek more attention than normal. I’ve seen people disappear. I’ve seen people claim more appreciation they should do, and avoid all the validation they should get. I’m hopeful that most people don;t care and are doing their own thing — but you need to know you can do whatever you need to get you through.</p>
<p>Marketing emails and every advert on TV are telling us these are uncertain times. That’s because we have never faced anything like this before. In the UK we may well have faced two word wars and our country being in all sorts of weird situations. However we’ve never placed so much faith in healthcare, science and the people that work in those fields that ever before. It’s scary.</p>
<p>Listen to me when we say you can’t do exactly what you want. You can’t go against advice as show your entitlement by protesting closures. But you can do whatever you need to get you through these tough times.</p>
<p>Some will try and put you down and say you need to be productive, learn new skills, or downright dictate what you should wear. But you need to know it’s ok to show your opinions and it’s totally ok to do as you wish as long as you come out strong. If there are possible to take away I am confident that people will come out of this better, tougher and more focused than ever to do things that are good for you and the people around you.</p>
<p>Be kind to others. Be kind to yourself. Look after everyone you can. Listen to advice and take it on board. Most of all though wash you dam hands and stay home.</p>

<p>Josh Ginter <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/the-2020-ipad-pro/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 12.9-inch iPad Pro excels on a desk, but grinds to a halt everywhere else. I haven’t picked up or walked around with the big iPad Pro in about six months and haven’t read with it on the couch in even longer. I often use the big iPad Pro at the office to digitally sign PDFs, but even that feels like a rewrite of all those clipboard adventures from sixth grade science class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just can’t agree with this at all. I understand that a bigger iPad means you have to make allowances and it isn’t as portable as the 11” version. However that doesn’t mean it “grinds to a halt everywhere else”. I read on my iPad most days sat on the couch or in bed catching up on RSS feeds or reading lists.</p>
<p>I also know many others that do the same, so making this sweeping statement is a little strange. I agree with the point that most people should buy the smaller version, but when I <a href="https://gr36.com/moving-to-the-bigger-ipad/">switched the the larger one</a> I have never looked back.</p>
<p>I am currently using my 12.9” iPad for absolutely everything and cant wait to get my hands on the <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1250473014304612360?s=20">magic keyboard</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ironically, so much of the web is good at having RSS feeds that it was hard for me to find a use for this right away. I eventually figured out that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/nintendo-switch-new-releases/">the new releases page on Nintendo’s eShop</a> was a site I went to somewhat regularly just to see if anything new was there. I was able to save that URL as a web feed and now I’m getting updates as soon as new games are added. It’s pretty nice!</p></blockquote>
<p>Inoreader seem to always be on the cutting edge of what they can do. and one of the services I love using. They allow you to add in email newsletters and now also track pages that don’t have an RSS feed.</p>
<p>Like Matt above I really struggled to find a page I’d want to track – I tried the apple site and it didn’t work either!</p>
<p>Also you can only do this in their own apps, which is understandable, but I use Reeder so it’s pretty much useless to me.</p>

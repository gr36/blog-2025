  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Last month, I wrote a post that never got published. It was written out, formatted, edited and ready to go. As far as I could take it, but I hovered over the publish button and decided against it. There was nothing controversial there, but it criticised a poor take from someone who is well liked, and I couldn’t do doing with the hassle of replies.</p>
<p>In many respects, the unpublished post in question did its job. Much like the others that I get halfway through and never finish. It got the thoughts out and on to ‘paper’ instead of swirling in my head. The self-censorship didn’t lose me anything, and perhaps gained me a lot of peace, but I still find it funny that I couldn’t publish it on my blog. A space that is reserved for me to reflect on the things I want to write about.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6d3290fb62.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I repeat, there was nothing offensive in the post, simply a retort to the terrible take. The issue that I foresaw was who it was towards. If you offend the community in question, then tend to swarm and reply in droves. All putting in their opinion, even when not asked, which is great, up to a point. I felt as if I wanted to publish it without seeing it anywhere else, perhaps if it were kept away from the blog&rsquo;s main feed it could still live — but that defeats the point.</p>
<p>As such, it just sat there, doing nothing and annoying me, so I deleted it today and this post is my cathartic release instead. In both deleting the post and publishing this one, I have balanced my blogging chi, but there is still some weirdness there for me. I think that perhaps social media makes it too easy to reply, and too easy for me to read them.</p>
<p>If the reply took effort to reach out to me personally, or write their own blog post, this may put off even the most motivated of people. Even then, it would be very unlikely that I would see it without visiting their blog directly. I have had these <a href="/2020/04/16/one-week-with.html">protracted discussions before with fellow bloggers</a> through link posts, and they generally go down much better than those thrown at me in 280 characters.</p>

      <p>Adam Newbold, writing about using <a href="https://notes.neatnik.net/2024/02/url-as-a-sentence">URL as a sentence</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>URLs convey valuable information, and good URL design ensures that they provide the right level of context and set proper expectations. Incidentally, good URL design is something that is still lacking all over the internet,</p></blockquote>
<p>I can’t remember where I saw Adam&rsquo;s post linked to, nut it had the exact pull quote highlighted and I saved the post for reading later, thinking this was a fascinating idea. Something I could get behind. But the more I thought about it, the more I think it doesn’t really matter — which I think by the end Adam also agrees with.</p>
<p>I understand the idea. Maximising the amount of information in the URL, but on the modern web I don’t think it matters. I mean hey, it matters to Adam and that’s really cool, but in general. When was the last time you paid attention to a URL?</p>
<p>I link to loads of them, both on my blog and in my day job, and there are only two instances they matter. Both of which are every niche and only matter to me in my day job — SEO and direction.</p>
<ul>
<li>SEO: There is a held belief that they matter to SEO — I’m no expert, but I think they matter a lot less than they used to.</li>
<li>Direction: To get people to a URL, it’s important they are short and memorable.</li>
</ul>
<p>In every other instance, you’d be hard pushed if you even see the URL on the modern web (and perhaps that is another point worth talking about at a later post). Most browsers hide them and only show you the top-level domain. When it comes to sharing on the web, even platform either obscures them with their own linking and/or shows you a rich preview with an image.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am wrong and they really matter to people. I understand it’s essential to own them, and not change them, but as for what they look like — who cares. Well, Adam does clearly, do you?</p>

      <p>Can I quote post, a quote post? Well, tough, I am. Matt Birchler <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/we-turned-dunking-into-a-sport/">talking about dunking on people being a sport</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…a surefire way for you to generate engagement this week is to talk shit about…</p></blockquote>
<p>The first thing that comes to mind reading Matt’s post is the outline of all the performative behaviour that happens on social media. Big brands and users alike farming the rage of other people for attention. There’s nothing that seems to get people going than when they hate something you like, or like something you hate.</p>
<p>As I’ve written about before, of course <a href="/2021/06/12/hate-what-you.html">hate what you hate</a>, and embrace it, but there becomes a line when, as Matt writes about, your personality is outlined more by the things you hate than what you enjoy. You are more concerned about the external things that you should hate, than the internal, there becomes a little too much <em>you</em> in f^%k you.</p>
<p>Derren Brown talks about exactly this in the first part of his excellent book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473526853">Happy</a>. If you base your personality on doing the opposite of something, anything, you are giving up control. He uses the example of walking on the right side of the road, simply because everyone else uses the left. It might seem anti-establishment until everyone walks on the right now. Do you then cross the road?</p>
<p>Arcing back to Matt’s post, he have all been teenagers and disliking the right things was “cool”. It’s an important part of growing up, but why look at other people so much? Why let others dictate what you like and don’t like? Even if the reason they like it, you hate it — other people are making your decisions for you. Certainly, you can have a f^!k you personality, but you might find you are only screwing yourself.</p>

      <p>Ali Abdaal writing The Optimisation Paradox edition of his <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/newsletter/">newsletter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with optimising something for growth, and “treating it like a business”. But it comes with the trade-off that, usually, the thing becomes a little less fun.</p></blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t matter what you like doing, the moment you get reasonably good at it someone will say “I bet you could make some money doing that”. Should you choose to, it is at that point the fun will be sucked out of it.</p>
<p>Perhaps not straight away. It might take a few weeks or months. Perhaps longer. At some point, whilst trying to streamline it or maximise profits, you will realise you don’t enjoy doing this thing any more. You will realise that not everything needs to be monetised, and you will miss the old days of doing it for fun.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d64784cf27.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Like a sponge, if given free rein, our actions will suck all the fun out of everything. Ali quotes a ‘game designer’ from a video he has watched. What video and what game designer we don’t know, he said, “Left unchecked, players will optimise the fun out of the game they’re playing”.</p>
<p>Which, as Ali says, is an interesting quote (just not quite enough to write down who said it) because it cuts right to the heart of our unhealthy trait to ruin everything we enjoy by doing too much of it. My tendency, as Ali has found out, is to do this with podcasts. Start spending too much time on audio editing, recording too much, and lose sight of what really matters — the conversation.</p>
<p>I also say this fairly often about writing because I have seen it happen to friends of mine that now need to pay the bills by publishing. All the writing they did because they enjoyed it and moulded their craft, grinds to a holt. I guess, who on earth wants to do things for free, when they can get paid for it. Well, we all should.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For far too many years of my life, I was seeking ideas to boost the things I could get done. At first, it was tips for better conversion rates, better management styles and more recently it’s pure productivity “getting things done” advice. When you digest this kind of thing for even a short period of time, you begin to realise there is no hack for hard work.</p>
<p>In the least few years, self-help advice has exploded to become a multi-billion pound industry. What was once an occasional presentation and a few books in a store has ballooned to everything from podcasts, seminars and month long courses. There’s nothing wrong with this, of course, self-improvement is one of the most important things to do. However, most of the content being produced is not to make you better, it is solely to convince you there is a hack to ‘success’ and to attain it you just need to do this one thing.</p>
<p>That one thing is usually buying their course (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UComkllJTMHNZr4UNxCThdcw">at just £1995</a>), but that&rsquo;s not the point of this post. The fact that people believe there is a hack to everything is really the issue. Everyone wants a quick, easy fix. 5 minute abs, diet pills, a stupid morning routine — whatever it is you are trying to achieve, all these ‘hacks’ are a waste of time.</p>
<p>Everyone who is successful has worked hard (and perhaps had a <a href="https://dansilvestre.com/summaries/outliers-summary/">few leg ups</a>) and there is no replacement for it. I had a long conversation around this topic with my son once, when he was asking about shortcuts to wherever it was we were driving. I explained to him that there is no such thing as a shortcut, at all. There might be ways that appear shorter, or might shave some time off <em>sometimes</em> in very specific circumstances, but they simply don’t exist. They <strong>can’t</strong> exist. Otherwise, they would just be ‘the way’.</p>
<p>Much like trying to look for backstreets or quiet roads when you are driving, there are no hacks to get to places faster. You can pick up tips, learn different ways, but ultimately, you need to do the work and get to wherever it is you want to go, yourself.</p>

      <p>There are some mornings you get up, feel so under the weather from illness that you can’t face the world. Not to mention, you shouldn’t be spreading your infliction around to the rest of the workforce — so you ring in ill. Spending the day resting and recuperating instead. What if the opposite were true and you could pull a healthy?</p>
<p>I stumbled on this idea as a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CzvUmZshsRK/?igsh=bzN5M2lxNnp0NjIy">meme reel on Instagram</a>, but I think they are on to something. I might be the only one here, but I get these days when I feel well rested and ready to do something, but instead I have to deal with the daily grind of 8 (at least) hours of work. I wish I could call in and just say, “I feel too good today and don’t want to waste it. I’m pulling a healthy”.</p>
<p>I could then do whatever it is that makes me happy and enjoy the feeling. Instead of having to deal with the enjoyment sponges that every work place has. Or waste my energy on tasks that make other people money instead of going for a run and soaking in some sunshine.</p>
<p>The world would be a much better place if we could pull a healthy. Go on. You know you want to.</p>

      <p>Whenever anyone asks me <a href="/2021/08/25/writing-consistently.html">how I write so much,</a> my default answer used to be because I read so much. The words from other people producing content I enjoyed, be it on the web or in a book, never failed to give my pause of thought and inspiration to write them out. Not all of them were published, but I got to the stage where I was constantly putting things on my blog — currently, not so much.</p>
<p>I’m struggling to see the point in publishing many posts outside of those that form quickly. I’m still <a href="/2023/05/17/get-a-notebook.html">scribbling all the time</a>. Opening Ulysses or Apple notes to write some ideas down, but there is very little motivation to turn it into something publishable. As much as I love blogging, and love that more people are doing it than I have even known, I’m struggling.</p>
<p>I’ve read some great things already this year, but it feels as if the rate of content produced has ramped up, but the quality is slipping. It seems like I need a shift in my reading to offset those that just produce content quickly and cheaply, potentially with AI, for clicks.</p>
<p>The great thing is, I don’t do this for anything apart from myself. There is no demand on me putting my asinine thoughts on my blog, to earn my paycheque. So I have the freedom to step back whenever I want to, and presently my online life is getting very little attention.</p>

      <p>Evan Sheehan in their post <a href="https://darthmall.net/weblog/2023/rss/" class="u-in-reply-to">RSS?</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder what the alternative looks like. A tool that helps you remember the sites you like to visit so that you can browse them at your leisure, but that doesn’t create a commitment to read—or at least look at—absolutely everything that is published on all of those sites.</p></blockquote>
<p>At first, this seemed like a crazy idea, but the more I thought about it, the more it made perfect sense. I read 99% of the blogs I follow in my <a href="/2022/12/14/matter-my-most.html">favourite app Matter</a>. Which is great in that it boils websites down to the basic content and makes it easier to read. However, it removes all personality and expression from personal websites.</p>
<p>The idea above is not as crazy as it sounds. Before Facebook invented ‘the feed’ I remember keeping a bookmark list of my friends&rsquo; pages that I would check in on every so often and it&rsquo;s wonderful when the internet goes full circle. Making the same list of my favourite blogs to check and enjoy the revelry of their website brings life back into the web.</p>
<p>I just hope it doesn’t fuel my tendency to fiddle with my blog&rsquo;s CSS every five minutes!</p>

      <p>Leo Babauta saying <a href="https://zenhabits.net/quietude/">Become Quiet So You Can Listen</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…it’s a very human tendency to want to be busy, productive, filling every space with something useful or entertaining.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m one of those suckers. Those people who accuse the modern world of always being to blame for everything wrong until proven otherwise. This is one of those posts that makes me think about a small throwaway point and change my view.</p>
<p>Is it a natural human trait to want to be busy with something?</p>
<p>I suffer with a constant restless body to the point that, at times, I have to <a href="/2022/12/24/my-theme-for.html">force myself</a> to stop and do nothing. Just for a bit. My mind tricks me into believing that if I am not doing something, anything, I am wasting my time. I thought this was because of the modern world, some rub of from hustle culture, but now I am starting to think it is just me.</p>
<p>Long before social media, YouTube productivity gurus and hustle porn, the world was still busy. My mother was endlessly doing something. Working, meeting people, taking part in events. Just never still and present. Perhaps this is where my habit comes from, or maybe it’s just the modern normal?</p>

      <p>Alan Jacobs with an interesting <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/a-note-on-plagiarism/">note on plagiarism</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…see something in a digital book or article that they want to use, copy the relevant text, and then paste it into Word with the intention of editing it later to in some sense make it their own.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alan’s note covers controversy in academic publishing and the plagiarism that could be caused by sloppy writing and the pressures of education. However, I spent the whole time thinking about blogging and linking posts. I don’t write many of what you would typically call a link post, but I do quote numerous people on my blog and often run through the thought process that Alan talks about.</p>
<p>I save loads of quotes for possible use later. They litter my notebook, my Apple notes and even the occasional sticky note on my desk. Little snippets of ideas or information I might need later to complete some work or give me a starting point for my ideas in a blog post. I always stay true to the original person, but I must admit there’s not a lot of work needed to change the wording and attempt to pass the work off as your own.</p>
<p>Which leads me to wonder where the point is that the copied words become your own? Is changing the phrasing slightly enough?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…if you quote too much, it might become obvious that there’s not a lot of you in your article. So you need to rework the quotations to make the extent of your debts less obvious.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have all seen blog posts that are more quotes than content. Which is fine, to a point, and where the aim is to share the work of someone else to another audience. When there isn’t a lot added to the conversation outside of that, you do have to ask yourself, what’s the point — and Alan suggests this is where much plagiarism begins. The words are changed, or in some cases not changed enough, due to lack of extra content and not wanting to make it obvious.</p>

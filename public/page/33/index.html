<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>There’s a lot of talk out there about AI and the future of this, that and the other. The opinions range from creative work is doomed, to “no, this is fine” and many more somewhere between. I am sure you’ve read loads of hot takes – well, here’s mine, and it’s a bit different from most.</p>
<p>I am a creative worker. I run design, marketing, and content for a business and I have been doing it a long time. I’ve seen things come and go, trends grow and fade. The use of AI in, well, absolutely everything, feels different. There’s a reason people are both fascinated and terrified at the same time because this really will be a drastic change. I feel as if we are seeing the next phase of technology evolve before our eyes, and there is a lot to look forward too.</p>
<p>There are some logical fears as well. A genuine worry that platforms like GPT will remove the need for writers, reporters, and even artists. That individuals who have spent years learning their crafts are going to see their job opportunities disappear overnight. The reality is that we are still a very long way from that, but there <em>is</em> a cause for concern.</p>
<p>Undoubtably, some organisations will replace their creative workers with AI. Those are the organisations that are not in their field for the good of the world, just to turn a profit. A bot has been able to cobble together a blog post, or a factual news article for a long while, albeit with a lot of oversight and correction, but as technology improves so too will the output. Those that straight away lean on these tools are not the type of organisation you want to be working for anyway.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b78b79987e.jpg" alt="digital art of a male writer crying onto their laptop by Dall-E"></p>
<p>Those that view a person with experience as expendable, to be replaced by code, are using you as a tool already. They are simply upgrading their tools to the newest available, like a business would anything else it owned. Thankfully, they are still going to need people to do the work for them. There will become a whole market for those that can interact with the AI to create the best possible outcome – and that will be the new creative market worker.</p>
<p>By using the experience from creating, the new creative worker will learn to use AI to make their job easier, rather than resit and lose their job entirely. Crafting prompts and detailed instructions for the AI, putting them together and checking them over afterwards. You may be getting <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F">Midjourney</a> to illustrate the hero image of a blog post about Twitters new crisis, written by the latest iteration of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>. Tweaking the prompt and output as you go to reflect the tone you require and elicit the correct emotional response.</p>
<p>You might be the editor of an online magazine that is prompted to cover a specific company because the traffic would spike. Or an SEO consultant that can use AI to scan a website and improve its ranking based on data from all the readers from the last year. Whatever it may be, you <em>will</em> rely on AI, so embrace it now. There will be reduced need for workers, there’s no getting around this, but those that skill up will become the new full-stack developer unicorn.</p>
<p>Sure, anyone can type into a prompt box and get results. Anyone can search Google and find what they are looking for. It is the next step that yields better results. Knowing the keywords and short codes that will find exactly what you require in a faster time. The new creative will be one that speaks to a developed AI instead of a dumb algorithm.</p>
<p>Charlie Warzel mentioned <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/google-bing-race-to-launch-ai-chatbot-powered-search-engines/673006/">in his excellent piece yesterday</a> that there is already a growing market for those individuals that can coax the very best results from the AI tools available. Being able to sell your understanding and ‘speak’ to the AI tools available is already a viable income. Like the jump from film, to digital and then into the Photoshop era pissed off photographers who didn’t evolve, so too will AI if you’re not onboard.</p>

     <p>As a means of follow up to my post in <a href="/2022/01/04/subscription-creep.html">early 2022</a>, I decided to think about my subscriptions yet again. I’d like to say that things are different now, but it seems worse. Every service seems to have changed to a subscription and those that have already seem to be hiking the prices, some by quite a bit!</p>
<p>There have been some adjustments in my usage and also returns of apps I ditched.</p>
<h2 id="must-haves">Must Haves</h2>
<p><a href="https://ulysses.app/" title="Ulysses">Ulysses</a> - still my favourite wiring app, don’t see this going anywhere, perhaps ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a> - Still don’t pay for it technically, still essential. Nothing will ever replace it, but it costs a fortune. Not interested in replacements.</p>
<p><a href="/2021/12/18/brain-fm-the.html">Brain FM</a> - Never ever giving this up, gets more work done than any other subscription I pay for.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> - I was experimenting last year, and this year it&rsquo;s my blog. Love this service.</p>
<p><a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> - Canceled this last year, but I’ve started <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">journaling in a big way</a>, and it has quickly become a must-have.</p>
<h2 id="changed">Changed</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-one/">Apple one</a> - replaced with the family plan following the price increase. Don’t use News nor Fitness+ so saved £120 a year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> - Still acts as my playground a little and hosts <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk">gregmorris.co.uk</a>, but may ditch this later in the year.</p>
<h2 id="gone">Gone</h2>
<p>Pocketcasts - Replaced with Overcast, purely to save a bit of money.</p>
<p>Netflix - Very little on that make the cost worth it any more.</p>
<p>Headspace - Still meditating, but doing it with some Brain FM background noise. The app became a real chore to use and far too busy.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years I have become really aware of the subscriptions I sign up for and the value they give. I’ve cut around 10 out and saved no end of money. I agree that developers should get the money they deserve but the costs of some really put me off. Glad I did the experiment and cut down my spending.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Over the last few months, I have had a few questions in my working life on how I stay so focused. I have made myself a fairly rigid routine, particularly when working in the office, of putting my headphones on and pumping out work. The weird reason I’m able to do this when seemingly everyone else chats or bangs away answering emails is my acceptance of how distractible I am.</p>
<p>We all have a section of our brain dedicated to instant gratification. People often refer to is as our chimp brain, <a href="https://mo.work/blog/how-to-master-the-habits-of-high-performing-teams/">Dave Brailsford calls it our Lizard brain</a>, it’s the part of us that isn’t interested in anything but itself. It urges you to stop when you’re exercising, it talks you into another slice of cake, and it keeps you scrolling social media. Whatever it desired, if I am not paying attention it’s in charge.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/36aa0d6f1d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The great thing is I have realised this and put things in place to stop it. Trained myself to quieten it down in certain situations and removed the temptations it loves. Once my headphones are on, and I’m <a href="/2021/12/18/brain-fm-the.html">listening to Brain FM</a>, I’m pushed into a kind of flow state and it doesn’t stand a chance. My phone is out the way, I’m in Work Focus mode, and there’s nothing but <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">a notebook</a> by my side.</p>
<p>There are no superpowers going on here. It seems like everything in our modern lives is made into distract us. So, you <em>need</em> to remove them. Phones, apps, web browsers, whatever it is, before long your monkey brain will get its way and whisk you away. Simply by recognising how distractible I am, could I begin to combat it. As soon as I feel the itch I recognise it and push it away, and if it becomes too much I tend to have a walk around for 5 mins. In this time it important to be disciplined, I wouldn’t dare look at my phone!</p>

     <p>There is a new word I learnt a few weeks ago – compersion. It’s vicarious joy, associated with sexual pleasure (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/04/altered-states-love-without-limits-review-louis-theroux-treads-his-tightrope">Louis Theroux taught me it</a> before you ask). It’s used mainly in talk around swinging and polyamorous relationships. However, that’s not what I want to discuss (thank god) but it does relate to what I think my calling in life is.</p>
<p>I struggle to see the point in life. For many years of it I have <a href="/2021/03/30/the-thought-of.html">been in pain</a> and for a long time have questioned what the end goal is. I&rsquo;m a creature of habit and strive for structure and routine, but often feel like I’m living in a never-ending cycle looking for the exit route. Endlessly searching for the point in all this, and maybe because I’m getting on a bit I’ve started to look harder.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cb131e0661.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This has been the topic of my <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">journaling</a> and my notes. I’ve been reading and watching so much about the topic that Google must think I’m having a breakdown. Perhaps I am, but I think I’ve cracked it. I think the whole reason I am here is the vicarious enjoyment I get from improving other people lives.</p>
<p>I’ve become a little obsessed in leaving a legacy. I won’t be able to leave trust funds or investments, I just want to leave behind memories of a great guy. When I’m gone, I want people to think “he was a great guy that Greg”. That’s it.</p>
<p>I enjoy other people trusting me enough to come to me for advice. I love going out of my way to help people with chores or issues or anything really. I get my kicks from seeing other people smile. If there is an all powerful creator they 100% put me here to help other people. Sure, I get enjoyment from technology and other stuff, but improving other people’s lives is my drug!</p>
<p>I think I’m doing a pretty good job, but there’s always more to do. Perhaps now I know myself a bit more, I can go even further.</p>

     <p>Yesterday, myself and my wife celebrate 14 years of being together. It’s not as long as some people, but we’ve been so far together that it feels like a lifetime. We’ve had ups and downs in our time together, but we’ve always remained strong and grow closer together all the time.</p>
<p>I know everyone says this about their other half (maybe not <em>everyone</em>) but I feel so lucky to have found her. We are in many ways polar opposites, a minimalist vs a maximalist, but seem to be the Yin to each other&rsquo;s Yang.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f7c279b15c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s not all ups in fact, we’ve had a lot of downs, but we deal with the downs together. Raising two wonderful kids, dealing with all of Lucie’s hospital appointments and social care needs as best we can.</p>
<p>The best thing is that my wife makes me a better person. That’s all I can wish for in a person. Someone that loves and cares for me, but also challenges me and pushes me forward. My biggest fan and also the person who keeps me grounded. I love this woman with all my heart. ❤️</p>

     <p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> has allowed more innovative things to come out than I imagined. It’s become more than the pointless plug that was introduced alongside the iPhone 12. Apple built a pretty great range of accessories. It’s bound to be improved upon over the years, but before that happens, can we please go back to the iPhone battery case.</p>
<p>Before everyone yells at me to tell me how horrible it looks, I get it. It was ugly, heavy and a bit of a nightmare to get in your pocket – but the iPhone battery case sold alongside iPhone from 7 to 11 was an excellent solution. It is an exceptional application of function over form and far exceeds the usefulness of the current MagSafe battery.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e031179b13.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>For around £130 you could boost the battery of your iPhone by around 80%. This depended on your usage, but by using one on my iPhone 7 I could double the battery life easily and also have a case around my phone at all times. Admittedly, this wasn’t the nicest case in the world. Made from a very grippy rubber that seemed to pick up pocket lint like it couldn’t bare to be away from it – it still kept your phone protected.</p>
<p>The MagSafe battery pack in comparison costs around the same as the old battery case, but doesn’t function nearly as well. Arguably it is a more elegant solution, you can slap the battery pack on as and when required instead of carrying around the battery all day. With the MagSafe magnets keeping it attached to the back of your iPhone 12/13 or 14. However, in reality it barely clings to the phone, and you have to handle it with care to actually keep charging your phone.</p>
<p>There is no case to keep the battery pack attached to the back of your phone, leading to loss of charge and a much less economical way to charge your phone. By using wireless charging to charge the phone instead of the Lightning method used by the battery case, the MagSafe battery pack gives you around another 40-60% charge. Possibly more, but the rate and level of charge is dictated far more by phone usage and temperature.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c2988de66f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Should you need to recharge your MagSafe battery pack, it needs to be plugged into Lightning, thus kind of defeating the whole point of it. You can’t wirelessly charge the wireless battery, but you <em>can</em> charge both at the same time, albeit very slowly. The battery case does require the same Lightning charging, but charges both your phone and your battery at the same time and much quicker than MagSafe. With no issues with loss of connectivity nor heat.</p>
<p>I also think the case is a much more pleasing solution than the white battery stuck to the back of your phone. The battery case was not the nicest looking case in the world, far from it, but the MagSafe Battery is much worse. It doesn’t fit to the back of the phone very well and, although it arguably looks OK on an iPhone Mini, it looks ridiculous on the iPhone Pro Max versions.</p>
<p>What they both do have going for them however is excellent support built into iOS itself. Being able to see the charge of both batteries at glance makes them both much better options than many third-party versions. If Apple sold a separate case to fit over both phone and battery pack, the MagSafe battery would be much more usable, but frankly they should just go back to using the battery case full stop.</p>

     <p>I know what you’re thinking, yet another put down post for my pet hate social media site, but no. There’s some praise this time, kind of. The truth is, there is nowhere else that’s quite like Twitter. I can <a href="/2022/11/16/some-small-thoughts.html">muse all I like</a> about what brands should be doing, but if you’ve got an issue, and you want it resolving – doing it in public on Twitter usually gets results.</p>
<p>For the last few days, I’ve been trying to get my company sorted on a business plan with <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft</a>. It’s not my favourite app in the world, but I tried loads with the team, and it was the most rounded for what we needed. Unfortunately, the sign-up has been less than smooth, so I reached out to them via their preferred email method and waited. Two days passed by, and baring in mind I was waiting for to spend money, I received no reply.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dd1ad01c8d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There is something to be said about my confidence levels in their product now, and I’m frustrated. So, I did the only thing I could think of, logged into Twitter for the first time in months to tweet at them. In minutes, I have a reply from the co-founder Viktor and an email address to contact him.</p>
<p>The issue is not resolved yet, and I’m not far way from walking away instead, but this shows the power that Twitter has. Nowhere else can you do this with brands and get your issue sorted. This isn’t unique to Craft, I’ve done it numerous times over the years and sorted numerous issues all on Twitter – via a quick tweet and usually a follow-up by DM.</p>
<p>The chance of this being possible on Mastodon is frankly slim to none. Although I still hold up hope that the same activity could be replicated, I think that we would have started to see movements by now. There’s just something about Twitter that, I doubt, could be replicated elsewhere.</p>

     <p>Josh Ginter <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2023/01/30/im-back-in-the-plus-club/">shared some thoughts on returning to Plus Club</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pro Max’s larger, more comfortable keyboard means I can bang out responses a little quicker and hone in some of my more focused Mac-time to truly productive work rather than email responding.</p></blockquote>
<p>Should I believe that everything happens for a reason, I would start to think the universe wants me to have a big phone again. Over the weekend, I had a long chat with good friend <a href="https://darylbaxter.com/">Daryl Baxter</a> and talked about an iPad Mini for content consumption. Only after remembering the price of the new mini did I consider the potential benefits of having a bigger phone instead.</p>
<p>In my <a href="/2021/08/26/minimalism-and-big.html">self reasoning post</a> from 2021 I argued that if you want one device the biggest you can get make sense. There are huge advantages to have a big phone for typing, watching content and interacting with it – most people only see the downsides. Which tare considerable when you consider the weight and sheer size of the Max models of iPhone.</p>
<p>With that said, I used the 13 Pro Max for most of last year and enjoyed being able to type out blog posts easily, edit photos enjoyably and generally get along a bit better when I needed to use my phone. It’s when it’s not in use that the downsides become obvious. That budge in my pants is the camera bump, I’m not pleased to see you!</p>
<p>As I become more <a href="/2022/11/18/apple-watch-ultra.html">reliant on my Apple Watch</a> and only have my phone on me when it’s unavoidable, it makes sense to have the best one that does the small tasks well. Writing, reading, watching a film on the elliptical all lend themselves to jointing the Max Club again.</p>
<p>Damn it, I think I just talked myself into it.</p>

     <p>I’ve tried several times to articulate my feelings on <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a>, but failed every time. Sometimes frustratingly so because I think a lot of my problems relate to things I feel when using it. Don’t get me wrong it works great, and some features are really well done, it just doesn’t feel like it wants me to enjoy reading.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5426bd7384.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So, I’m stuck trying to pin down thoughts on sometimes ephemeral feelings provoked by an app. You can’t measure and compare feelings, but you know when they just don’t push your buttons. In contrast to <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/">Matter</a> that I have been using as my read it later app for quite a while, it feels strange. With all its straight edges and <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2013/05/06/android-what-does-holo-mean/">hollo like colours,</a> it always strikes me as industrial.</p>
<p>It feels like it is made to <a href="/2022/04/10/reading-doesnxt-need.html">hack my reading</a>. I can swipe this way and that way, highlighting until my heart&rsquo;s content. Optimised to get through my queue as quickly and as easy as possible by pushing me towards using keyboard shortcuts, recommending highlights and archiving everything for use later on. If I’m too busy to even read the article, I can ask AI to summarise it for me, and even write talking points on it.</p>
<p>If that’s your thing, and I believe it is for many people, this app is great. There are loads of options and what seems like a never-ending series of screen options. It’s just not for me, and that’s OK. Matt Birchler did an really great overview of its features and you can check it out below. I’d highly recommend a subscribe to Matts channel too, it’s one of my favourites.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZTYCA73I5uQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>For a reading app, I think it’s important to make reading the most important factor. Everything else should get out of the way, with intuitive and easy to reach controls. Otherwise, you’re in danger of creating a busy environment that leads to an overwhelming feeling once articles build up.</p>
<p>I am currently still using both Readwise and Matter for different reasons. Reader to fly through my subscribed feeds and work related newsletter reading, and Matter to relax whilst catching up on my saved articles. With them both being premium services, and reasonably expensive ones at that, this can’t continue once my free trial is up. There are no difficult decision to make for me, but I love that Reader exists. Both to push Matter forward and to offer alternatives for people that need different things. If you’re in the market, it’s worth checking out.</p>

     <p>Like most people I know, I am constantly worried about getting through my task list. At times in the last couple of years I’ve been absolutely buried with no way out. I’m always desperate for ways to maximise my time and ‘hack’ my way to getting more done. Judging by half of the YouTube videos I am suggested, I am not the only one, but there <em>is</em> a surprising fix.</p>
<p>I must preface this post by saying that these thoughts are 100% inspired by the brilliant book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780374159122">4,000 weeks</a> by Oliver Burkeman. A book I descovered by complete accident after stumbling on some of his <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/posts">blog posts</a>. There’s also a certain amount of presumption going on here, we don’t all control our task lists, but we can all control the way we approach them. So, I feel as if there are loads of areas of life that these general thoughts can be applied to.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e9c77aa777.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When it comes to work, it isn’t often the actual tasks that cause the issues. It is the stress of having so much to do and never enough time to do it. The way of the world seems to be stuffing more and more things into less and less time. It doesn’t matter if the things you have to get done are decided externally or your deadlines are internal, the end of your task list will <strong>never</strong> come.</p>
<p>There will always be more work to do. Things that you could get done, and jobs that are waiting for gaps in your time. Companies expect more and more from their workers, and getting towards the end of your list only leads to more tasks. It is only when you realise that you can only get done what you can the real freedom comes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you still under the illusion that you&rsquo;ll one day reach a point in your life where you no longer have any problems? — Sam Harris</p></blockquote>
<p>There is absolutely no point stressing about getting to the end because modern life is a treadmill you can never get off. Much like “inbox zero” only leads to more emails, all the modern productivity punchlines just lead to more work. By embracing the fact that the end will never arrive, you can relax, knock as many tasks off as you can and get some downtime.</p>
<p>No revelation will happen, but the freedom from feeling guilty for the tasks you complete just leads to a happier life. It might lead you to get better work done, too.</p>

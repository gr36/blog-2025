     <p>The modern world is great. We live in a time that is the safest in known history. The healthcare available is phenomenal, and there is a plethora of technology available cheaply to make our lives easier. Yet, in many respects, I sometimes think that it’s almost too easy.</p>
<p>I am not saying I want to go back to times where I had to worry about ever returning from a walk in the countryside. However, there is something about the way that technology, and even at times the world, allows us to do things, or get away with not doing things. I could, if I chose to do so, stay here, sitting on my couch for days on end and barely move.</p>
<p>I can have food delivered, be entertained by watching pixels move around on the screen, and even pretend I’m socialising by texting some friends. With the internet at my fingertips, I could do any number of things, strap a screen to my face, and even convince myself I am outside, whenever I choose. I can exist here in a bubble, yet barely exist at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do I have to complain about, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm? - Marcus Aurelius</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t, of course, because that’s not in my nature to do so. Some people would say I barely sit still, but my predilection for action doesn’t allow me to stay in my bubble for very long. That doesn’t mean I don’t succumb to the temptations of easiness. It’s easy to waste time scrolling through social media, easy to look up things instead of working them out, and far too easy to comment on other people’s experiences.</p>
<p>I have lost count of the times I have stopped short of replying to someone on social media. Or perhaps deleted the post a few moments after hitting send, because it’s just too easy to get involved. To know things about people living thousands of miles away, to take in the information they are sharing, and to make your own thoughts known. That’s the great thing about social media, the ability to share and debate, but I am of the opinion that it’s too easy to reply.</p>
<p>In the excellent book Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari talks about gossip and storytelling being important for our human development. That might be the case, that my sassy replies are somehow a result of our human nature to survive - but they don’t do me nor others any good. It’s too easy for me to throw in my two cents and upset everyone, including myself. There is no friction between seeing a post and hitting reply, when some barriers would do us all good.</p>

     <p>A little over two years ago, I first started experiencing weird happenings. I would grab my laptop, sit on the couch or at my desk ready to write a blog post, and a little while later, I would catch myself answering work emails or updating things on our website. Without realising it, I had stopped writing, if I even started at all, and had begun working full-on when I should have been switched off. At <a href="/2022/08/18/all-work-and.html">that time</a>, I tried to split things up; it never worked, and I am back to feeling frustrated.</p>
<p>I have one computer for everything. At this point, it&rsquo;s a 16&quot; M3 MacBook Pro, provided by my company, and for work things, I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way. My hybrid setup means I can work at home from my desk and monitor, I can take it with me to my office, or be just as happy working <a href="/2023/11/10/coffee-shop-adventures.html">in a coffee shop</a>. The issues only arise when I want to do some personal things, and my work things are always right in front of my face.</p>
<p>The internal debate on using an iPad for my &lsquo;creative&rsquo; work was sparked last time by Josh Ginter, but if I am honest, I don&rsquo;t want to open that can of worms again. I do have an 11&quot; iPad that very rarely sees any use, and a few iPadOS updates later, it sits in exactly the same place it always has. However, I noted Matt Birchler <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/i-miss-having-an-ipad/">missing his iPad</a> a few days ago, and he has an important point to consider.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the iPad Pro might subconsciously give me unrealistic expectations for how much I need to get out of the iPad.</p></blockquote>
<p>When you spend as much as a laptop on an iPad Pro with a keyboard and pencil like Apple tells you to, it gives you a lot of false expectations. As a user, you now have to justify all that expense by seeing a return, and the iPad just isn&rsquo;t up to the job. I can do all the things I need to do with writing and photography on an iPad, but I have to spend my time hacking my way there. Which is fine until Apple breaks something, and I&rsquo;m back to square one.</p>
<p>Which leads me on to my second point, really. In many ways, my iPhone is my &lsquo;creative computer.&rsquo; I write a lot of my blog posts on it, nearly always edit photos on it, and Apple seems to take more care with the OS, so things rarely break. You may consider iPadOS and iOS one and the same; however, there have been many instances where the shortcuts my business relies on have broken on an iPad yet continue to work on iOS.</p>
<p>This feeling of relying on my phone doesn&rsquo;t fill me with confidence. If you&rsquo;ve read more than one of my posts, you will know I yearn for a smartphone-free life. Yet, I feel content in the fact that it fulfils an important role in my life—it costs about as much as an iPad Pro, so it should! This post didn&rsquo;t start off as a way to justify my iPhone. I&rsquo;ve tried to do that before, but more of an appreciation of the work it does for me. It&rsquo;s easy to be down on using your smartphone, and you should be aware of it, but users aren&rsquo;t always scrolling through social media. They just might be doing their work.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>When I read philosophy, it nearly always gets me thinking about technology. Not because I am obsessed with it, or that it occupies all of my thoughts, but because I don&rsquo;t really have any other vices to solve. I mean, I probably do, but my usage of technology is one of the only things I seek a solution for. Which usually means I moan about it on my blog, or I shut myself off from it. Which is completely the wrong approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show us these things, so we can see that you truly have learned from the philosophers ~ Epictetus, Discourses 3.21.5-6</p></blockquote>
<p>When Epictetus writes &lsquo;show us these things,&rsquo; he means the rest of your life. He refers to eating, drinking, suffering abuse, having children, all of the things that you expect to fill your life with. Only amongst all of these &rsquo;normal&rsquo; things will you really show your true values and morals. You, and those around you, will be able to judge if your <a href="/2021/05/19/where-do-your.html">values are true</a> only with, and against, action.</p>
<p>It is easy to be a virtuous man if you shut yourself off from the world. Never having temptation nor the opportunity to test yourself. The Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, came from the riches of royal parents and was content with nothing. Jesus walked with sinners, thieves, and prostitutes, yet knew himself. The list of people that became great whilst living in the world is endless, yet the temptation to shut out everything is a powerful one. The problem becomes when your outlook on the world is never tested, they are never hardened or broken by the world.</p>
<p>How does this relate to technology, you might be wondering? Well, this all boils down to my constant desire to remove it from my life. I don&rsquo;t <a href="/2020/08/09/i-cant-go.html">want a smartphone</a>, yet I need one. I don&rsquo;t want to <a href="/2022/12/01/snacking-on-the.html">use social media much</a>, yet it brings me <a href="/2022/03/13/trying-to-make.html">much needed</a> interaction. I am still walking the path to self-discovery and, as I have <a href="/2020/09/09/itxs-not-the.html">written about before</a>, the knee-jerk reaction is to remove all of the things that I use, get a smaller phone, or a <a href="/2023/08/23/my-big-flip.html">dumb phone</a> and wait for the changes to happen.</p>
<p>Yet they never do. Because the fix is not removing the desire; it is ensuring you no longer desire it. I can happily sit in a pub surrounded by drunk people, and a drop will not pass my lips - because the desire has been removed from my life. I could take an entire busload of people to McDonald&rsquo;s and not order a thing, but take me to a shop selling technology and my cup may very well overflow. When I can sit and watch an Apple keynote and not order a thing, that will be peace, my friends.</p>

     <p>Mr Mobile review of a product I had my eye on for meeting notes, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKoJUqkcKg">Plaud Note</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the question you really have to ask with any product like this. What company am I entrusting with these potentially sensitive recordings? Well, answering that led me down a fascinating rabbit hole into the world of so called registered agents, which are essentially companies that allow certain types of businesses to operate by giving them a physical address for legal purposes&hellip;in Wyoming, registered agents don&rsquo;t seem to need to do any kind of vetting of the companies they represent.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was not the way I expected the review to end, but it raised an interesting point. There is no claim of anything fishy going on with Plaid, but things like this are why I really love Michael&rsquo;s reviews. He thinks deeper than most people would about a product that receives masses of our own, and other people&rsquo;s, data.</p>
<p>Of course, he also raises this about the dozens of phones we do the same with, but this company in question is a bit of an enigma. Of course, if you want to achieve the same result, the alternative is to hand this data to Google or (Not so) OpenAI; however, I think I trust them more.</p>
<p>The type of data I would hand over using the Plaud Note would be personally and business sensitive, and I don&rsquo;t think anyone should be doing this without knowing exactly who is processing it. With an endless sea of data brokers, that might not be 100% possible, but not knowing who the OEM is in the first place, hard pass from me.</p>

     <p>Matt Birchler, writing about the technology used in <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/ai-as-a-marketing-tool/">wristbands at concerts</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever a company says, “We’re using AI to enhance our product,” ask them for specifics. Often, it’s either complete nonsense or something so minor that it’s essentially doing nothing. It’s not always the case, but I think you’d be surprised how much “AI” is mentioned in product marketing as nothing more than a marketing tool to look modern.</p></blockquote>
<p>The piece linked by Matt is incredibly interesting, but this is the part that resonated with me and confirmed what I&rsquo;ve suspected for a while. Now that everything is marketed as having AI, I am more convinced than ever that hardly anything actually utilises any type of AI. I&rsquo;ve seen companies make claims about their products that amount to nothing more than a bunch of IF statements in their code.</p>
<p>I mean, sure, that&rsquo;s essentially what generative AI is if you zoom out enough and reduce it to its simplest structure, but a significant portion of these products marketed as using AI absolutely do not use AI in the generally accepted sense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a deeper, more fascinating shift in our collective psychology occurring. The assumption that even fairly simple gadgets are advanced electronics is a downstream result of all the marketing hype. I am often amazed by what people attribute to the extraordinary, which could be explained quite simply. The wizardry and witchcraft that once filled the gaps in our understanding are now labeled as AI, when in reality, hardly any intelligence is involved at all.</p>

     <p>Rex Barrett writing about his ongoing <a href="https://rexbarrett.com/posts/my-content-diet-overhaul">content diet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; Filling my time with these junk apps is alluring, and I feel good when using them, but I want to find content that takes me somewhere. Ultimately, I don’t want to look back and see hours blocks of time squandered on things I’ll not even remember in a day or two.</p></blockquote>
<p>My brain goes through these cycles of needing to back away from the web completely, to diving in constantly. It often coincides with bouts of low mental health and other issues, and much like binge eating it is a comping mechanism to distract me from other things.</p>
<p>In many ways I know that <a href="/2022/12/01/snacking-on-the.html">snacking on the internet</a> is bad for me, but at the same time I enjoy using it. Overtime I have built up an intolerance to shameless showboating, attention seeking and needless hyperbole which I why I tend to steer clear of Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and similar platforms in favour of decentralised mediums (namely Mastodon). With non algorithmic timelines these things are kept to a minimum and as such as much better for me.</p>

     <p>Cory Dransfeldt has great posts about AI, and <a href="https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/i-dont-want-anything-your-ai-generates/">this one is no exception</a>. Of course, he&rsquo;s right in his stance on AI-generated images, but as with everything, I don&rsquo;t find the conclusion so simple.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The images it generates are, at best, a polished regression to the mean. If you want custom art, pay an artist.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I have covered <a href="/2024/03/08/blogging-ai-me.html">before</a>, my thoughts on generative AI are mixed. While I understand many of the issues people have with it, I can&rsquo;t find the same motivation. I use it many times a day to help with tasks that would have taken me much longer; it helps me out with code issues I have, and I also use it to generate images for my blog posts. While I don&rsquo;t do this a lot, these generated images are a replacement for using stock images. Photos from places like Unsplash are not uncommon to see on the web, pushed by platforms like Ghost and WordPress, and these do not generate any income for artists either.</p>
<p>I would <em>love</em> to have the money to pay an artist to produce images for my blog, but this is not viable, which I am sure is the case for many people. Generative AI just helps me out now and again to make my posts a little more appealing. That is not to say I don&rsquo;t take onboard the ethical issues; my use of these images has plummeted in the last few months due to this, and in many instances where I would have used an image in the past, I just publish the post with text.</p>
<p>There should be a safe middle ground to cater to these ethical conundrums, as there should be for <a href="/2024/03/10/its-your-work-you-should-be-able-to-decide.html">stopping AI from hoovering up your data</a> - but I just don&rsquo;t see one happening.</p>

     <p>One of the first sections I added to my new blog is a reading page. I adore reading, and if I&rsquo;m not reading, I am often pondering over the things I have read. It&rsquo;s an obsession, but one I happily embrace. The only problem with my need to track these activities is the standard at which I consider something as read.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been debate online about the distinction between reading a book and &lsquo;reading&rsquo; an audiobook. I don&rsquo;t wish to ignite that discussion now, so I&rsquo;ll steer clear of it due to my aversion to audiobooks. Despite trying them several times and spending considerable money on them (why are they so expensive?), my brain just doesn&rsquo;t absorb the information as effectively as it does with reading.</p>
<p>My dilemma isn’t with that particular hot topic; it&rsquo;s more about the quantity of the book consumed. In recent years, I&rsquo;ve persevered through books I&rsquo;d rather not have wasted time on (looking at you, Feel Good Productivity) but did so to finish them. Not because of the vain metrics I set for my reading tally, but simply because I feel I need to. Did I really read a book if I only got halfway through it?</p>
<p>If I did read it, is there a threshold for progress I need to reach? I certainly grasped the point of some books <em>long</em> before the halfway mark. My Kindle history is littered with lengthy books that could have been blog posts, and I&rsquo;m starting to ponder the wasted time. When you&rsquo;re 40, life definitely is <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/arts-and-lifestyle/article/giving-up-on-books">too short for bad books</a>. So, perhaps I should start abandoning them earlier when I’m confident I&rsquo;ve understood the gist.</p>
<p>This raises the question: Did I read a book if I can summarise it? If I skipped the book entirely and opted for <a href="https://www.cliffsnotes.com/">Cliff Notes</a>, does that count as reading? Following my rationale above, it <em>could</em> be the case. I&rsquo;m not suddenly going to <a href="/2022/04/10/reading-doesnxt-need.html">hack my reading</a> and get AI to summarise them for me - but I might consider it for some dull books.</p>
<p>If the end result is the same, there&rsquo;s no argument, barring the very real benefits of actually reading the book. Reading a book is quite different from knowing what the book is about. There&rsquo;s something wonderful about understanding the author and the origin of their words. Experiencing the journey in a well-paced process, rather than being bombarded with a brief summary.</p>
<p>However, this only really applies to good books. Enduring bad ones rarely benefits me, except for the occasional headache, so the cycle continues. Other than realising that I should abandon some books sooner, I haven&rsquo;t really reached a conclusion in this post. Much like the bad books I&rsquo;m discussing.</p>

     <p>I wrote a few days ago about my personal take on AI being trained on my writing. Although I expected much more anger, hence the rather long block at the bottom, I am happy to see some nice responses and some pushback on the ideas. It sparked several emails, a few text messages, and one <a href="https://brandonwrites.xyz/re-blogging-and-ai-a-personal-take/">very well-thought-through response</a> post.</p>
<p>Erlend <a href="https://mas.to/@havn/112066516781424713">on Mastodon</a> raised a very good point when considering other people&rsquo;s choices:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the way it&rsquo;s been now, those who would like to choose differently than us, don&rsquo;t get that opportunity. And I find that problematic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is a very good point. My post was a very personal response to the swirling emotions on this topic, and I had considered other people&rsquo;s websites. Everyone should, of course, have the choice of whether their data is used or not. Something that isn&rsquo;t a revolutionary idea, but one that seems to cause issues being enforced on the internet. The EU is making the most, if sometimes misguided, progress on this front with GDPR and the wider DMA.</p>
<p>I particularly enjoyed David Pierce <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24067997/robots-txt-ai-text-file-web-crawlers-spiders">writing</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24074795/vision-pro-returns-xbox-future-gemini-open-ai-vergecast">talking</a> about robots.txt. The long-time effort to stop bots from crawling your website, which of course is no more than a handshake agreement with no legal standing - and therefore is of very little use. This leads me to think there may be some way to do it in the future, but I always come back to my original point.</p>
<p>Of course, you should have a choice, and the ability to block what is done with the things you post online, but it takes effort to lock them away if you so wish. Make your account private and put your posts behind a paywall; that should do it. However, your &lsquo;reach&rsquo; will be extremely limited, and you might not get the result you want. Users have always been able to copy and paste your words, right-click and save your images; this is just the way it is, and it all comes down to you, and what you want to do - there&rsquo;s a trade-off with everything.</p>

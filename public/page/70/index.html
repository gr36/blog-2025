  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>One thing that constantly surprises me on micro.blog is how nice people are. This has something to do with the barrier to entry being a bit nerdy, but everything to do with the scale of the platform. Although everyone seems to think that abuse and harassment is something unique to the main social networks, it’s actually a problem of scale.</p><p>You see I love micro.blog (<a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/why-microblog/">it took me a while</a>) with my main appreciation being that it’s <em>not</em>where everyone is. Sure, I’d like more people to post it, I’d love to follow more interesting people, but with all the noise comes issues. My feed is filled with thoughtful comments, far too much debate about <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/this-is-how/">what platform to publish too</a>, and nice photos. There is a positive vibe to the place, so much so that there appears to be no movement towards thinking about moderation.</p><p>The platform can be independent of the publishing platforms, so a swift move to remove cross posting would be easy to do, as well as removing hateful comments. This lax approach seems to be shared by every new approach and always fails to work, at scale.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All social apps grow until you need a newsfeed<br />All newsfeeds grow until you need an algorithmic feed<br />All algorithmic feeds grow until you get fed up of not seeing stuff/seeing the wrong stuff &amp; leave for new apps with less overload<br />All those new apps grow until...</p>— Benedict Evans (@benedictevans) <a href="https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/955539670103859200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2018</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>I would already kill for better timeline organisation. Sure there is no incentive to move to algorithms that engage users more due to the paid nature of the platform. Stepping away from micro.blog, it’s obvious where the trend goes for almost every other social platform that attempts to be moderation free. I am lucky in the fact I have placed my eggs in a basket I trust, Manton and the team have no reason to do anything other that tend to this nice positive garden they have created. Others are not so lucky.</p><p>Almost every platform that attempts to be a <em>safe place</em> for a certain type of person falls flat on their face with this problem of scale. You can promise to be moderation free, or simply not have the time to do it, but the fact is it’s impossible to run a platform that doesn’t have to do moderation.</p><p>Start with the spam you’ll inevitably get once there are enough users. Then the things you legally have to take down — abuse, copyright material etc. Once you reach a critical mass of users, then comes the algorithmic feed decisions due to lack of engagement and inability for users to keep up. This too is an inevitability as users can’t decide if their posts will be seen or not and start to post less if action isn’t taken.</p><p>All platforms that need engagement or show adverts will devolve into the same state eventually. Nothing will ever ‘fix’ social media. Scale kills almost everything, there is a huge benifit to <strong>not</strong> being where everyone is. Stay small.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’d like to say this was in my younger years, but until fairly recently I bought loads of stuff because I thought I wanted it. Wasted thousands on tech purchases and waved any dismissive thoughts away with the reasoning that it was my only vice. Upgraded my phone, tablet, computer, and anything I could get my hands on almost constantly in a search for something better. When in fact it wasn’t better it was looking for, it was an answer.</p>
<p>The next model of iPhone was always the one that would fill what I was looking for. No? It must be the next one coming in a few months then, or maybe I needed an iPad to go with it. Whatever the feelings left after the hit of dopamine had subsided, it was explained away with buying something else.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f77b66b4b3.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" /></p>
<p>That wasn’t what I was searching for though, I wanted something to fill another hole in myself. It didn’t matter what the hole was, but I filled it with buying tech. Simply because I thought it made me look cool on the internet. Although every upgrade offered me <em>something</em>, these things are not what I needed. What I, and load of people like me, needed was to get to the root of what I really wanted. What was I trying to mask and fill with buying things?</p>
<p>It wasn’t until discovering minimalism that I became aware fo the feelings I had. Like many people I talk to, the <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80114460">Netflix documentary</a> introduced me to a way of looking at the more essential things in life. Thinking much harder about the things I choose to put in it. This isn’t an advert for minimalism, but the message given is a powerful one. The thing I needed was not a thing at all, and for different people it is different things — but one thing links us all, it’s not stuff we need.</p>
<p>These feelings haven’t gone away, I don’t think they ever will. They are still there, I bought every size of iPhone <a href="/2020/11/21/the-iphone-line.html">simply because I could</a>, but how I deal with them is different. Being aware of feelings and the reasons behind them has been an important step in improving my overall happiness and seems to have curbed the never-ending search for fulfilment. Much simpler things make me content now, and when these pangs of purchases come I ride them out and think about what the root cause really is. It’s me.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Last year I wrote about my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-cant-go">desire to move completely away from smartphones</a> in general and detach myself from the internet as much as I could. With this comes the juxtaposition and the realisation with the fact that I work online, and simply need access to things a smartphone can do most of the time.</p><p>Despite <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-iphone-line">flirting with every size iPhone 12</a> I have stuck with the 12 mini and this has enabled me to go back as far as I can. With a few tweaks such as <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-phone-has">moving my phone out of my room</a>, I have enabled myself to deal with the internet at prescribed times, and in ways I want to.</p><p>This is no fault of the internet. These issues are in me, but also affect those around me. These issues are completely self-made. It’s not the apps I have installed. It’s not the designers fault. It’s not anyone else’s fault. It’s mine. Because I feel bad, I think that it’s outside things making me feel this way and I look for a fix. A quick one preferably, to stop this constant pressure I feel. Instead of working on myself and understanding the triggers.</p><p>A smaller phone has helped me not reach for it as much. As has moving it out of my sleeping space. They are not the cause of my issues, but a way of me fixing them and understanding my triggers. I have gone back as far as I can, and I am much happier than I ever have been, not because of a smartphone, just because I am the person I want to be.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Justin Tadlock discussing the <a href="https://wptavern.com/yes-comments-are-still-relevant-but-we-need-a-better-system">relevancy of comments</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Commenting on and discussing ideas in an open forum can change hearts and minds. It can lead to discoveries and create life-long friendships — I still routinely chat with people I met through blogs and their comments from nearly two decades ago.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I love comments, but then I don’t really have much of a community outside of friends I’ve met online. Outside a few spambots I have never received anything other than nice feedback or healthy debate. But…</p>
<p>Comments on popular platforms such as YouTube can be an absolute dumpster fire. As someone who publishes videos for my day job I am constantly removing comments on videos that showcase the worst that humanity has to offer.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Ryan McCue, a core contributor to WordPress, said that <a href="https://twitter.com/rmccue/status/1375873040496594946" title="comments should be a plugin">comments should be a plugin</a>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I strongly agree with this, the default option for anything on a blog, web, video whatever should be comments off, and you turn them off by default.</p>
<p>Openness when being able to choose a comment provider should also be the de facto stance from all platforms. If I want to move hosts or anything else, I want to take my comments with me.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  McCue’s response was to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Krogsgard/status/1375867036102971396" title="tweet by Brian Krogsgard">tweet by Brian Krogsgard</a>, the Post Status creator and editor. “WordPress should have one singular button that says: Turn off all comments and comment displays. This is so hilariously complicated, it’s absurd.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Comments on WordPress are so far behind where they should be it’s a joke at this point. Dating the way they look and feel is impossible without editing core WordPress files and good luck in understanding what options do what. I spent a good few hours configuring Webmentions as comments and allowing them to be displayed, when it would have been a 2-minute job.</p>
<p>I, the publisher should own the comments the same as I own my content, so making them a plugin would be the perfect move. Don’t even get me started on the non movement of <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35435" title="ticket for supporting webmentions">implementing Webmention</a> after 5 years.</p>
<p>Comments should be part and parcel of your life online. However, all roads point to something better. You will get fools, but you’ll get them on social media anyway, but better tool are needed to breathe life back into something so important to the web.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  And finally, it has been a healthy reminder that the internet can push anyone down a rabbit hole towards believing something false. We all try to be rationale people, and we’re all convinced that what we believe is reasonable and other people are crazy, but none of us are above being pushed into weird (and sometimes dangerous) beliefs with just a few clicks.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I constantly read that people that believe in conspiracy theories or have outlying views on the world are stupid and should know better. If you fall for miss information, or just form your views a bit differently to others then you almost deserve it because you’re dumb. That may be the case for the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ideas-jason-pontin-less-speech/">weird and wonderful</a>, but as Matt points out above its really hard to work out what’s true on the internet.</p>
<p>As much as on the internet no one knows you’re a dog, no one knows your true intent for what you publish. Everyone falls down these holes, and it’s important to remember that.</p>

<blockquote><p>Wherever I traveled on the internet, I saw my own data reflected back at me: if a jade face-roller stalked me from news site to news site, I was reminded of my red skin and passive vanity. If the personalized playlists were full of sad singer-songwriters, I could only blame myself for getting the algorithm depressed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Living inside an algorithm, like we all do, has no upsides. We are all stuck seeing everything that people ‘like us’ are doing. Ourselves reflected back at us and informing the choices we make next. We’re pigeonholed and controlled by an algorithm that makes it almost impossible to break out of.</p>
<p>Even when we do, and come across someone who doesn’t have the same feelings towards things we do, trouble is bound to happen. Other people don’t understand us as much as the machines, and as such other view points get us upset. The world online thinks the same as us, so why doesn’t the larger world outside?</p>
<p>This is further exaggerated when you live in somewhere like Silicon Valley where the online world is built by the people in your outside world. Shudder.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The world online would have us believe that everyone else’s life is better than ours. No matter how great the universe is when you look around you, there are always ones that appear better. You can stare at the photos, read the words and watch the videos and never fail pick out things you wish for your own. It’s easy to see positives in others but not in yourself.</p>
<p>Even if the portrayal is far from the truth. Others internet lives are, on the surface, perfect. Everyone else is always living their best life, enjoying things better than your experiences or doing a better job of it anyway. Almost everything appears better on the outside. The grass always appears greener, but the grass is fake.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see — Henry David Thoreau
</p></blockquote>
<p>The surface is an easy place to observe, it’s the place easy for us to understand, free of the complexities that lie just beneath it. We cannot take everything in, there is simply too much information for us to process, so we focus instead on what we wish to see, and when a lot of what we see is airbrushed it’s impossible to see negatives.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/507fba3ac7.jpg" width="333" height="222" alt="" /></p>
<p>This isn’t a new problem, it’s easy to <a href="/2020/09/09/its-not-the.html">blame the internet</a>, but the internet is full of content others publish. After all, why would you want to show pictures of yourself not in the best light, or having a bad time? What a weird Instagram that would be if the images were what people were <em>actually</em> doing every day. As much as the modern phrase of “it’s OK to not be OK” is spoken, it is not OK to not be your best on the internet.</p>
<p>You can speak of pressure from beauty standards, advertising, and more modern-day worries until you ar blue in the face. The self-fulfilling prophecy is unbreakable, until you realise that this is all fake. It’s easy to see positives, it’s easy to focus on the worries you already have, and it’s natural to see what you want to see.</p>
<p>Your feed is the edited highlights, and so is everyone else’s. Wishing for other lives, other bodies, others income is easy when all you see are the nice bits.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>My daughters toy says this to me every time I hand it to her. Its nighttime based vocal cues and music prods her towards winding down and going to sleep. For <a href="/2016/12/27/oh-hello-am.html">how long who knows</a>, but it helps her drift off. I’ve never really paid attention to this until today whilst thinking about the very same things.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’m not old, but I’m not as fast as I used to be — me to my wife after a run
</p></blockquote>
<p>Whilst trying to up my <a href="/2021/02/15/why-do-i.html">running</a> millage now the weather is better, I am forever having to tell myself to slow down. My legs are stuck in this weird pace that I can handle for 10k but not for much longer and I have a habit of blowing up with too many miles to go. A lesson I should have learnt by now, but one that doesn’t just stop at running. I also have a sustained habit of <a href="/2021/02/16/cross-posting-to.html">tweeting too fast</a>, thinking too fast and hitting projects too hard too soon.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dd1cfee040.jpg" width="600" height="403" alt="" /></p>
<p>Try as I might, I just can’t slow myself down some times. I haven’t expanded the internal monologue that happens whist running to the rest of my life. It’s a lesson that I have read quite a <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/twitter-idea-delayed-tweets/">few times</a> lately and one I needed to add my support too. I have recently been introduced to the GTD tag of “<a href="https://productivityist.com/using-energy-levels-as-contexts/">high energy</a>” and this makes perfect sense to me. Don’t go hard all the time, slow down and go hard when you can.</p>
<p>Slow doesn’t mean as slow as possible it just means slower than you might expect. Doing things at the correct pace is one of life’s biggest lessons. That pace is going to be different for different people, and different times of day and hell even different periods of time. We are constantly encouraged to move faster, work harder and fill every waking moment with something that others deem important. When in fact it’s time to slow down, do things properly and maintain them for longer.</p>
<p>When it comes to tweeting, maybe just don’t instead.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s only a few months since I covered <a href="/2020/08/22/my-reading-flow.html">my reading flow</a>. It’s something that has changed a lot in the last year due. Motivated by my desire to take more advantage of the time spent engrossed in a book or catching up on my queue of online articles. This doesn’t matter when and where I am doing this, but one thing I’ve come to rely on is highlighting and being able to read them back.</p>
<p>Only when testing two new upcoming reading apps (super top secret sorry) that are yet to implement highlights that I realised how important they are. Without even thinking I draw my finger across the screen to highlight a specific sentence or passage that I want to remember. When that doesn’t happen, I don’t feel like I am getting the best I can out of this experience.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b0c949c9ae.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" /></p>
<p>Many things slide past without needing to be highlighted, but more than a few times I have had to put the article into another app so I can save the highlights for later. I <em>could</em> try to do this with <a href="/categories/shortcuts/">Shortcuts</a>, but there is something about being able to see what you’ve read and which bits are important. Remember how satisfying it felt to bust out the marker and highlight things on your school texts?</p>
<p>These highlights typically end up on social media, lead to a<a href="https://gr36.com/categories/link-posts/">link post</a> or are saved to refer to later. <a href="https://readwise.io">Readwise</a> definitely helps with pushing these into <a href="/2020/08/21/how-to-start.html">Roam</a> for me, but there are a huge number of ways to read these highlights back and let the information sync in better. If you are thinking about using a service, or creating a new one, highlighting should be top of your list.</p>
<p>Not everything needs highlighting, but everything needs to be able to be highlighted.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  A common experience I have as an unbearable software nerd: I get a peek at a system that a prolific person uses to create their prolific output and think “God, Microsoft Word? Are you an animal?”</p>
<p>  I then go back to tinkering with my Grand System which has generated nothing yet.</p>
<p>  While I do think it’s a tragedy that any person is still using Microsoft Word, I’m looking in exactly the wrong direction.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t know if it’s because I’m blinkered by my life online but I spent this whole post thinking about how this relates to blogging and writing.</p>
<p>Over the years I wasted so much time messing around with my blog that I spent less time putting out posts — and I know <a href="https://micro.blog/JeffPerry/11240196">others do this too</a>.</p>
<p>That’s not what people come for. Sure a nice blog design makes it easier to read things, but there’s little point if there is nothing to read anyway. The system is less important than the things we put into it, so do that first before worrying.</p>

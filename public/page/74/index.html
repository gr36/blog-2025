  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Every single advert you see on Tv has a pretty simple message. It wants you to be motivated enough to buy the stuff it is selling. They do this in a myriad of different ways, approach each one with a different angle or perhaps a different message, but the overall message delivered is ~you~ are not good enough without this thing.</p>
<p>Your body isn’t good enough, your hair, your clothes, the car you drive, even the food you eat. Nothing that you are currently doing, or anything about your own self, is good enough compared to this thing. Just look at how happy these people are, having loads of fun and smiling all the time. Don’t you want to smile too?</p>
<p>When you buy this thing, and only this thing we are selling, you will instantly feel better about yourself. You’ll be more attractive, look better and the sun will always shine. Of course when you do buy extra stuff you do feel good, at first. However it soon wears off and you will return to your normal state, and now feel bad for spending money and achieving nothing. So if buying this didn’t work, what <strong>is</strong> the answer?</p>
<p>It’s getting something else of course. Now you’ve got this thing, here’s another thing to buy, and perhaps you will feel happy with that one instead. Around and around it goes, accumulating stuff, because you’re not enough, spending money you don’t have because banks will lead you money to help you have enough. All in search of something you are told you’ve lost.</p>
<p>At what point <strong>are</strong> you enough? Where is your breaking point on this cycle of hate? Many people get all of these things and only <em>then</em> realise that they don’t make any difference. A truth we know right at the start.</p>
<p>You are enough already, you have enough to make you happy — and even if you don’t, accumulating stuff isn’t the answer.</p>
<p>You’re the answer. You’re enough. You’re awesome.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>David Nield <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-tell-which-emails-track-you/">gives some advice on email tracking and how to stop it</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Tracking pixels can report the times and dates their associated email was opened, as well as the location of the device used, and the email client involved. That’s a lot of data to feed back to a third-party that you might not know much about.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I knew these kind of things existed, but until I <a href="https://gr36.com/favourite-hey-features/">started using Hey</a> I never understood what an epidemic this is. Understanding your marketing data is absolutely essential, I have skin in that game. Analytics of mass emails is absolutely essential to filling your customers needs — but the current levels of usage is frankly ridiculous.</p>
<p>Why on earth do you need to track your newsletter? Yes I see you, attempting to see when I open and on what device for absolutely no reason other than your ego. Stop joining in with the attention economy to satisfy your own need for validation. I’ve subscribed, I read it, it’s great. Isn’t that enough?</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I kept control of <a href="https://gr36.com/greg-thinks-things-future/">my own emails</a> because services like Substack either don’t, or certainly don’t appear to, allow you to turn tracking off. Reporting back to a third party what <em>your</em> email subscribers are doing is doing yourself a disservice and letting your readers down. Tracking marketing and needing to see some return for your investment is one thing, but letting <em>someone else</em> collect data that you have no control over is another.</p>
<p>Hopefully we see the same attention to data collection we have seen in browsers extend to more email clients going forward.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Bringing a lot of stress, things not being as organized, many little tasks within projects falling through the cracks. Because of it, I had realized that I needed to fix my system. I don’t want things to fall though, I don’t want to rely on my mental notes, “Oh I’ll remember that later” or “I will make a note of it later”. I am very forgetful, and more so now that I’ve got lots on my plate.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Every so often my busy life calms down a bit and I stop using <a href="https://gr36.com/todoist-organise-my-life/">Todoist</a> and slope back to reminders or sometimes nothing at all. It’s at this point I start forgetting things and not getting all of those things out of my brain.</p>
<p>There really is no replacement for getting into a good task management system but many people look to apps rather than themselves. <a href="https://gr36.com/a-new-productivity-app-wont-make-you-more-productive/">A new app rarely changes</a> things for a long period of time unless you build a robust system too. But it certainly helps to get you started!</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>You may have noticed my absence from almost absolutely everything over the weekend. No blogging, no posting, and very little social media updates other than a few <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17884476947085317/">Instagram stories</a> celebrating each mini victory. Thats because I had a weekend filled with pain and very little sleep running 48 miles over two days.</p><p>I ran four miles, every four hours, for 48 hours and it was the most challenging thing I have ever done. I learnt a lot about myself and what I can actually do, all thanks to deciding to do something nuts to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/gr36">raise money for charity</a>. It has pushed me to awfully close to the limits in pain endurance, sleep deprivation and sheer mental toughness and I have to say I enjoyed it!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/e0fca394cd.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>Looking back at the fitness stats it looks insane! I reached 640% of my move goal (600) on Saturday and more than 400% on Sunday also. Burning around 7,800 calories in three days is just mind blowing for me to think about. Sure, a long bike ride can equal it but combined with the stopping and starting every 4 hours meant it felt much worse than even running a marathon. I took in very little as my stomach just wouldn’t tolerate much, so I think I’ve dropped quite a bit of weight too! But enough about me.</p><p>Thank you to all of those that donated to <a href="https://newlifecharity.co.uk">Newlife Charity</a>, this is one very close to my heart and one that has helped me out tremendously when no one else would. The thoughts of the children and families they help kept me going during the dark moments. Particularly those in the middle of the night, when every finer of my body is screaming at me to stop running. I was able to focus on getting through each run at a time knowing the money would be used to help people that are not as lucky as me, and desperately need support.</p><p>But this isn’t a sales pitch, it’s not a plea for more money, not a grab for attention. It is a thank you, those that have supported me through this, sent me message and congratulated me on the completion means a lot to me. When times are tough, I know people can pull together and offer support in whatever way they can.</p><p>Once again thank you to those that donated. I am resting up and recovering well.</p>

<blockquote><p>
the TVs come with features like built-in Chromecast, Google Assistant (hands-free in some models), and later this year Google Stadia game streaming.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Whilst everyone seems to presume Stadia is dying it’s quietly starting to come built into TVs. With rumours circling that LG will be following suit, it looks like the benefits of giving away controllers and making deals with theirs parties <em>may</em> pay off.</p>

<p>For the longest time I have been a huge supporter of keeping iOS locked down as tight as possible. Not budging a single inch, because that is what is best for the consumer, and I shudder a little when I think about a future with Android style ‘openness’ on my iPhone.</p>
<p>Sure, Android provides much more customisation than iOS. It allows you to do a lot more things. Not absolutely anything you want, but not far off it. But it’s a long time since I desired anything like that from my phone, and much prefer the tap square get app way that iOS works — that’s just me. I would still <a href="https://gr36.com/ill-gladly-pay-extra-for-apple-to-manage-my-payments/">gladly pay more for Apple to manage all my payments</a>, and if truth be told I trust them much more than any other brand. I’m <a href="https://gr36.com/not-being-a-fan-boy-is-hard/">no fan boy</a>, but when it comes to putting all my information on a bit of technology, I just trust them more and have confidence in the decisions they make to keep my information on my phone.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Apple App Store is so full of scammers and so lousy at search that if Apple ever did allow third party stores it is certain that a properly curated third party store would be much safer for users. So Apple arguing that the App Store makes users safer is utterly bogus.</p>

<p>With all these things said. This trust I have in my fruity overlord is slipping, very quickly, and stories like the above keep popping up. I don’t ever think Apple will give up control of their platform, and nor should they, but they need to seriously step their game up to prove Apple’s arguments correct. Keeping control needs to be better for customers and as it currently stands, <em>it is</em> but not by a lot.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I know what most people think straight away. How many of todays posts are going to be about Apple watches? It was my first thought, because I do love my watch, but something more important watch related currently.</p>
<p>The world is in lockdown and we are all running out of stuff to watch. I feel like I have consumed the entire catalogue of Netflix series that are any good, and a few that were terrible but it couldn’t stop watching them (has anyone watched <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80178724">Living With Yourself?</a>) just for something to do. Currently we are rewatching Sons Of Anarchy, and I’d forgotten most of what happens so some of it is new to me and after then we are a bit stuck.</p>
<p>Amazon Prime has some ok shows, but isn’t packed full of top notch series. American Gods is pretty, but very slow going considering the book is one of my all time favourites. So my question is — what you watching?</p>
<p>TV series and playing games have been really useful for me during lockdown to unwind and a few shows to keep me going would be great!</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>This game has been the best one I have picked up in ages. Yes I am aware I keep banging on about it.</p>
<p>I don’t play loads, I try and grab 20-30 minutes at a time on work breaks or in the evening but I’ve really enjoyed playing. It’s made me fall in love with gaming again, and because I can play Stadia anywhere it suits me perfectly. More than the Switch ever did, but I’m not quite sure why.</p>
<p>But playing again has meant I now allow myself to relax more and just chill when I always felt like I was wasting time before. It’s a mental swift that I really needed during lockdown and one I fell into by accident. 🎮</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I often wonder why I publish things to the internet. It doesn’t matter if it’s a tweet, a photo or a full-on blog post, the whole idea of it seems futile when you really think about things. I don’t show ads, I don’t have a Patreon, I don’t make any money at all, so what <em>is</em> the point.</p>
<p>Yet there is one. Take for example the <a href="/categories/how-to/">‘How To”</a> guides that I write. They get next to no views in the grand scheme of my posts, but they inform some people so it’s worthwhile writing. I once get a nice email form someone stuck with their Lumia 950, and they found my how to guide (which is long gone) and manage to fix their issue when nothing else did.</p>
<p>To be honest most of these guides I write for myself because I need to refer to them later when I enviably forget how I did something. Yet informing that one person of what to do, makes all the hassle worthwhile.</p>
<p>The same goes for writing about the ideas and thoughts that I have, most of the time they slip by people without being read. Yet sometimes, just occasionally, I get a nice tweet or some feedback to say that’s for writing this because I feel the same but didn’t know how to express it.</p>
<p>So, writing to inform people is not what I do. My days of writing 3-5 news articles a day on tech news are long gone. Yet my blogging does get through to some people, and even if they don’t I love doing it. My blog is a bit like a digital journal that I often look back on, and I can feel the emotions I had when writing them. Some tell me things will get better, some tell me to never go back to that place, but they tell me something and that’s its own reward.</p>

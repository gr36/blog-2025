     <p>You know that horrible experience when you first buy a car, and then you see loads of the same one coming in the opposite direction all the time. It’s a known human cognitive bias, the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon, I know it’s false, but I am experiencing it with vertical things at the minute and I can’t work out where it is going.</p>
<p>It started on Saturday when I was running (donate to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024">London For Lucie</a> by the way!) and listening to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/1/23855476/today-on-the-vergecast-happy-techtember-everybody">The Vergecast</a>. In which they were talking about all video apps being the same, just consuming each other’s ideas and increasing the length of vertical video viewable in apps. Which is interesting considering, as they point out, a service like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quibi">Quibi</a>, despite it terrible name, might not have been the worst idea ever. An idea explored in <a href="https://wondery.com/shows/the-big-flop/episode/13847-quibi-bites-the-dust-with-connor-ratliff-amp-matt-bellassai/">episode 1 of The Big Flop</a>. Smartphone users really like vertical videos, and it feels much more natural.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b17e17aed9.jpg" alt="" title="Image from Kapwig"></p>
<p>This started a flash back to weird marketing events I have been to where people have discussed vertical video and very much switched off (I hate those type of events). I began to wonder just how much do people prefer watching vertical videos because it does make a lot of sense for many situations, but everything bar the smartphone sticks to horizontal. Of course, you can find stats <a href="https://www.animaker.com/blog/vertical-video-facebook-ads-case-study/">all</a> <a href="https://www.aarki.com/blog/driving-higher-engagement-with-vertical-video">over</a> <a href="https://www.impactplus.com/blog/vertical-video-in-marketing-infographic">the</a> <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/vertical-video/">place</a>, but turns out – it’s a lot.</p>
<p>Still seems odd to me outside of quick scrolling social media, but I’m not one to argue with the stats and considering how old I am, my opinions could just be the old guy shouting at the clouds again. It just made me think back to a few years ago when any person filming vertical video would have been chastised. Now it is not only the norm, but it is expected. This also got me questioning many things.</p>
<p>There’s new <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/lifestyle-tvs/the-sero/">TV’s with vertical modes</a>, <a href="https://ergomounts.co.uk/product/infinity-series-vertical-tv-floor-stand/">floor stands to make yours do it</a>, and all sorts of products pushing vertical monitors. It seems absurd at first, but when you stop and think about it, it makes a lot of sense. I’m a bit stuck with a reason on actual TVs, but websites, apps and almost any user interface I come across has the majority of its elements in a vertical stack. This got me thinking about my work, mainly being in web UI and Print design (which is nearly all vertical). I had side eyed the oddly shaped LG DualUp when it was first launched, thinking it made sense at the time – so I bought one.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/74088e7469.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It was relatively cheap in the world on monitors, and comes with a really nice ergonomic arm, so I feel like I got a good deal. However, as soon as I placed it down on my desk (well, clamped it to it) I felt conflicted. As much as the size and orientation makes sense, it just feels strange. That all went away when using it, though. The build quality, screen resolution and portrait set up means I am over the moon with it. Why on earth I didn’t pull the rigger before I will never know, maybe I have been indoctrinated by the previous landscape based world. However, now I am free!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the consume side, that means that your home feed has no Algorithm (big-A “Algorithm”). This can be disorienting at first when coming from X and FB. Practically, it means that you see only what you want to see and only see it linearly. You never wonder, “why am I seeing this and how do I make it go away?”.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am completely convinced that users both want algorithmic timelines, but they need one. There is some research to back this up <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-just-proved-people-hate-chronological-feeds/#:~:text=When%20they%20scrolled%20through%20their,such%20as%20YouTube%20and%20TikTok.">from Meta</a>, but others found <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-people-want-social-media-feeds-ordered">the opposite</a>, so take from that what you will. However, in my opinion, it is only tech nerds that shout the loudest because we feel as if we need to complete our timeline as if it is a video game. When, in fact, users want to follow loads of people but only be shown the good stuff from their circles.</p>
<p>The biggest reason users complain is when companies don&rsquo;t get it right, and not many companies have managed that. No one wants a chronological feed on TikTok or Netflix, and that&rsquo;s because the algorithm is complete seamless. Using your consumption data to get the right things in your face at the right time.</p>
<p>Granted, you could argue this is because they are not ad networks and are not bothered about showing you them. They do, however, need to keep you engaged, and watching things. So they ensure their suggestions are as good as they possibly can be. We’ve all had the odd bad experience on these platforms, but there’s no scrambling for a long list of the latest things launched.</p>
<p>Could you imagine if both of these platforms got it as wrong as Twitter does?</p>

<p>I have just realised that between <a href="/2023/08/28/week.html">last week&rsquo;s update</a> and this one I only wrote, one blog post. I am certain that some weeks have been even worse, but seeing it so easily makes me want to get my ass into gear and publish more. Perhaps you will see more before next week&rsquo;s post? Don’t hold your breath!</p>
<ul>
<li>If I can be allowed to start at the end of the week and work backwards, I watched Arsenal destroy Man United yesterday and there are not many better feelings than this. Watching it with my brother-in-law who is a United fan made it even sweeter.</li>
<li>Yesterday I deleted my Instagram account. It became too much of a time suck and fed my ego to a point where I took a break for a week or so. This finally made me realise how little I need it in my life, and <a href="/2023/09/03/logged-in-to.html">the final straw</a> was on checking in on Thread I wasn’t allowed to disable my account again for a week. So, instead, it has been deleted – don’t look for me there.</li>
<li>This week was my best week for a long time running. I racked up 35 miles all told. I realise this isn’t a long way, but it is a gigantic boost to me, and my lungs are starting to feel much better. I have months of training to go, but I am starting to believe I can do it. Donate to London for Lucie <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024">here</a>.</li>
<li>I took delivery of a new monitor for my home working office. It is the <a href="https://www.lg.com/uk/monitors/ergo-monitors/28mq780-b/">LG DualUp – which</a> is taking some getting used to. The monitor itself is portrait rather than landscape and has great reviews online. I work mostly in print work, and websites, both of which are portrait, so this should work better than a wider monitor or another one on the side.</li>
<li>Someone is working very hard this week to break into my Facebook account. I mean, I don’t even really have one apart from a blank shell to manage my business pages, but I get 3-4 password reset emails a day. It’s fun.</li>
<li>We also attended a friend&rsquo;s christening, which was really fun. Meeting with our group of friends and spending time laughing and joking was great. Lucie thoroughly enjoyed walking around because she knows everyone and believe me, everyone knows her!</li>
</ul>
<p>I would rather not mention my flip phone adventures, it is for another time, so you will have to stay tuned. I will always be here and pretty much nowhere else now. Take care of yourselves, have a wonderful week.</p>

     <p>Matt Birchler on <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/let-the-internet-run-out/">letting the internet run out</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a world where we all struggle with how much we use our devices (let’s be real, we mean our phones), I think it’s kinda nice to have some places that just give up and tell us, “my dude, you’ve read it all, go do something else.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I read this and nodded along, like most posts Matt publishes because it’s easy to agree with things you know to be true. It wasn’t until a few days later when that I realised just how prevalent, and desired, the endless feed is.</p>
<p>The loudest voices are often ones that scream for chronological timelines, but the reality is most users don’t want that. They want to be endlessly distracted at any moment. Both companies and the majority of users would like to have a constant stream of entertainment, there’s no reason to have an end really is there. An end of the feed would mean the user leaves, opens another app and continues to mindlessly scroll. That’s not good for the bottom line now, is it?</p>
<p>Like Matt, I too love an app that comes to an end. Sure, it might be frustrating when I need some entertainment, but it gives me pause to think if that is really what I want to be doing. Occasionally, that answer is yes, and there’s no shortage of places to go on the internet, but more often than not the answer is no. Even a small little pause <a href="https://one-sec.app/#:~:text=It%27s%20as%20simple%20as%20effective,makes%20distracting%20apps%20less%20appealing.">causes most people to think about what they are doing</a> and close the app. Hitting the end of the feed doesn’t always feel like a good thing, but it always is.</p>

<p>I am sure he will forgive me, but I always read <a href="https://maique.eu/2023/08/28/thingsthisweek.html">thingsThisWeek</a> by Maique and like the idea of small updates of the things I have been up to. So without further fuss, here’s mine.</p>
<p>This week was ups and downs as usual. Filled full of some working and some days off due to bank holidays and skilfully timed annual leave. I spent a lot of it trying to relax, failing, and also trying to <a href="/2023/08/19/trying-to-get.html">run a little more</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yesterday we went to meet another little girl with the same genetic condition as Lucie. It’s wonderful to think that something so rare, about 50 people have it worldwide, can affect two little girls just down the road from each other.</li>
<li>I have been a bit slack on some of my important routines over the summer holidays. For example, journalling and meditating. I discovered I can <a href="https://todoist.com/integrations/apps/habit-tracker">track habits in Todoist</a> so set this up for a few essential ones with reminders. It is working well.</li>
<li>On the Todoist front, I have been leaning on more digital tools recently. I wrote about my <a href="/2023/08/26/notebooks-in-summer.html">summer issues with carrying a notebook</a>, but even with digital tools I have tried to bring over good analogue habits.</li>
<li>This week, I have spent some time thinking about what I want my blog to be and working on some theme updates. With this in mind, I have set up <a href="https://tinylytics.app/">tinylytics</a>, the excellent service from <a href="https://vincentritter.com/?ts=gr36">Vincent</a>, just for the ‘like’ button. You will notice an improved comment and reply section below.</li>
<li>My running is going slightly better this week than last. I’ve been slowly plodding around some miles. I still feel like I might have to give up at any moment, but the great charity I am doing it for keeps me going. I’d love it if you would donate <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024">here</a>.</li>
<li>Had to take a bit of a break from all social media after American politics reared its ugly head again. It seems to have calmed down a bit again, so I’m checking in every so often – but mostly publishing without visiting anything.</li>
<li>I’ve got plenty of thoughts about my <a href="/2023/08/23/my-big-flip.html">use of a flip hone again</a>. I need to get around to writing these up, but every time I try it becomes really preachy, and I would rather not publish that. Safe to say my mind feels a bit better, but I have relented and wearing my Apple Watch again. I’m not certain how, but it still gives me Todoist notifications and the like, but it’s mainly for tracking runs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you all have a great week this week, and you know where I am if you need me. 🤙</p>

     <p>After months of carrying around my notebook constantly. Through thick and thin, whatever the occasion. Do you know what killed it? Summer. My field notes and everyday inspiration cover doesn’t really fit with my baggy summer shorts, and that kind of sucks.</p>
<p>Months on end, this thing stuck with me. Containing all my notes, thoughts, blog post ideas and most importantly all the things I have to do. Now it’s just on my desk at work and comes out every now and again if I have a meeting. Perhaps I am going to have to change my wardrobe for next year.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. It doesn’t care. Unlike all the apps on my phone, it’s not pinging and prodding me to pick it up if I put it doesn’t for more than 5 minutes. I just feel bad for not experiencing all the positives it had brought me. I won’t go into them here, but it’s safe to say a notebook is the biggest improvement I made in my life for a long time.</p>
<p>I do find it a bit silly that something as silly as a slightly bulging pocket ruins it. So I’m trying to make a concerted effort to get back into the habit. The summer weather in the UK has been a bit crap this year, so I will probably be back in jeans by next week.</p>

     <p>I’ve always liked the idea of a digital garden, even tried to set one up a few times, but never really managed to make one stick. Well, perhaps that’s not strictly true, I do have one in Apple notes, but it’s not a published one.</p>
<p>The appeal comes from my note-taking itself. I write them obsessively, about anything and everything. They evolve all the time. Get overwritten, rewritten and added too as much as new ones sprout up, and that is perhaps what I would like my blog to be.</p>
<p>Blog posts are often seen as rigid things. An unmoving line in the dirt of what we think and the things we believe in. Whereas, much like my note-taking, the thoughts, and motivations for them evolve and change. They age just like the rest of our thoughts. The things we write and publish online should not be thought of as rigid things. Instead of being pushed out to the world at one point, they should be allowed to change over time.</p>
<p>This style of note-taking is typically referred to as Evergreen notes by those that like to tend their online digital gardens. They fluctuate far more than your traditional blog posts, and can offer much more in return. Blog posts, however, are the opposite. Deciduous, if you will. Sure, you <em>can</em> go back and update blog posts or link to new ones, but they are typically just left to stagnate. Left as a reflection of one point in time. Barely revisited. Wilting away. Which kind of makes me sad.</p>

     <p>I’m not sure what has caused this feeling. <a href="/2020/08/09/i-cant-go.html" title="2021-04-16  3:26 pm">These motivations</a> have existed <a href="/2021/12/08/putting-in-some.html">for a while</a>, but <a href="/2021/04/16/back-as-far.html">never quite reached</a> this level of motivation, my desire to ditch my phone has reached the levels I have never experienced before, and I’ve gone and done it. For the next 4 weeks, at least, I will be back to using a flip phone, so I figured I might as well get some blog posts (and entertainment) out of it while I navigate this weirdness.</p>
<p>A week or so ago, I was doing the yearly practice of <a href="/2023/08/15/its-that-time.html">trying to work out when</a> the new iPhone should come out, and when the best time to sell my current version would be. It’s a fine line between having to use a backup phone for a while and getting the most for a device that will drop in price the closer to the iPhone event we get. I usually go back to using my trusty first generation iPhone SE for a week or so, and by the end of it I am ready to throw it in the bin. This year, my SE has not risen from the ashes, and so I’ve opted for something more radical.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/38056de2d4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Listen, I’ve been banging on about hating my phone but needing to use it for ages, but never done anything drastic before. I’m uncertain if it is because <a href="/2023/08/23/currently-reading-stolen.html" title="5:21 pm">I’m reading Stolen Focus by Johann Hart</a> presently, or I’m just getting my yearly internet annoyance period. Whatever the motivation for it is, my SIM card is now in a Nokia 2660 Flip phone that cost me a whole £25. Well, actually two of them are, my work phone and my personal number because this phone is Dual sim (and that’s about the only useful thing about it).</p>
<p>In the first few hours, I’ve already had a panic because I couldn’t check how much money was in my bank account before I made a purchase. I’ve also been teased relentlessly by my wife and son for daring to take a call in public on it, but I think I am getting there. I will no doubt hit numerous road blocks along the way, and might end up stomping into town to buy a cheap iPhone, but it will be amusing for everyone to watch (or read about) anyway.</p>

     <p>As most people will already be aware, I’m <a href="/2023/08/02/london-for-lucie.html">running the London Marathon</a> to raise funds for the Epilepsy Society. A charity very close to my heart. Although the run isn’t until April 2024, I need to start ramping up my running in preparation and unfortunately, this is proving more difficult than I thought.</p>
<p>In December 2021, I got my third COVID-19 vaccine, the so-called winter booster. This started one of the biggest issues I’ve had to overcome in my life because it threw my life into chaos. I’d not experienced any side effects to the other two shots, but immediately following this one I didn’t feel myself and still don’t. After a few weeks of suffering, I discovered I had issues with my heart and lungs, leaving me unable to even walk very far without feeling out of breath.</p>
<p>This was devastating to me. I’ve always been active, <a href="/2021/03/09/i-did-it.html">raising money for charity</a> and running was <a href="/2021/02/15/why-do-i.html">one of my favourite</a> things to do. The inability to do much affected my mental health and my family, and that still continues to this day. Although I am much better than I have been, running and placing too much stress on my system has been frustrating.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/acfb82c727.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I thought that these issues were starting to wear off, but as soon as I’ve tried to run again, doing anything but a mild pace results in my lungs hating me for days afterwards. So I’m trying to take this really slow and steady, but I think the pace I used to run at is ingrained in my legs.</p>
<p>I’m aiming to run the 26.2 miles in around 4:30, which is slow but a pace achievable for me. This is a little over 10 minute miles or 6:23 kilometres. My plan was to start off at this pace and increase my mileage very slowly over time. Yet, trying to slow myself down for my bodies sake, takes too much concentration at the minute. Any time I try to switch off and enjoy the run, my legs start speeding up again!</p>
<div class="london box">
<h2>Donate to London For Lucie</h2></a>
</div>
<p>Within a few minutes, I realise I’m going too fast because my lungs are telling me off and I have to slow down again. It’s a ridiculous problem to have, and one that results in me running around a minute per km too fast. This has also put some stress on my body that I didn’t want, and my breathing is suffering at the minute. There is no question about me keeping going, but I may have underestimated the effort needed. As well, as its effects on the rest of my life.</p>

     <p>Like Cobra Kai, the life cycle of talking about Really Simple Syndication feeds never dies. Since reaching 2.0 thanks to the development group that included Aaron Swartz, RSS has become one of the backbones of the internet. Web silos can try all they like to shut it down and control everything, but it continues to deliver everything from your favourite podcasts to the best websites directly to your proverbial door.</p>
<p>Despite being a massive proponent of RSS, I have been fighting with it for a while. Using other services seemingly built on top of it to suite me better, but nothing beats simply subscribing to your favourite feeds in a simple app of your choice. I am back to doing exactly that because of issues, bugs and perhaps web silos – I simply can’t find anything better.</p>
<p>Listen. Matter has given it a good go and <a href="/2022/12/14/matter-my-most.html">I thoroughly enjoy using it</a>. So much so that I paid for a <a href="/2023/05/15/received-some-gifts.html">Patron subscription</a>, including three years of access and priority support. Building several shortcuts and reading workflows to share highlights to my blog and annotate interesting articles. Since before <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/nucleus">their own 2.0 version</a>, I’ve been using it to subscribe to much of the web through RSS and delivering newsletters to it. However, it just doesn’t cut it any more.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9fa45b5b0e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>See the screenshots above, I am subscribed to <a href="https://birchtree.me">Matt Birchler’s blog</a> feed in both Matter and Reeder 5. These should be the same, yet there’s a stark difference with what is available for me to read. Despite flagging feeds all the time because I know there are posts missing, nothing ever changes. I realise that Matter does numerous fancy things by parsing all the web content etc, but this is more of a realisation that regular old RSS is best.</p>
<p>In a search to find a replacement, I went on a tour of all the services I could find or came recommended. Many built on top of RSS. Some offered seemingly extortionate ‘Pro’ subscriptions for finding new RSS feeds for you (yet only sticking to well-known websites). Even more of them offered me some kind of assistant to summarise the articles for me. Among all the investigation, I discovered something different – like my note-taking, <a href="/2023/03/03/the-simplest-path.html">the simplest path</a> is the best.</p>
<p>If you want to build some fancy second brain and map your thoughts, or write notes until your fingers are numb, there’s a service out there for you. Yet, the two decade old idea of just subscribing to the RSS feed is often the way to go.</p>

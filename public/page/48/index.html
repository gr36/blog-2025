     <p>I’ve struggled with my motivation and inspiration in photography for years. It’s been something I am always interested in, yet limited by the time and attention I can give it. I felt as if living in a sleepy (boring) town was difficult to take the pictures I wanted to take.</p>
<p>These feelings are ultimately driven by external forces. Looking at others that take amazing photos and live in cool places. It was easy to blame other things instead of improve my abilities.</p>
<p>So I decided to challenge myself to look at things differently. Pick somewhere and take different photos of it and look for things no one else had taken. My first stop was a local sculpture that I had taken one of my favourite shots of all time at. I aimed for 10 and got quite a few different images that I am happy with</p>

     <p>I always struggle to start writing a blog post, so I will just get right to it. There’s no more podcasts coming. I have taken it as far as I can with the time and energy I have available I’m afraid. So with a heavy heart it’s time to say good bye.</p><p>That’s not to say I haven’t enjoyed doing it, and this time around the guests have been fantastic and the conversations even better. The fact is I would just rather be doing other things with my time, and when things feel like a drag it's time for them to go.</p><p>The roughly one hour show I release every other week, takes around 2 hours to record. A further 3-4 to edit and then with time and evergy needed to book guests and do everything else, the time has come to sunset <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/">And You Are</a>.</p><p>My main passion presently is photography, and I am enjoying developing my skills and spending time with my camera in my hand. Combine this with my work and family life, as well as other things I enjoy doing, there just isn’t space in my life to continue.</p><p>I hope you have enjoyed the sporadic seasons as much as I have, and have been introduced to some new people to follow. I will be releasing a few episodes from the archive over the next few weeks, so they are all available, and then I will need to figure out a way to host them permanently without costing me a fortune.</p><p>As much as I am sad to see things end, this feels like the right thing to do at the moment. Well, you never know what the future holds I guess, but for now, this is the end of the road.</p><p>See Ya.</p>

As I adjust to using the iPhone Mini I’ll blog more I think, I just didn’t realise how much I did actually do from my mobile.</blockquote><p>I’m not one for reading something and writing a post straight off the bat, but this one did speak to me quite a bit. I too, struggle with consistency. My blogging comes in peaks and troughs. I used to beat myself up about this, but the reality is, it really doesn’t matter.</p><p>Blogging doesn’t need to be done a certain way, or at a certain rate, unless there is some outside stress that you need to consider. Unless you live from the page views, or get paid for the posts themselves, it doesn’t matter. Publish once a day/week/month/year it doesn’t matter, because you did it when you wanted to do it.</p><p>This is nothing against Lee, nor Jeff, they both write excellent things, and you should check them both out, but it's more to say that pushing isn’t always the way. If you’re doing something for the love of it, then make sure that love is always at the heart of it.</p><p>I’ve fallen down this trap before, and as great as publishing every day is, it’s a strain for no benefit. The same can be said for my photography on Instagram, when I started out, I felt like I had to post every day and grind out posts to get the followers. This just means I fall out of love with things.</p><p>It is interesting to think about the rate that things can change when circumstances do. I write mostly from my Mac, and have never really got in to it from my phone, but it is great to see that such excellent things can be done from their phone. I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-dont-need-a-blog/">love my blog</a>, and I could never not publish to it, but I will do it when I want to because I love it so much I never want to forget that love.</p>

     <p>My life is busy. Between work things, hospital appointments for my daughter and all the other things that life brings, myself and my family live out of our shared calendar. Don’t get me wrong, I get a lot of stuff done, yet I’ve never <em>really</em> nailed down <em>a process</em> that ensures I stay productive — well now is the time.</p><p>Inspiration for this kick in the ass comes from Matt D’Avella and his fascinating video on <a href="https://youtu.be/TSrFtCgV-RA">Bullet Journaling</a>. Instead of preaching the benefits of it and showing off the ridiculous artwork in his, like every other video on YouTuber, he actually <em>did</em> the practice and talked about the issues and covered the improvements it could make. So of course, me Googling bullet journals starts at least halfway through the video until I realise that’s just not going to work.</p><p>The reality is I have tried this before and although it starts well, and I spend a lot of time and money setting it up, the act of writing things down and remembering to check them doesn’t fit for me. That’s not to say it wouldn’t for everyone. Clearly there is a following out there, just take a look at the hundreds of videos made on the subject and the number of places that will sell you accessories to go with it. Manually doing something relies on me having a notebook with me all the time, and that’s never going to happen.</p><p><a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-cant-go/">Unfortunately</a>, I do carry around my phone with me near constantly, or at least have <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-ultimate-minimalist-phone/">my watch on my wrist</a>, so I need to lean on the tools I have. Digital means to get things done are everywhere, and it's important to not get <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-new-productivity/">distracted by shiny new things</a> and spend more time setting things up then getting things done. Taking <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/kia-kamgar/">inspiration from Kia</a>, I have made an internal agreement to only use apps I have already, particularly stock ones, or services that I already rely on and will not increase my expenditure.</p><p>This might take some time.</p>

     <p>The cursor blinks at me in a, what I interpret as, passive-aggressive way. Its yellow line set starkly against the black screen. Gently appearing and reappearing in the same place as if to utter to me that it hasn’t moved. I still haven’t typed anything, instead sat staring at my tormentor. <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/sitting-in-the/">Sitting in the chair</a>, but still unable to conjure up anything to fill this space.</p><p>Sounds easy when you say it out loud. Writing things, blog posts or instruction manuals or web copy. It’s the doing it that’s the hard bit. When you have a vocabulary as small as mine, you’ve perhaps typed out every word you know hundreds of times and now is <strong>the point</strong> where you wonder what is.</p><p>This might as well be dark magic I’m trying to use. I am <em>trying</em> to make something from nothing, but this is a blog post and not a demon to engulf the world. It shouldn’t be this hard.</p><p>Every skill is, though. You have to work at the things you want to do. Especially when you’re as poor at it as I, yet still kind of want to be a writer. Even more so than a fighter pilot I really wanted to be in year 5. Turns out my eyesight is about as good as my grammar, so I am screwed in both counts, but I digress.</p><p>Fuck you line. I’m going to type something now and prove you wrong. Opening up my writing app does work, and I can publish something. The words can be decided upon and put in some semblance of order. I can do this, it just takes time and effort to put the wheels in motion.</p><p>If I’m honest, writing would be a bit boring if it was easy. Yet, anyone can do it with a bit of effort and a mind that wonders. Even me.</p>

     <p>On my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/unplugging-should-be-mandatory/">few days unplugging,</a> I noticed something strange happening. The sun was shining, the atmosphere was upbeat due to most of us having 4 days off work, yet as I looked around the campsite it was filled with people sat feet apart but looking glumly into their phone screen.</p><p>There was social interaction going on, but much of it was circling the phone screen. Sharing funny things they have found, or talking about doing a particular thing they had seen online. The internet is the social hub that controls almost all the interaction here.</p><p>Each person was more than able to gain the feedback and entertainment they needed, in person. Yet almost all appeared focused elsewhere entirely. As Richard Seymour outlined in the Twittering machine perfectly, all the of the people around me were using their smartphone to take them away without leaving. “It is as though we are both lonely and threatened by intimacy”.</p><p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07YM4N89C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">this book</a> – with all its nihilistic approach to social media – outlines a lot of what I observed, but did not make this site less of an eye-opener. “The Twittering Machine promises to give us access to everything, limitlessly, allowing us to transcend the limitations of mere flesh”. Of course, this behaviour is defended by those that have swallowed the marketing.</p><p>The truth is, we have been sold this idea that by being always connected and entertained, we are being more social. Facebook promises to “<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/">bring people closer together</a>” yet our society couldn’t be more apart than any time in human history. The tale that social media connects us together is a lie, and instead we are left with people that value connectivity over the internet more than with the people around them.</p><p>Scoring internet points and sharing memes is not social. Talking, interacting and engaging is. These things <em>can</em> happen over the internet, I have some great group chats and social media interactions that provide this, but none of this is facilitated by the companies. What they really want is for users to feed it so full of data that it can sell you things. Becoming so big that people feel at a detriment for not being part of the fake conversation.</p><p>Those that do not want to adopt these modern tropes feel obliged to explain themselves to others. Feeling judged and looked down on because they do not conform. Made a social outcast by the very people they are trying to interact with on a personal level. It seems apt that many conspiracy theorists refer to those that believe the prevailing narrative as sheep, when the reverse is true to those that will not swallow the social media lie.</p><p>There is no social in social media if it takes us away from the world around us. If we sit in huddles with others and stare at our phones, in any of this.</p>

     <p>For the last few months, I have been trying to work out why I can’t be bothered with tech any more. I have felt these feeling before, but always come around again when something happens, or I just come out of the rut. Don’t get me wrong. I have long given up writing about it in any great details, I leave that to people better at it than I, but this time is different – I just can’t be bothered with it at all.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I still read about it and keep slightly up to date with news, but most of it is just met with a shrug. Thankfully, I worked out my feelings while reading <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/how-dall-e-could-power-a-creative">Platformer</a> this morning, and I think it’s because the wonderment has gone.</p><blockquote>What makes these moments stand out, I think, is the sense that some unpredictable set of new possibilities had been unlocked. — Casey Newton</blockquote><p>There are a few things in my life I still look back on that created these feelings of amazement. The “oh shit” moments that technology improvement split my life into a before and after section. The first time I logged into Yahoo chat and the person I spoke to was from the USA, the first time I downloaded a song from the internet instead of needing a tape. Google Assistant speaking the answer to a question straight back to me, or filling my room with sound from one Sonos speaker.</p><p>The list could go on and on, but all of these things seem very far behind me. Where have my “Oh shit” moments gone, and what could create them going forward? In the post above, Casey talks about AI providing the next line in the sand that we will all remember. The moment where the world changed forever, and you look back on to remember where you were when it all changed.</p><p>Perhaps Casey’s right, it could be a long way off, but Ai advancements will provide a real change to the way the world works. What won't provide it is Apple putting widgets on my lock screen, or being able to shoot a photo at 3x instead of 2x. My world of tech has slowed, and it is perhaps no longer about world-changing moments and instead slow progress forward which can mostly be ignored.</p>

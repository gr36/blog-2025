<blockquote><p>
  The problem with insular bubbles isn’t just that you’re surrounded by people that share the same world view. It’s also terribly problematic that every time an opposing viewpoint pokes through, it’s re-told and framed through the lens of someone that already disagrees with it.<br />
  You can’t expect to understand the argument unless you actually listen to someone that believes it whole-heartedly.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not sure what provoked Mike’s post, but it could be about any number of things in recent times. Living in a bubble feels amazingly great, you’re rewarded for feeling the same as everyone else and protected by people that feel the same as you. It’s <a href="https://gr36.com/addicted-to-conspiracy-theories/">simple biology that may be hardwired</a> to enable us to find safe communities.</p>
<p>As pointed out above, this is dangerous for balanced thought and just general understanding of other people. Building a tolerance to other threads of thought is impossible to achieve when you are not even interested in the other side of the coin.</p>
<p>But why should we? AI and algorithms understand us better than other people, so we are quite contented living in our little bubble and have content surfaced for us to hit that little dopamine bubble. When someone crosses our path that has different beliefs than our own, why should we tolerate it?</p>
<p>To be a better human that’s why!</p>

     <p>It was so nice today to receive a text out the blue just asking if I was ok. It isn’t something I get very often, if at all, but to come from someone I ‘met on the web’ it meant so much more. With my wife suffering from COVID, one child to home school and another that needs constant care, as well as working full time from home, the pressures are starting to show.</p><p>I don’t have many ‘real’ friends as my wife would put it, because to be honest I don’t really have much spare time, and even less for the last year. However, I have met some really awesome people through social media, and specifically Twitter that I am happy to now call friends.</p><p>It made me think about reaching out to others more often. I’ve done it myself just recently and I really hope it has had the same effect on them, that the message I received today had on me. For something so small, it meant so much and gave me a real boost today as things get tough around here. Social media can often display a life that is nothing like the one actually being experienced, and mental health issues can strike anyone, at any time.</p><p>My renewed motivation has led me to setting a reminder for me to reach out to someone new each week and just catch up with them. I am hoping this small gesture will make sure we are all getting through the bad times and are able to reach the good times. I urge you all to do the same, reach out to a loved one, friend, colleague or neighbour and just check in. A brief message just saying you are thinking of them can mean the world in challenging times.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  The impulse for classification is a staple of internet life—tag yourself; add your interests; pick your favourite croissant, and we’ll tell you the Taylor Swift song that sums up your life.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I had no idea what on earth cottage core was when I clicked on this. Turns out it’s yet another way for people to get attention online.</p>
<p>But this statement really stuck out to me. Classifying yourself as something seems to be so important to people, and even fleeting trends on social media seem to need a name.</p>
<p>This label thing seems to be huge in tech. “I’m and Apple guy”. “I’m a manga nerd”. “You’re an Android user”. The need to exist in a group runs deep into our core (see what I did there) and we cling to labels in almost everything we do.</p>
<p>When thinking about who you are, it’s important to know these things and recognise their importance in your life — but don’t make labels important to your existence.</p>

     <p>After my failed attempt to run a blog membership I was disillusioned with trying to monetise my creative things. Annoyed that although a few people contributed, it didn’t do anywhere near the level that I expected and really knocked my confidence.</p><p>Truth is, I have been trying for a while to make writing and blogging pay like it used to. 6-7 years ago web ads paid ok with a few thousand hits a month and didn’t completely wreck your website and income paid for my hosting and even allowed me to, shock horror, make a little profit.</p><p>The web is much different now than even that brief time ago. The level of content available online for free is ridiculously high. With little searching you can find software, services, videos, and even news coverage for free. At least in the sense that it appears to be free, admittedly some apps, service etc do show ads. Which makes it much harder, without a very dedicated audience to charge for anything.</p><p>So what’s the solution — if there even is an issue at all? I asked, I gave many hours to the cause and like many of us, hit a wall. I could stop doing what I am doing, which isn’t likely (I talked about this in a recent edition of my newsletter) given my very low bar of what success looks like. But it would be easy for me to do so. I feel that jealous rage when someone does things better than me that we all do at some points. It’s dead easy to just throw in the towel and admit defeat.</p><p>It’s not defeat though. It’s the same result that thousands of bloggers feel. Those that make typos like I do, rush like I do, and write about things that have a huge talent pool. The elite group is a tiny little percentage that start out, especially in tech, and I don’t even want to <em>have</em> to write about tech all day every day anyway. It would just kill off my love of anything!</p><p>I asked, I’m giving, and I am still blogging — now more than ever.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I am not going to lie, 2020 was tough — as it was for loads of people, some more so than me. The pandemic hit at a time I was finally moving towards the goals I have worked for for a long time. Then <a href="/2021/02/04/124258.html">this happened</a>, that happened, blah blah blah woe is me right.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>I’m looking up. And forward to the time that things will be easier, quieter and a whole lot more social. There will be a time when I don’t have to <a href="/2020/08/20/missing-a-good.html">miss people as much as I do</a>. I don’t have to worry after every cough that I’ve caught something, and a time when I can do things on days off. However, I absolutely refuse to go back to the way things were and I hope you are too.</p>
<blockquote><p>Choosing to Return to the way things were is like choosing not to adopt software a decade or two ago. It’s an option, but one that will doom a company to mediocrity. (Packy McCormick, <a href="https://notboring.substack.com/p/were-never-going-back">We’re Never Going Back</a></p></blockquote>
<p>We are not The nEw NoRmaL but the hope I look up to is that we become something different than before. That I become something different. Working, Social and everything in-between is improved to a point where it improves lives and we are more community orientated. We look out for each other and build a community around it that cares for us in our times of need and is built of real relationships.</p>
<p>Not likes, not retweets, not clicks not views. Nothing that can be measurable and compatible. Something that is a lot more real, almost tangible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have no idea what that is, but I don’t trust the <a href="https://gr36.com/social-media-2021/">current crop of web platforms</a> to care about anything other than metrics and growth. We are the ones that need to c<a href="/2021/01/11/social-media-in.html">are about each other more</a>. We are the users that provide platforms with content and drive the growth they crave. The ones that hold the power to change our own communities for the good.</p>
<p>We can’t rely on anyone but ourselves to look forward, look around and change the things we are not happy with. It could be working conditions in our company, it could be needing more support from friends, it could be focusing yourself in different areas. It doesn’t matter what it is, look forward.</p>
<p>We simply don’t deserve to just slip back to the way thing were.</p>

<p>What are you trying to achieve? What change do you want to make to attendees actions or mindset? Because if there isn’t a clear message then we are just going to watch slides full of information we could of read on an email.</p>
<p>It’s a business cliche that half the meetings should be emails, yet the meeting and pointless decks keep coming. I follow a few simple rules to clean my diary of guff.</p>
<ol>
<li>No agenda = no meeting</li>
<li>No possible solutions outlined = no meeting</li>
<li>A way to solve this with a meeting = no meeting.</li>
</ol>

  Sometimes we can get so caught in our ways of thinking, we become blind to what is right in front of us. One way around that is to adopt the opposite idea for a while. This could be a big idea (like a world view) or something small (like “wide angle lenses are the best for street photography”).</p>
<p>  When you adopt the opposite view, you may confirm your traditional belief or approach. But you may also notice something different, something unexpected. Sometimes it’s a small thing (isolating a subject can lead to great effects in street photography) and sometimes its revolutionary.

<p>Dare I admit this, but I have a habit of, as my Grandad would say, <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cant-see-the-wood-for-the-trees">not seeing the wood for the trees</a>. I often get bogged down in minute details that are incorrect but miss the larger meaning or intent of the opposing view.</p>
<p>In my defense some of my closest friends, including my wife, often have opposing view points I enjoy nothing more than trying to see where they are coming from and use this to better my own understanding. However, it’s always good to be reminded of our ability to adopt the other position, because sit quite often leads to great results.</p>

     <p>Whenever an idea hits me, or I just want to ‘say’ something to the internet I press the little blue box with the bird on it. That is just what I’ve <em>always</em> done, well for the last 12 years anyway, and that habit is proving almost impossible to break. If thoughts arise, they are flung onto the internet in the quickest possible time!</p>
<p>This isn’t restricted to the mobile app either. In fact, I haven’t had it installed for weeks, but I can open Safari, and be browsing through Twitter before I even register what is going on. Every spare moment when I could be bored, my hand instinctively reaches for my phone. I don’t even think it has anything to do with the service, it is simply a behavioral habit that is almost impossible for me to break. The muscle memory of years of usage is so powerful that I can’t switch it off without expending <em>a lot</em> of energy.</p>
<img src="uploads/2024/6e75110cba.jpg" />
<p>There are two options really, I could start jumping up and down, blaming Twitter and cursing designers. Without a doubt that does play a part, but as I have talked about before I don’t <a href="/2020/09/09/itxs-not-the.html">blame the internet for my issues</a>, I lay them at my feet. My other option, the path I am choosing, is to recognize these traits and slowly break them without giving myself a bad time. Where I would usually feel down, buy a smaller phone or some other radical move, I do something else or write a blog post just like this one!</p>
<p>I do want my <a href="/2020/09/01/the-trickle-down.html">attention back</a> from these types of actions, I don’t want behaviors like this to be so ingrained I can’t help it. However, the muscle memory runs so deep I may never be able to fix it completely. There is nothing wrong with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_time">dead time</a> if used correctly and being busy helps quite a bit. As I have learned, there is no one more hash on me than myself, but things like this drive me more than a little mad.</p>

  It involves the use of simple, well-bounded scenes of flat cartoon figures in action, often with a slight distortion in proportions (the most common of which being long, bendy arms) to signal that a company is fun and creative. Corporate Memphis is inoffensive and easy to pull off, and while its roots remain in tech marketing and user interface design, the trend has started to consume the visual world at large. It’s also drawing intense criticisms from those within the design world.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I quite enjoy it when opinionated designers loose their cool. It makes them seem more human and not on the pedestal they often put themselves on. But on this occasion I do somewhat understand the annoyance, but they fail to communicate it very well.</p>
<p>Dubbed Corporate Memphis, we’ve see this coming for a long time. Todoist <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/178">introduced the tiny heads illustrations</a> that seemed to leak into every other app and now the same style is everywhere. Brands are loosing their uniqueness out of laziness more than anything.</p>
<p>There is a high level of pattern matching going on, but that doesn’t mean you can’t turn this style to display your brand. As someone that uses this style a little it has made some of our more information dense work more approachable by displaying images that customer are used to seeing, and I am certainly not put off using it because other designers get a bit snooty about it.</p>
<p>Using this style indeed makes the barrier to entry of designing something professional much smaller, and as with photographers, that tends to hurt creatives a little. Yet I can understand the argument at least a little.</p>

  some of the people I unfollowed are genuine friends of mine. But I’ve sort-of reached a breaking point. I was becoming more and more miserable with each passing day and my Twitter timeline — a place that used to be filled with links to neat applications, interesting gadgets, and positive ideas — was filled with political stories that just made me unhappy.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I know this feeling well. Some of the people I have unfollowed is simply because of the way some of their posts make me feel. I have moved quite a few people to lists and just checking in on them every so often. I’ve also opted to send the odd email to people instead of replying to their tweet, or move it to somewhere I am more comfortable to reply.</p>
<p>This is a huge problem with <a href="https://gr36.com/social-media-2021/">social media and its catch all approach</a>, I deeply care for some of the people I used to follow on Social Media but I need to be distanced from the noise.</p>
<p>One thing that has taught me though is the people that reach out <strong>to you</strong> are the ones that are really worth following.</p>

      <p>Raheem Stirling speaking to Wired about the <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/mental-strength/a38170363/raheem-sterling-headspace-ambassador/">benefits of meditation</a>:</p><blockquote>It’s only now that I can see the benefits of such a practice on people of all ages and I’m really looking forward to the difference we can make together in developing the conversation around mental health, educating on tools and resources that can help people manage everyday challenges.</blockquote><p>I wrote a while ago about the strange response you get from <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/meditation-has-a-pr-problem/">suggesting meditation</a> to others. The perception of meditation is still very varied. Although now more than ever people seem open to trying new practices to improve their mental health, meditation is still a bit woo woo for most.</p><p>Heaven forbid you utter the word mindfulness. Marketing companies seem to have ruined this word for anyone to use, carrying with it all kinds of hippie visions.</p><p>Anything that brings this wonderful practice to more people, and allows others to see the benefits to almost everything in their life is a benefit. I am excited to see where this goes.</p>

      <p>I am a simple soul that falls for far too many marketing ploys. Companies don’t even have to put much effort in, either. I listen to people on the internet far more than I should do. It only takes a <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/josh-ginters-ulysses-setup-and-workflow/">post like this</a> by Josh Gunter <a href="https://twitter.com/gr36/status/1456809562561028099?s=21">for me to clean</a> up my Ulysses set up and dive back into it again.</p><p>This could be the fourth or fifth time I have returned to using Ulysses. I’m never quite sure why I stop, I just get destructed by the new hottest thing and have my head turned. I try <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/my-obsidian-set/">almost every new thing</a> because, as Josh says in the opening live of his Ulysses <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/josh-ginters-ulysses-setup-and-workflow/">set up post</a>, “I have these on-again, off-again relationships with certain types of apps”. Although he doesn’t with writing apps, these and task managers are my weakness — but <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/looking-for-my/">after last time</a> I really should have learnt my lesson.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/2769ef5d64.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>Enough self deprivation, let’s move on. I found the idea of a kanban set up of-sorts inside Ulysses interesting. Although my usual use of an inbox and folders for deferent types of post weren’t a million miles away, this is another step towards regular posting. For me, it’s all about getting things down on paper, at least digitally. It’s easy to forget ideas, or lose them in another notes app, but storing everything in an inbox or ideas folder should help me write more. It also won’t hurt to allow me to delete a few once the idea has settled a little!</p><p>By moving things down the question a little, I am already writing a bit more when I have a few moments, or checking over posts that I need to edit. Filling a few moments with writing or jotting down notes rather than anything else. Storing ideas and links for posts is also easy with Shortcuts integrations with Ulysses, I may share this Shortcut once I have settled on a set-up I am happy with. You never quite know with me, I might be on to the next thing pretty soon, but this setup should push me to publish more. Please <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/josh-ginters-ulysses-setup-and-workflow/">check it out for yourself</a> and see if this setup could improve your workflow to.</p>

      <p>In all the time sucking manipulative apps I have ever installed on my phone, Instagram gets me every time. The Facebook affect has turned my once beloved app into a cesspool of attention-seeking posts that use all the UI tricks in the book to hook me in. It gets me every time. There are too many good things about it to stop using my account completely, so imagine my surprise when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-desktop-web-post-creation-and-collabs-150032945.html">posting from the web</a> became available.</p><p>As part of quite a few updates to the way Instagram works that are happening at the moment, Meta have launched web posting after announcing the upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550010/instagram-post-from-desktop-web-browser-testing">feature in January</a>. It’s a welcome feature to. Everyone who uses a camera knows the slight annoyance of editing your image in Lightroom after importing from an SD card. Only then having to save to Photos or send it to your phone to post to Instagram. Sure, it’s a first world problem, but it always felt like one that could be fixed. Instagram has a web interface, yet chose to close off parts of the experience to only mobile users — no doubt all in the pursuit of growth.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/e3df2518f1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>As much as I love <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/refill-my-glass/">using Glass</a> there are far more people on Instagram and I find more posts of awesome pictures for me to look at. So sucking me straight in and wasting my time doesn’t take much doing, especially with all the wonderful autumn colours in new images being posted. Thankfully, I am awe of this and try to limit my usage or not have the app installed unless I want to post. It feels like this update is for people like me to solve the two issues pointed out above but still get usage.</p><p>It’s not perfect. There are still a few features missing from the web experience, such as editing previously posted images, but it’s a gigantic improvement. Along with recently going back to <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1455947657067782148?s=21">allowing image previews on Twitter</a> it’s great to see the service improving. If they could just get rid of the shopping tab and actually get interested in me adding photos again, that would be great!</p>

      <p>I know what you're thinking…. again! This time I haven't fallen out with myself and moved just because someone else <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/migrating-from-wordpress/">told me how good their blogging platform is</a>. Or decided that I want to try to quit something yet again. This time it's a little more important because I have got my hands on a new domain and wanted to build something to last.</p><p>After years of trying, literally the first time I tried was 2014, I have managed to purchase gregmorris.co.uk. It took a while of going backwards and forwards with domain buyers, but here we are. Now that I have a domain that reflects me a little better, I wanted a website that reflects what I am up to. It didn’t seem right just porting my <a href="https://gr36.com/">scruffy WordPress blog</a> and I have been lusting after something more portfolio based for a long time.</p><p>My first thoughts were to implement my photography into my blog posts here on Ghost, but I annoy enough people with the range of things I post about that I didn’t want to worsen it with my photos too. So I built this.</p><p>It isn’t all my work. The theme started off as <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Edge">Edge</a>, a photography-based theme that is official and free. The theme looks lovely, but I dusted off my skills and made a blog page to go with it that is brand new. I also tidied up the CCS, made things my own and implemented a dark mode (your eyes will thank me). I’ve worked really hard on it, hence <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1456334349880680459?s=20">the radio silence for a while</a> and dedicated a lot of my time to learning many new skills. Likewise, I keep expecting things to break, but they seem OK at the moment as long as I don’t <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/i-need-to/">keep playing with it</a>.</p><h2 id="what-about-gr36">What about GR36?</h2><p>Nothing will happen with that domain for a while. All of my posts have moved over, but redirecting all the historical traffic I get will take some time for me to work out how to do it best. I will more than likely keep the domain around for the foreseeable, and do something with it once I am happy that everything is done correctly. I am a little sad that after more than a decade blogging <a href="http://gr36.com/">gr36.com</a> might die off, but I am excited that my website better reflects my interests.</p><p>For the next few weeks, expect internal links to be a little broken on my new website as I update everything. I kept all the permanent link structure the same, but there is no avoiding a complete domain change. I have a new <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/rss/">RSS feed</a> which I may point the GR36 one at shortly.</p><p>I would love to know your feedback and opinions on anything I should change, privately if possible.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>At their October event Apple unveiled <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2021/10/apple-unveils-game-changing-macbook-pro/">huge improvements</a> to the ‘pro’ line up of laptops. Moving the whole line over to their own silicone, adding in <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/making-bets-on-the-future-is-risky/">more ports</a> and silently whispering an apology. Despite more than 5 years meddling with them, adding in needless features as well overcomplicating and compromising their laptops — they are done with meddling with keyboards. How long this will last, who knows, but the simple (all be it silent) admission that can be read between the lines, is that they were wrong in almost all areas. The constant march towards thinner and thinner devices simply does not work with laptops.</p><p>In order to slim down their laptop line in the last few years Apple, understandably, made quite a few decisions that were at detriment to its users. Battery life suffered. Connectivity needed by many of its users was removed and replaced by dongles, but most damaging was the compromise to the working of the laptop. The butterfly keyboard is perhaps one of the most damming decisions Apple has ever made about its computers. I was one of the lucky ones that wasn’t affected at all through my usage of them, yet still queued up to pick up my 2020 version once they returned to more traditional scissor switches.</p><p>As someone that types out thousands of words a day, I do have some opinions on these keyboards but this post isn’t really about them. It’s more about the way companies view the keyboards themselves. They have improved slightly over the years, but remained pretty mush as they were decades ago. A bit like the mouse, you can mess around with some things, add in buttons or make using it easier to use, but you cant change the way they work. The touch points are the most important area of a computer, and like handle bars on a bike, need to feel good and work well.</p><p>Who knows if Apple saw the future of typing on their computers as being as close to glass as possible, but that’s not a future I want to be a part of. The butterfly keyboards I used were fine, you get used to them in the end (unless yours breaks) but as soon as you return to something using scissor switches you realise who bad they are. Nothing beats good key travel and a nice tactile feel — there are whole industries built around it worth <a href="https://www.knowledge-sourcing.com/report/global-mechanical-keyboard-market">more than $1billion</a>.</p><p>I can forgive the Touchbar (also now removed) as a gimmick that Apple thought would become more useful. It didn’t hurt the keyboard, apart from needing more concentration to use than it should do, but messing around with the keyboard itself gets much more of a reaction. The company is now aware that is customers like <a href="https://screenrant.com/apple-2021-macbook-pro-no-touch-bar-why/">full-Sized, tactile keys</a> but I am not sure why it took 5 years to work it out. Perhaps now they will stop messing around with the keyboard and continue to build thicker, more capable laptops that have what their customers need.</p>

      <p>Casey Newton on <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/facebook-goes-meta">Facebook going Meta</a>:</p><blockquote>It struck me, given the recent conversation around how old and out of touch Facebook has been lately, how strong the Boomer vibes were coming from those reacting to Thursday’s presentation. A surprising number of people seem to think that technological progress ended with the smartphone, and that augmented reality, virtual reality, and connected experiences between platforms will never come to pass.</blockquote><p>I’m not into all opinions that seems a little bit like an old man shaking his fist at the sky being labelled ‘boomer’ but I completely understand where Casey is coming from here.</p><p>I don’t think there is anyone of the opinion that technological advancements stopped at the smartphone but if you are of a certain age the prospect of VR/AR being “the future” has been spouted for decades and is still not here. So it may seem to some that land never seems to appear over the horizon.</p><p>All through the 80’s and 90’s VR was promised and hinted at through all sorts of media. Movies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lawnmower_Man_(film)">the Lawnmower Man</a>, and video games systems such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Boy">Virtual Boy</a> seemed to be the vanguard of a new era — only for the noise to die out for another couple of decades. We’ve also been searching for the next thing after mobile for years, so I think we can excuse the dismissive tendencies even without whoever is trying to build these things.</p>

      <p>I go backwards and forwards about what I want <a href="http://gr36.com/">gr36.com</a> to be. Over the years it has been a portfolio of sorts, an attempt at being a news website, a podcast host and lots of things in between. Nowadays it’s decidedly more amateur and more of an extension of myself that evolves over time depending on what I am up to and an extension of myself.</p><p>I don’t even have a ‘thing’ I want to write about. Most people seem to have an issue, or a cause, or even an interest they want to cover all the ins and outs of. I loosely revolve around technology but expand into all sorts of areas that I am interested in, but I guess thats the point a personal blog should be an extension of the person hitting the publish button.</p><p>Everything that my blog is I have learnt to do. I have studied zero computing skills officially, but my blog as taught me HTML and CSS skills along with some serve management things, SEO knowledge and a vast number of things — many of which I have already forgotten. The current WordPress is self-hosted, when it was <a href="http://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a> I had to learn all the Hugo things that made it tick. As such, in times of hardship when I wonder why bother I remember that my blog is more than words, it is a place I have grown.</p><blockquote>But most importantly, I want to be able to be wrong. I want to change my mind! I want to evolve. . . .blogging feels to me like a world of endless drafting, endless revisioning. – <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2021/02/09/blogging-as-a-forgiving-medium/">Austin Kleon</a></blockquote><p>I have written a great many words, most of them terrible, but most of which have taught me something about myself just through the act of typing them out. I have changed my mind, worked thing through and changed as a person because I have written them on the internet. I want to be held accountable for the words that come from me and a blog is the best place to do it. As Austin write about above, it’s more forgiving than putting all of your thoughts on social media. You are allowed to get things wrong. Be forgiven for the occasional (or more than occasional) spelling mistake or typo because a blog is you.</p><p>Much like the post on a blog, that you can edit, improve, and grow them they reflect the thoughts that spurred them in the first place. Austin Kleon also goes on to point out the importance of getting things wrong later in his post he says “Being wrong publicly is the easiest way to learn what you need to know.” This applies to a friend texting you to say that the MacBook Pro 13″ has <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/dont-buy-the-m1-macbook-pro/">two ports and not four,</a> but also to opinions you have on anything. I can get things wrong in person, or on social media, but there is nothing quite like writing a post and growing because I wrote it.</p><p>The design is a bit weird; the words are hit and miss but it’s my blog, and it’s personal.</p><p>Edit: Not long after this <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/a-new-home/">I found a new home</a></p>

      <p>As much as <a href="https://gr36.com/2020/10/30/of-my-favourite/">I love 1Password</a>, I don’t love having to pay yet another subscription. So when Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529266/passkeys-icloud-keychain-ios-15-passwordless-future-security-login">overhauled their password manager</a> I was intrigued to try it out as fast as possible. Sure, using a fully integrated system probably isn’t the safest way to do things, but given 1Passwords <a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-the-story-so-far/">move away from OS specific apps</a> these improvements could be exactly what I needed.</p><p>At first look it works well enough to get most people going. Improving the security of average users accounts by suggesting much stronger passwords. The recent improvements also allows users to add in one time passwords, otherwise referred to as two factor authentication codes. Without doubt it is leading users down a path to making sure their accounts are much more secure and anything that allows you to do this without any technical knowledge is a good move. Even if it is perhaps not the <em><em>very</em></em> best practice to follow it is better than no password manager at all.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="uploads/2024/6e6fba244e.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1302" /></figure><p>With that said, entry of passwords is not always the easiest when compared to other options. Providing the website or app is developed correctly you can put in usernames, passwords and two factor codes with a few taps, but if not it is a pain to go into setting and find them. Well this <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/02578985347f49d7b4f3d95b75e0c062">Shortcut</a> created by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Krokmou/">Reddit user Krokmau</a> enables access on not just iOS but also macOS providing you have the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/macos/monterey/">Monterey update</a> installed allowing access to Shortcuts. Once run it will detect what OS is being used and display the passwords stored in iCloud.</p><p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/02578985347f49d7b4f3d95b75e0c062">Grab it HERE</a></p><p>I have pinned this to my menu bar on my mac as well as put it in the iOS widget on my homescreen so I have easier access than I have ever had before. I am sure Apple will improve things moving forward but perhaps not for another year. So in the mean time this Shortcut will save you loads of time hunting around in settings.</p>

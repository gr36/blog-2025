  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Turns out that I have more smaller thoughts than I thought (try saying that three times fast). Coupled with some nice feedback, has inspired me to publish some more bit sized posts for you to consume.</p>
<h2 id="the-happiness-privilege">The Happiness Privilege</h2>
<p>I’ve just finished <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781529396508">Happy, Sexy, Millionaire</a> by Steven Bartlet. It’s a pretty short book that doesn’t fall into the same trap most books with a similar message do and become a series of cherry-picked anecdotal stories. Near the start he discusses his pursuit of happiness, in that he started out with the wrong outlook and gives one of the most important outlooks that I’ve read for a while.</p>
<p>The premise is to not look for things to make you happy, but look for happiness instead. As he points out, just the sheer contemplation of wanting to change your life to be happy comes from an amazingly privileged place already.</p>
<p>The fact that you can even dare to think about changing things in your life to be more happy should make you stop and think. There is a massive section of the world that this simply isn’t an option, there is no other process than simply doing whatever they need to survive. We are all in an amazingly privileged place just to be reading this text and thinking about happiness, never forget that. You are already enough.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9c8cf84629.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="quiet-apathy">Quiet Apathy</h2>
<p>There’s a general belief that there are only two sides of every argument now. Commentators point to issues like Brexit and vaccinations that the world at large is moving further apart. There’s some truth in this, at least in my anecdotal observations, the world does seem further apart. However, that is because you only hear from both of these extreme sides, and the rest of us don’t care enough.</p>
<p>Take something like the online discourse around the COVID-19 vaccine. Peruse the online world, and you might think you’re either in the camp that got it as soon as possible, or you&rsquo;re an anti-vaxer. The truth is, the vast majority of people were somewhere in the middle. Positive about the advancements, but prefer a bit of a wait and see mentality. We don’t need to be split into camps, but the reality of the online world is that the other side of the argument is always wrong. Quiet apathy is the way to live life happily, have your opinions but don’t give a damn about other people&rsquo;s versions of them. Bliss.</p>
<h2 id="quote-of-the-week">Quote Of The Week</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake up in the day to find it was vanity, but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible - T.E. Lawrence</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="mastodon-for-companies">Mastodon For Companies</h2>
<p>I love the fact that Twitter is burning down. Not for the staff there, I hate that these talented people are without jobs or forced to have one they don’t like. But for the selfish fact it has got me to the stage where my need to visit has diminished, and I feel mush happier about the world.</p>
<p>The only thing I miss is being able to get in touch with brands. Many seem to prioritise support through Twitter and Facebook (neither of which I use) and sending them a tweet for help is easy to do. With this in mind I wondered what would happen if Twitter imploded, or the brand just didn’t want to be there any more, and I ran through a thought experiment where they all had Mastodon instances.</p>
<p>It would be straightforward to toot (I still hate that word) at a brand&rsquo;s customer service if they all become universal. For instance, all customer service could be <code>@cs@webaddress</code>, and you wouldn’t need to root around for anything. Amazon order not shown up, just message <code>@cs@amazon.co.uk</code> or had a bad experience in Tesco, reach out to <code>@cs@tesco.co.uk</code>. This opens up the ability to have those individuals who are representative of the brand, or otherwise want to be open to contact to have the ability, or you just have an internal social network too.</p>
<p>Yes, this relies on everyone understanding Mastodon and there are many that still don’t, but I think it’s a pretty nice idea. Thoughts?</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I was <a href="/2022/11/15/ive-been-working.html">pretty angry</a> this morning. With good reason, I thought at the time. I had lost 4-5 hours worth of work, but it still felt like a pointless emotion. It didn’t get me anywhere, changed absolutely nothing about the situation, and only made me feel worse.</p>
<p>Anger is, in most situations, a pointless emotion to feel. There must be some evolutionary advantages to feeling anger, but in the modern world in generally gets you nowhere. Even in combat, where you would think anger could be advantageous, it just clouds your judgement and increases the chance of mistakes.</p>
<p>Duncan Trussel <a href="https://overcast.fm/+OLq93D16s">put it fantastically</a> when he said that “anger is the second wound inflicted by your enemy”. Something he puts down to Buddha, but unfortunately, I can’t find any reference for it currently. Whoever said it, it is dead on. The only outcome is an wound on the person suffering with it, burnt by its toxic effects.</p>
<p>Anger does not bring back my work. In any situation, it doesn&rsquo;t change whatever has happened, it just affects the future negatively.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I feel as if I start every post about Twitter with the same words. I both love it and hate it, blah blah blah. Well, this time a billionaire baby annoyed me, so I quit for a bit and then decided to set myself a new monthly challenge. I’m 10 days into “No Twitter November” and I have a few observations.</p>
<h2 id="theitch">The Itch</h2>
<p>I’ve known for a long while I’ve had a deep-rooted muscle memory <a href="/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html">Twitter itch</a>. Despite all of my attempts, I can’t stop my unconscious brain from grabbing a device and opening Twitter whenever I am bored. I do it without thinking, and often only catch myself after minutes of doom scrolling.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this has dried up fairly quickly, but I’m not going to lie, the first few days were frustratingly bad. I had to make sure I had signed out everywhere and had no apps installed. The sight of the sign in screen was good enough to jar me back into the real world and stop me from going any further. In the last couple of days it has only happened twice when compared to the first few days occurring a couple of times <em>an hour</em>.</p>
<p>Using Mastodon a bit more has helped / replaced this, so I feel like I am cheating a bit. However, that place doesn’t give me the same hate filled rage and leave me feeling deflated, so it’s a net win.</p>
<h2 id="thelogged-outexperiencesucks">The Logged-Out Experience Sucks</h2>
<p>There are a few newsletters I subscribe to that include some funny tweets, or useful threads to check out. Mostly these show fine, but others require a tap, and if they do, I am usually immediately hit with pop-ups to sign in and “join the conversation”. It sucks that I can’t consume the information logged out, but I expect nothing less.</p>
<p>I debated log and hard if even reading these tweets constituted cheating, but concluded it didn’t. This was further confirmed given the terrible experience if I’m logged out anyway. Every so often you can see what you need to and the screen is taken over if you scroll down, sometimes you’re blocked entirely. It sucks.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/36147889bc.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="75ofmediareliesontwitter">75% Of Media Relies On Twitter</h2>
<p>After a few days of no Twitter, I began to see it everywhere. At first, I put this down to some kind of withdrawal, but it soon became obvious how much of the news sites, personal blogs and YouTube were covering things that happened on or about Twitter.</p>
<p>Granted, this was exaggerated by the baby billionaire doing his best to burn it down. There aren’t many “did you see what happened on Twitter” water cooler moments, but a gigantic percentage of news is about what so-and-so tweeted or other things linked to the service. I now entirely understand why journalists feel like they are chained to checking Twitter. Which leads me to my last point.</p>
<h2 id="imisspeople">I Miss People</h2>
<p>There are a few people who have joined me on my jump from Twitter, but many have not. I miss the interaction I got (no matter how small) from people that I’ve met over the years. Reading their life updates and learning new things they are up to.</p>
<p>Some of this has moved to a group chat, but it doesn’t feel the same. I do miss Twitter when it’s good, and I wish there was some way to make it work, but the longer I spend off the service, the more I realise it is the right thing to do. Perhaps in time I will realise that this space in my brain is better used elsewhere, but presently I miss it. There are a few people that I only interact with on Twitter, so I’ve had to stalk people’s Instagram or find another way to contact them.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I do see myself dipping my toe back in, but perhaps in a much reduced basis. It may take more time to work out the way I am going to gain the little community I had, but I think it can also be built elsewhere too. There’s another 20 days to go, so things might change by then, I’ll let you know.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Since ditching my newsletter a while a go, I haven’t really had a place to share smaller thoughts with the world. It was effortless to fill it full of things that took up some space in my brain and perhaps would make a good talking point, but wasn’t worthy of a blog post. So, I’ve decided to publish them every so often anyway and see how it goes. Welcome to some small thoughts I have had over the last week or so.</p>
<h2 id="systems-and-tools">Systems and tools</h2>
<p>It doesn’t matter what you are trying to do, the system is the most important thing to get right. Look at what you need to achieve and then work backwards in a realistic step process. Once done, the tools you choose will fall around the system. If you don’t get everything straight, you can fall into the trap of letting the tools dictate the system itself. If a tool I use can’t do the job I want it to do, do I then find a different tool or change my system and expectations?</p>
<p>The risk is that changing your tools every time is costly, in both time and money, but if a tool doesn’t fit the system or do what you want it to do, it breaks the system. Working out what you <em>really</em> need to achieve is the only way to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Look at note-taking, for example. Numerous people are told “you need to take notes like this” or “use this app to achieve this specific thing” instead of working out where they must be to make it work. My <a href="/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html">note-taking system</a> was broken for a long time. Not in terms of taking notes, but using the notes later on. Linking between thoughts and surfacing ideas has never worked as well as it thought it should. This made me l<a href="/2022/02/15/link-posts-from.html">ook around constantly</a> for new tools to do this, when in reality when I stopped and thought about it, I never used them anyway.</p>
<p>Is your system broken, or your tools?</p>

<h2 id="different-photos-different-places">Different Photos, Different Places</h2>
<p>I figured something out last week to do with photo services. I post <a href="/2022/10/03/taking-the-shot.html">different photos</a> to different places. Instagram gets a bit more editing and only a few chosen photos. I usually then posted more natural ones to Glass <a href="/2022/08/08/for-the-sake.html">when I used it</a>, and then I am perfectly happy dumping all the rest on my blog / micro.blog.</p>
<p>The different places seem to be set up for different things. I would never dream of posting anything personal to Glass. It feels too much like a pro photographer&rsquo;s place to share the best of the best. Like what Instagram should be without all the gaming and attention seeking that plagues an otherwise great platform.</p>
<p>I sometimes found myself shooting a photo slightly differently, or editing a different version for Instagram. Which often leave me feeling a bit strange. Typically, photos I don’t even like do better on Instagram because they have a similar look and feel to others, but I edit how I like when I post to my blog.</p>

<p>Maybe, I need to make peace with the fact that I cannot keep up. I cannot keep up with the growing list of brilliant books. I cannot keep up with the gifted writers churning beautiful essays.

<h2 id="because-of-instagram">Because Of Instagram</h2>
<p>“The modern world is stupid” says every old man who wants to shake his fist confused. Me included. I don’t get most of the business decisions today, and most of the marketing I see is just bizarre. Which is somewhat worrying because that’s what I’m supposed to know about for my day job. I do understand where most of it has come from, and the influence of Instagram cannot be understated.</p>
<p>There’s a whole world of products and businesses out there built solely because of the instagram effect. They have designed their products, and sometimes entire practices, to appeal to a certain ascetic and sell things to the Instagram (and now TikTok) generation. This isn’t just something that appeals to Gen-Z either. The amount of money that I have spent on experiences and products purely because my wife wants to post to Instagram is more than I care to admit.</p>

<h1 id="an-ode-to-quick-note">An ode to quick note</h1>
<p>It took Apple a while, but they finally made Apple notes truly useful on my iPhone. Yes, there are still things they need to improve, like the terrible implementation of rich text, but quick note is a revelation and the cornerstone of everything I need to capture whilst using my phone.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter where I am, <a href="/2022/08/02/writing-instead-of.html">what I am doing</a>, but within seconds I can take a note. By adding a small icon to control centre, and also allowing me to swipe up on the iPad, I’ve turbocharged my note-taking and also saved myself some money. I no longe rely on an app like Drafts, to make sure I can take a quick note — I love Quick note.</p>

      <p>Although <a href="https://gr36.status.lol/636179534308c">my monthly challenge</a> forbids me from checking Twitter, my reading stream and other social media is full of Twitter news. I honestly couldn’t care less what the business does, and what Elmo turns his attention on to monetise its user base, but most of the chatter seems to be about blue check marks and paying for subscriptions. Weirdly, I’ve been thinking about this for years and have a few thoughts.</p>
<p>The main issue is my confusion around what Verified means on Twitter. The word just seems wrong in the context that Twitter puts on it. Never fitting in to any mental model I can come up with. The way in which it is portrayed certainly needs refreshing if not removing, but the blue check already carries its own weight after years of use.</p>
<p>Verified should mean ‘this person is who they say they are’. In so far as Twitter have carried out some checks, perhaps uploading an ID and placing some code in your website, and as far as they can tell, this person is real. The user is then verified, but it shouldn’t have the importance that Twitter places on it currently.</p>
<p>To Twitter, Verified means that this person is who they say they are, but they represent the way Twitter wants to portray its service. In as much as, if you don’t conform and break some unwritten rules, the first strike for Twitter is often to remove the user&rsquo;s Verified badge. A weird way to work when you can call the service anything you like, yet chose your marker as ‘Verified’.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/de93a8ad23.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="how-i-would-fix-verified">How I Would Fix Verified</h2>
<p>For years, I have wanted a Twitter pro that is worth paying for. Solving the platform&rsquo;s biggest problem and also gaining some income. Whilst I understand that the way Twitter works, fast-paced and with a massive reach, is its USP. Most of the issues users face is due to bots and anonymous users.</p>
<p>I feel users should be able to prove who they say they are and get a blue check mark. You shouldn’t <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-reverses-real-names-policy-apologizes/">be forced to use your name</a> or other downfalls of similar ideas, but Twitter should be able to tell who you are and therefore be answerable for your conduct. As a perk, users can decide to <em>only</em> interact with others that are verified and have robust filtering in place to only see those users. If Twitter wants you to pay, fine, that’s their call, but users need useful features in exchange for money.</p>
<p>Twitter could then extend this towards other markers for people that represent whatever it is that they mark people as Verified currently. Perhaps a gold checkmark, or a deferent thing all together. This still may not resolve the issues currently plaguing it, nor pull me back, but it would perhaps go some way to addressing the current issues.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There’s very little for me to comment on or add value to the conversation around Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/22/apple-announces-more-app-store-ads/">showing adverts</a> on their devices. There are many more knowledgable about the situation than I, and couple with the fact I don’t care currently, means I stay quiet. That said, the recent moaning makes me think back to the days I used to love Samsung phones and the biggest reason I quit was ads.</p>
<p>That’s right, dear reader, I once very nearly switch to Samsung around the Galaxy Fold 2 / <a href="/2020/10/06/samsung-galaxy-note.html">Note 20 Ultra</a> era. They were great phones and I enjoyed using them to review, but what put me off in the end was that I felt like I was the product. Adverts would constantly be displayed in Samsung apps, such as Pay. They even went as far as sending notifications and adverts right <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-ads-your-samsung-phone">in your notification area</a> at some points. All of which completely put me off dealing with the company.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/eccbe0a8d2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you buy a cheap device, you expect companies to bundle in services and try to push you towards spending more money. You don’t, however, expect this when you spend upwards of £1,200 on a phone like the Fold 2 or Note 20 Ultra. Granted Samsung are possibly the worst offender in this space, and do similar things with their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/co5aw4/unremovable_ads_on_my_2500_samsung_smart_tv/">expensive TVs</a>, so we might be comparing Apples to Oranges, but it just feels off.</p>
<p>I absolutely expect a company to be pushed to make more and more money, and I understand that people have a strange perception of Apple as a whole, but it’s starting to feel a bit weird all of a sudden. There is nothing immediate to worry about, but after years and years of Apple telling us they don’t do adverts and <a href="https://gadgets360.com/internet/news/tim-cook-to-google-users-youre-not-the-customer-youre-the-product-594242">yelling at other companies</a> that treat their <a href="https://sigma.world/news/you-are-no-longer-the-customer-you-are-the-product-tim-cook/">customers as products</a>, it feels like the tide is turning.</p>
<p>Granted, these are only feelings, ones based on experiences with the worst of the worst, but I understand where some users are coming from. If we continue down this road, it could very well end up a disaster. However, rightly or wrongly, I do have faith that Apple will do this correctly. Unfortunately, I can look at the trashy adverts in Apple News and see a world where Tim Cook can’t be so preachy any more.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’ve been trying to formulate in my mind what I want to achieve with publishing online and my online life in general. Not to achieve like the world of content creation, worrying about metrics and income, but really what I do it for. What is the yardstick to measure things against if you aren&rsquo;t really concerned about the yards or the stick that people usually use? My publishing and my browsing habits really come down to three things — tools used, time available and the energy I have.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>In my modern life, I nearly always have enough tools available all the time. I do most of my <a href="/2022/10/03/mobile-publishing.html">writing on my iPhone</a>, this is in stark contrast to even a few months ago where I would always default to using my Mac. By choosing this separation, it felt a bit more organised and if I sat down to write, I wrote. Whereas now when I have an idea I capture it, or more often than not write the post there and then.</p>
<p>This means that my fingers could nearly always be busy. There are a few moments that I don’t have my phone with me, but I can always capture ideas because there is never a time I don’t have <a href="/2022/10/19/falling-for-the.html">my Apple Watch on</a>. Tools are seldom my problem now I’ve sorted out my publishing workflow.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/413cef77a6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="time">Time</h2>
<p>The biggest thing we all struggle with is time. Finding this in between all the things you have to do in our daily grind can be a task in itself. Thankfully, much like exercising, I can prioritise these above plenty of other things. For me, time spent scrolling social media or watch TV is better spent writing in a journal or publishing a blog post. My only comparison is against what else I could be doing because writing or reading others writing gives me lots of value.</p>
<p>With that said, others will value things differently. Some play games to unwind, some are artists, and some love doing nothing in front of the TV. There is no right or wrong here, just the result of lots of thinking and the occasional <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMusjixdf10">values audit</a>.</p>
<h2 id="energy">Energy</h2>
<p>For me, writing doesn’t always take a lot of time, but it takes some mental energy. A certain level of motivation needs to be achieved to get an idea from a small note into a publishable article. I used to take much less care of things, but despite the scruffy appearance of my blog posts, I do send some time on them.</p>
<p>Energy is also a big decider of where I want to put my reserves when I’ve been at work all day. Writing copy and staring at a computer all day doesn’t always mix very well with wanting to do the same thing when I come home. This is combatted somewhat by my mobile publishing workflow, but occasionally, my remaining energy is better off focused elsewhere. Playing with the kids or completing the endless lists of home jobs I have to do often gets priority here.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/96cb4d2afa.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>
<p>It all comes down to this. What do I want to achieve by writing the posts and publishing it? I am always conscious of not writing things to get replies and attention, and would rather get things out that help people. That might be to teach someone a new way of doing something tech related, or just show my thoughts behind topics I am thinking about.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I try to make sure that I don’t <a href="/2021/02/11/needing-feedback.html">expect anything in return</a> for the posts that I write, and that I am fine with that. The result is that I want to help others, or just get the thoughts that I am typing out to a conclusion and at which point I might as well publish them anyway. My blog posts are often a public journal of sorts and cover the topics and concerns I have at the time of writing. I do often wonder why I bother publishing things, but the result is always because I like to, and that&rsquo;s enough for me.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>As with everything in my technology life, I go backwards and forwards on the Apple Watch. On one hand, it gives me the perfect device to <a href="/2022/02/10/the-ultimate-minimalist.html">take me away from technology</a>, and on the other it’s another device to maintain and worry about. I’m always one for making my life easier and cutting tech out my life if I can do. With that said, after a bit of work and a few Shortcuts, I have fallen for it again.</p>
<p>Following a <a href="/2022/06/08/unplugging-should-be.html">little time unplugged,</a> I had been toying with the idea of putting my Apple Watch away for good. Whilst it did add some value into my life, I had come to the conclusion that it wasn’t enough. I held on a little longer due to rumours of a redesigned version in the upcoming months, so I kept my options open. I’m not a fan of this elongated squircle and have always wanted <a href="/2019/04/06/i-want-a.html">something more stylish</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/10f8913784.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Thankfully, the released Apple Watch Ultra didn’t really appeal to me, apart from my desire for <a href="/2022/09/24/i-think-i.html">something different on my wrist</a>. I blame Maique for this slightly because he <a href="https://micro.blog/maique/13513088">highlighted the usefulness</a> of the new action button he is using for updating his <a href="/2022/10/17/how-i-use.html">omg.lol Status</a>. Instead of spending £850 on a watch that would not suit my wrist just for a button, I have put some effort into making <em>my</em> Apple Watch work for me and in response, I love wearing it again.</p>
<p>The way I have done this, and the Shortcuts I have set up, are uniquely for me and not really the point of this post. It is more to point out how versatile technology can be with a little effort. By making the Apple Watch mine, within the very tight realms of what Apple allows, makes it much more useful. An Apple Watch could never replace other devices, but I can put my phone down even more so than before.</p>
<p>I would still like to see an action button on updated versions but for the time being I am very happy. This tiny computer on my wrist isn’t so bad after all.</p>

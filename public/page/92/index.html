     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Despite launching a new iPad only a few days ago, according to <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20200320VL201.html">DigiTimes</a>, the company still plans to go ahead with another new iPad version by the end of the year. This new version will one of a range of devices to feature a Mini LED display. “Apple reportedly prefers mini LED to OLED for its medium-size devices and will launch an iPad Pro with backlighting in the fourth quarter of 2020” they proclaim.</p>
<p>Rockstar Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/03/apple-14-1-inch-macbook-pro-mini-led/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> supports a similar idea that Apple will indeed launch an even higher-end iPad Pro with a mini-LED display in 2020 – an iPad Pro Pro if you will. So why precisely and where exactly would this fit into the lineup? That’s a difficult question to answer, but <em>could </em>this point to a larger-screened iPad.</p>
<p>I huge iPad isn’t a new idea, it’s one that has been swirling for years. Yet seems to have gathered pace again since the launch of the 3rd generation models. A modern design that makes infinitely more sense when placed on a desk due to the slimmer bezels and use of Face ID. Opinion posts started popping up again recently from <a href="https://www.imore.com/why-its-time-bigger-ipads">iMore</a> and <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/is-it-time-for-an-even-bigger-ipad-pro-19613750/">Slashgear</a>, to name a few, dreaming of a future with a larger desk iPad.</p>
<blockquote><p>On a product like the iPad, where the display is the device to a degree beyond a MacBook or iMac, offering even bigger screens is even more essential. Artists would have bigger canvases. Your apps would have more room in side-by-side and slide-over modes, or you could fit more on your screen when editing photos and videos. – Joseph Keller</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imore.com/why-its-time-bigger-ipads">for iMore</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed the new mouse and trackpad support in iOS 13.4 pushed the iPad even more towards desk usage while remaining amazingly portable.</p>
<p>Consistent improvements to the OS is leading even more people towards using an iPad as their only ‘computer’. The unavoidable trade-off of larger is reducing portability. Boost the screen size to 16″ and match the size of the MacBook Pro means the iPad is much easier to use on a desk, but terrible to carry around. The iPad is a tablet and touch first and foremost, so why should Apple even bother.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now that the trackpad and mouse support is happening, and considering that Apple has announced this before their usual info dump in June, one can’t help wonder if macOS or pro apps may be appearing on the iPad Pro soon. – Daryl Baxter for</p>
<p><a href="https://stealthoptional.com/tech/the-new-ipad-pro-and-ipados-14-could-massively-evolve-the-ipad/">Stealth Optional</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Cupertino could mediate this somewhat with better external monitor support. The current version means that the external screen is letterboxed and conforms to an iPad aspect ratio of 4:3. Whereas most motors you buy hover around the 16:9 ratio, leading to lots of wasted space. (The 11″ iPad is 1.33:1)</p>
<p>If Apple is indeed expecting Pros to seriously consider these devices, and let’s be <a href="https://stealthoptional.com/tech/the-new-ipad-pro-and-ipados-14-could-massively-evolve-the-ipad/">honest they should</a>, then a bigger larger screen is a must. Adobe launched Photoshop on the iPad last year and plan to release Illustrator later this year. So what exactly is stopping people? Unfortunately working paradigms and workflows that have been built up over years, then take years to break. So adopting non-standard computing can be too much for some.</p>
<p>However, an iPad Pro at any size that provides more computing power than most Laptops and you can draw on the screen is the perfect computer for ‘pros’. The iPad is already providing thousands of people the ability to carry around a touch-first tablet for <a href="https://gr36.com/the-ipad-goes-full-circle/">tradition consumption</a> but also power the majority of their work. It’s now time Apple help to turn those thousands into millions and offer the reasons for a switch.</p>
<p>I bigger iPad will help attract more users for drawing, video editing and loads of creative fields. This rumoured iPad Pro Pro could point to exactly that move. However, there are a few more bits Apple need to take the lead on to push this over the line, and fully release the iPad’s potential</p>

<blockquote><p>My original lack of interest with the watch started I think when I wasn’t going to work. Because that’s probably the only time that I felt I needed constant access to everything. Whether it’s the time, the weather, access to music that’s playing from a device just in my pocket, or all the notifications that I would instantly dismiss.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Now when I think about what I can actually gain from the Apple Watch, I’m not sure if I’m ever really going to wear it regularly again.</p></blockquote>
<p>I almost got to this point about a month ago. I even took my watch box (box full of regular watches) down to the jewellers and got the batteries replaced.</p>
<p>What stopped me in the end is being able to leave my phone at home more often and still be contactable. So instead of dropping the watch and using my phone more, I stopped using my phone nearly as much.</p>
<p>I can completely see where Chris is coming from though – Apples most personal device isn’t actually THAT useful when you don’t workout much and especially when you work from home.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I have now been working from home on and off for a little over a year. I am no whiz at this and haven’t done much remote work at all. However, I have read no end of guides because I suffered severely with procrastination and also had a considerable tendency to work too much. This sounds great at first because I am getting things done, but quickly turned into the fact that I was always working.</p>
<h2>Separate things</h2>
<p>Sounds easy, but can be super tricky depending on your home. You don’t need to have a large house, but you need to set aside some space for working. If you’ve got a spare bedroom or desk in a room not used regularly, you’re all set. However, you could also set aside virtual space if regular space is at a premium.</p>
<p>For example, you can work at your kitchen table, but when you’re not working, make sure all your stuff is away—laptop or computer out of sight and any desk things out the way. You begin to separate work and home time because your things are away, so it’s no longer work time.</p>
<h2>Plan Your Time Better</h2>
<p>When you’re in a working environment or an office is pretty easy to work on things because everyone around you should be working also. However, at home, two things can happen.</p>
<p>You don’t work enough – you get distracted but all the things in your home and neglect the work you should be doing.</p>
<p>You work too much – your home becomes your office, so you think you should always be working.</p>
<p>Both of these things are bad for your business and your mind. Block out periods in the day and take regular breaks. Working from home makes it easy  to do other things like workout or play computer games. You don’t have to work 9–5 – but make sure you still do the hours you’re expected to do.</p>
<p>I do this in a separate iCloud calendar and work to a strict <a href="https://gr36.com/todoist-my-new-app-to-get-things-done/">Todoist</a> plan of attack achieving certain things at certain times. I quite often plan this on a Sunday evening for the following work. Doesn’t mean it’s rigid, but its a frame to start with.</p>
<h2>Be Comfortable</h2>
<p>Don’t work at your kitchen table if it’s going to hurt your back. Not everyone has a desk and office chair to sit in, but do the best you can. Pillows and cushions are a useful tool for making you sit better, including supporting your lower back or raising your feet.</p>
<p>Become conscious of the way you are sitting and the type of work you are doing, and make changes if required. You can do yourself long term injury of you don’t pay attention.</p>
<p>Working from home should give you much more flexibility, depending on your companies outlook, but can cause some stress if you don’t plan well. Hopefully more people can start ditching <a href="https://gr36.com/regular-9-5/">the normal 9–5 grind</a>.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>First off the bat. I understand that I am in a ridiculously unique position that my employer trusts me and gives the freedom I need. So I am already coming from a privileged position compared to most people. With all that’s said –  I just can’t fit into a regular 9-5 job, and I don’t think most people should have to either.</p>
<p>You see, we all have the stuff to do. Things that don’t fit into the time after five and going to bed, or weekends. I have social workers to talk to, kids schools to meet with, medical things to sort out, and so does everyone else. I don’t mind working until late into the night to get things done if it means some freedom in the middle of the day to work out or run an errand.</p>
<p>In this climate, many people are introduced to working from home, and all the issues that go with it. But I’m hoping that this highlights the number of people that can and should be working more flexibly. Hopefully, more companies realise just how many positions can be filled by people that at least in part are allowed the flexibility to work from home.</p>
<p>I appreciate there are a considerable amount of jobs that just can’t be done any other way – but this draconian office working time is built on ideas that are old and showing their age. Business’ must trust their staff to accomplish the tasks assigned to them in a manner that suits both the requirements of the company and also the individual. If they do not trust the staff members enough to do this, then hard questions need to be asked about the staff they are employing in the first place or indeed the mentality of the management.</p>
<p>It’s nice to think that everyone should, and are, working at every point in the day but they’re enough checks and balances possible to ensure work gets done outside of office hours and freedom given to those that need it.</p>

<p>I have wondered for a long time the affects on eye sight of looking at a screens. You could chalk this up to the fact that we simply don’t need to look as far in the distance as we once did. Evolution works both ways I guess.</p>

     <p>One of the most prominent tones running through the indie web is being able to own your content. To publish it online and be able to do whatever you want with it. Some people publish to WordPress, some to Medium, others may build their own static sites, but the real problem with most of these approaches is being able to move your content to somewhere else easily.</p><p>I first ran into this pain when closing down my very first WordPress website. I’d been working hard on building a Jekyll based static site because hosting was becoming expensive, and it was the best place to put everything. When it comes to all blog posts and images, it proved a nightmare. Sure there are ways to do it, <a href="https://blog.webjeda.com/wordpress-to-jekyll-migration/">kind of</a>. However, none of the options work very well, or even at all. So you’re left to slog through all of your posts and copy them over.</p><p>Pretty easy to do if you’re only a few in, but a mammoth task if you’re as post happy as I am or been witting for several years. Several times during the process, I considered giving up, and a lesser person may have done so, begging the question of if this is intentional? If you own your content, then it should be easy to move from place to place, and platforms really should think about this as a selling point to their hosting.</p><p>Jeff Perry, the master of moving his blog to different providers, feels this <a href="https://jeffperry.blog/2020/03/2/%F0%9F%94%97-the-great-blog-cleanup">more than anyone</a>. He found WordPress to be a massive pain, and only Blot creator David Murfiled goes out of his way to help.</p><blockquote><em>I will say moving to Blot was easy because the creator, Dave, is probably the most helpful and responsive person I’ve ever worked with. When I was using  </em><br /><br /><em><a href="https://t.co/OfH9MKIBh8?amp=1">[micro.blog](http://micro.blog)</a></em><br /><br /><em> I felt that the back end was needlessly complicated, and for WordPress, my worst experience was with WordPress themselves because they charge up the ass for little support – Jeff Perry</em></blockquote><p>Manton Reece creator of micro.blog <a href="https://www.manton.org/2017/11/24/blog-archive-format.html">talked about this quite a while ago</a>, and proposed that providers implement a standard. Whenever I hear these calls for a standard to be implemented, I am always reminded of the <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">XDCD comic</a>.<br /></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/cc8fb1a291.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Standards 1" loading="lazy" title="standards-1.png" /></figure><p>But clearly, something needs to be done. Each platform offers the ability to import and export options, but very few of these work together, or much fo the time even work very well. Indeed micro.blog is the only platform I have seen that goes so far as to make your import go as smoothly as possible. Creating bespoke options for Instagram, Medium, WordPress, Jekyll and many others. I can’t speak for getting your content out again, but the transparency of this service should help at least a little.</p><p>During a recent round trip to Ghost Pro, and back again, I imported and exported all of my posts 3 or 4 times. Even though I was doing this on the same platform, this still didn’t work fully. Leaving me to trawl through all of my posts and add in missing images and move data to the correct place. So even the self-proclaimed <a href="https://ghost.org/">home of independent publishing</a> suffers from the same old issues as everyone else. Platforms want your data, but don’t want you to take it again without some pain.</p>

<p>It isn’t very often something truly new comes to market. All right we’ve seen folding phones before, but not one this particular way, and not one available to the  mass market. The Galaxy Fold was horrendously expensive and had some longevity concerns, and as yet you can’t buy the Moto Razr <a href="https://shop.ee.co.uk/mobile-phones/pay-monthly/motorola-razr-black/details?WT.MC_ID=ON_MEC_S_700000000044366_Brand+_+PAYM+_+Motorola+_+RAZR+_+Hybrid+_+EXACT_p50199620492&amp;WT.srch=1&amp;s_kwcid=AL!932!3!404227664639!e!!g!!ee%20motorola%20razr&amp;mchannel=ppc&amp;ds_rl=1238748&amp;logo=TUR1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAs67yBRC7ARIsAF49CdWzBMN56EYSPHpTgdeM5p9ycaXBDLMqCRk7vkHF7f3huKKrbntWwq0aAgbIEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">other than on an expensive 24 month</a> contract on EE. So when the chance came for me to not only get <a href="https://gr36.com/galaxy-fold-handson/">hands on with one</a> but use one – I got <a href="https://gr36.com/advance-tech-exciting/">a tad over excited</a>.</p>
<p>Ok, the Galaxy Z Flip has some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/16/21139897/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-ultra-thin-glass-durability-scratch-test-jerryrigeverything">longevity concerns of its own</a>, but I don’t think that is enough to dismiss such a new device.  It’s easy to be dismissive of something that doesn’t fit into your vision of what a device should be. Yet all others around me got excited when I first took the phone out of the box and that speaks volumes. All the insides of the Z Flip box are standard Samsung, yet when you take the phone out and peel off the plastic, something entirely different happens.</p>
<p>The device feels sturdy and reassuring, well built and engineered, but not bulky or uncomfortable. Not only much more comfortable and lighter than an iPhone 11, but considerably taller and slimmer. I am reminded of the memes that were made around the time of the iPhone 5 launch, and when you use a device like the Galaxy Z Flip and indeed the Note10 line, it shows how right Apple were back then. A slimmer taller screen is better in almost every way.</p>
<h2>Real Talk After The Fold</h2>
<p>The folding screen of the Z Flip is both marvelled and ridiculed at each point by technology commentators, but you can’t argue its usefulness. You may scoff and think that the Galaxy Fold is a much more useful device, but that the Z flip does allow me to have a 6.7″ screen device, but not feel one in my pocket. When not in use the device slims down to about the same size as a coaster, all be it a heavier one that feels a little weird in your pocket.</p>
<p>When in use the screen is comically tall, there is no getting around it. One handed use can be a little clumsy if the app you’re using is top-heavy, but a tall screen gives you a great way to consume written content, be it social media, emails or blog posts. I love reading on this device because it’s much more suited to 90% of web usage and fits nicely in your palm. The screen itself is bright and vivid, some will scoff at it ‘only’ being 1080p but it does it’s job well with no issues.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Galxy-Z-Flip-In-Hand-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1ddd0502ae.jpg" alt="Galxy Z Flip In Hand 1" width="2000" height="1125" border="0" />The only issue with scrolling vertically on this screen in particular is the crease in the middle. It is unavoidable, you <em>can</em> see it, and anyone that says otherwise is mistaken. It sticks out like a sore thumb, mainly when using a dark UI (which I much prefer) or when the screen is empty of content. Even if you get used to seeing the crease after a few days of use like the notch on the iPhone; you feel it every time you swipe around and if you want a folding phone you have to find a way to make peace with this fact.</p>
<h2>Minimalist Phone?</h2>
<p>That shouldn’t put you off though, the crease is unapologetic. It is there the first time you pick the device up and won’t go away. But it also shouldn’t get any worse, because it is purposely <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1228736762186551297?s=20">put there by Samsung</a> in the factory, so it doesn’t develop over time. It doesn’t go as far as ruining your experience of the phone; it is just something that is a trade-off for having a folding phone at this point in time. If having a crease in the screen bothers you, steer clear, but it’s a worthwhile trade-off for being able to fold your phone in half and put it away.</p>
<p>While we are here, it seems logical to talk about folding the phone in half, because you won’t be able to stop – perhaps ever. The hinge gives tactical feedback but also provides a smooth transition. Samsung says its a semi-rigid hinge, allowing for it to be used in that weird half folded way that Samsung thinks will appeal to ‘influencers’. So gone is the click into place that Galaxy Fold had when opening, to be replaced by a more pleasant experience. Unfortunately, you won’t be doing the communicator flip open like the devices of old – well you can, but it doesn’t <a href="https://twitter.com/theMrMobile/status/1228410045823582215?s=20">work very well</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a finality of closing the Z Flip that you don’t get with other devices. Something akin to putting the lid down on your laptop. It draws a line under your phone usage and puts it away. It will help those looking to minimalise their phone usage because the screen is now away and out of tempting site. It’s not as if you can do anything on the ridiculous front screen anyway.</p>
<p>If Samsung are going for a way to minimalist your phone, they hit the nail on the head, because the front display is ridiculous. Perhaps not in a wrong way, but I wish they have thought about using it a little more. Not going as far as they did with the Galaxy Fold, but an active display similar to the Razr would have been perfect. You are not going to do anything with this screen except glimpse notifications when they come in and check the time.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="DSC0029-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a89a5a5cc5.jpg" alt="DSC0029 1" width="599" height="337" border="0" />I don’t want to comment on battery life much further than to say that I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t last you a day of usage. During my two days taking photos and playing with the phone, it still has more than 25% battery left after taking it off charge at 7 am. After a bit more usage, I will share full battery life expectations.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>On the initial set up and test, I was disappointed with the performance of the camera, but there was a software update waiting for that improved things dramatically. I have a feeling this update is not installed on demo devices and some hands on versions I have seen, so perhaps take some video revews with a small pinch of salt.</p>
<p>I have to prefaces all my words with the fact I am not a fan of the processing done by Samsungs cameras. They often look overly processed sometimes downright ridiculous colour saturation in them. I prefer something much more natural-looking, and I am undeniably used to iPhone images.</p>
<p>As well as the usual family snaps, I took the Galaxy Z Flip with me on a day out to <a href="https://www.thedeep.co.uk/">The Deep Aquarium</a>, mainly because it is often one of the most challenging environments to get good snaps in. Dark rooms, with brightly lit tanks full of colourful fish that don’t stay still. I must say I am very impressed with its performance, not everything came out perfectly, but there were very few pictures I had to delete. At times I have often struggled to make Samsung cameras work for me, even as recently as the Note 10+ – having to turn features off and dial back processing – but this is not one of these times. Find a gallery below.</p>

<p>Galaxy Z Flip Around The Home</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am at a certain point in my life where each iPhone is as boring as the last one. I am excited by what other brands are doing and am always tempted to use something else but never do. I never want to say I will or won’t do anything else but switch back to an iPhone but using the Z Flip has opened my eyes to a brand new world. I enjoy the feel of having a much smaller device in my pocket and folding it out when needed – and to be honest, I also said this about the Galaxy Fold.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Z Flip is another step up in use case, a device that offers an improvement where the Galaxy Fold felt like you had to use gloves on it, but also an eye-opening form factor switch. The taller, slimmer screen is much easier to use and displays much of what I do online all day much better than anything else.</p>
<p>Pulling out the Z Flip leaves people around you genuinely amazed, and I have had loads of questions about it. Sure we are all aware these phones exist, but the general public doesn’t seem to be. Unfortunately, when showing it off, the black version I have is a fingerprint magnet, the same as the black Note10+ I had, so I spend far too much time is spent wiping off the body. The finish is also a bit too slippery than I would like, couple this with the smaller frame to carry and I feel a little uneasy using it outside.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="DSC0036-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8a8a85b8cf.jpg" alt="DSC0036 1" width="599" height="337" border="0" />With all these words out the way – I am at a point as I write this that I am stuck at a Schrödinger’s phone. I both think the device is a game-changing smartphone and also a bit of a gimmick. Depending on the time of day, I am both marvelled and miffed at the Galaxy Z Flip. It offers me a use case like nothing before but is it worth a whopping £1300 price tag?</p>
<p>By far Galaxy Z Flip is the best folding phone you can buy. It is also a terrific smartphone that offers a brand new use case never before seen. I am just not 100% convinced that use case warrants the price tag or if it exists at all. I love using the Galaxy Z Flip because it is something completely new, but will that wear thin over time? Is this a solution to something that doesn’t need solving? These are all questions in my head and unique to each person.</p>
<p>What I woudl say is the dismissive feeling I have seen towards this phone are cimoletely unwarranted. This device feels like the start of something special and there is no denying it. I will try and answer the rest of the questions I have over the coming days – stay tuned.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The folding things are coming. You can’t get away from it. When I say things, I mean all sorts of things are going to be foldable, and it doesn’t matter your definition. It could be a tablet that folds into a phone-sized device or a phone that folds into something smaller. That fact that this year proves to be genuinely exciting for foldable devices should be enough.</p>
<p>The scepticism is somewhat understandable given the false starts with both the Galaxy Fold and Huawei Mate X, but now phones such as the Moto Razr and Galaxy Z Flip are hitting the mass market this should be fading. However, there seems to be lots of negativity still.</p>
<p>The detractors against such a device are vocal when any mention of both the Razr and Z Flip are spoken about on social media. With a consensus that a folding phone is pointless. To a certain degree that may be the case for your use case, but the fact that these devices are now available – with the latter sporting a glass screen – should be enough to get excited about.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/96f4685a1b.jpg" alt="960x0 1" title="960x0-1.jpg" border="0" width="599" height="395" />The fact that Samsung has made such a huge step forward just months <a href="https://gr36.com/galaxy-fold-handson/">after the Galaxy Fold</a> was released is bordering on insane. If this kind of pace of innovation can be maintained, then devices that will appeal to you as a consumer are right around the corner. Not every device is made of every type of user, but the fact remains that these devices are made for some users and selling very well.</p>
<p>Opinions regarding the device not appealing to your use case are one thing, but detracting from such a significant improvement in technology is another. It is an exciting prospect to have such a device hit the shelves, and I, for one, would love to get hands-on with one soon.</p>

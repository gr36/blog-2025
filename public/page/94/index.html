     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’m not too fond of ads. I promised myself I would never show them on my blog and hate the way they looked on websites that did. With all this said, I have turned some on for a little experiment and wanted to share why.</p>
<p>I have never made a penny from writing, podcasting or making videos. I have never tried to really and never expect to. However, after writing for more than seven years, I have noticed that some posts get traction long after I have posted them and seem to be serving a purpose to people.</p>
<p>Guides like my repairing a DJI Spark controller get more than 100 views a day, they are helping people out, and I am happy about that. On digging into my site stats (I don’t do this very often) I discovered that 92% of these people are bouncing immediately off the site. They are merely using this page they found from Googling, getting the information and leaving.</p>
<p>I do get the very occasional email thanking me for publishing the information, one reader in particular, asked to send me some money because I solved his issue with his Lumia stuck when booting. However, most people are not reading very much.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with that; we all do it multiple times a day. However, these people are not engaging with me, not my followers and not likely to be. So I figured a small ad on pages like this wouldn’t hurt, it might give me a few pounds towards my site, but also might not.</p>
<p>Ghost makes it pretty easy for me to put a simple HTML block in the middle of posts that I want to try and monetise, so I’ve dropped a few into old posts that still get found on the net. What I don’t want is to have loads displaying all over the page, and ruin the content. I am now writing much more than I used so maybe one day I will make some money.</p>

<p>I still blame <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/the-biggest-change-to-birchtree-in-5-years/">Matt Birchler</a> for putting the idea in my head, I was quite happy on WordPress (not completely but pretty happy) and then he comes in and introduces <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost to me</a>, and I moved within a few days. On first look it seems like a ridiculously expensive option, and more suited to larger companies, but if you don’t want to splash out the $29/per month there are other options.</p>
<p>If you want to get a Ghost blog set up, its pretty easy to host it ‘yourself’,  here is a short guide on doing it on a Digital Ocean droplet.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-01-21-at-10.05.43-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9cb8be9542.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 01 21 at 10 05 43 1" width="1000" height="771" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Create A Droplet</h2>
<p>Signing up for a Digital Ocean account and creating a droplet is really straight forward. Most blogs will only need a $5 a month droplet unless you are getting serious traffic.</p>
<p>Click on Market place under ‘Choose an image’, this does allow you to choose loads of different options – but if you’re reading this guide you’ll find Ghost under ‘blogs and forums’. Once selected you will see a guide underneath detailing your requirements after your droplet is set up. On this page you will also find all information about the version being installed.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-01-21-at-10.06.10-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/91ebd54149.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 01 21 at 10 06 10 1" width="1000" height="771" border="0" />It won’t matter too much where your data centre is, so choose your preference – if things like GDPR and also government monitoring are important to you, then choose wisely. Give your droplet and name and then let it do its thing.</p>
<h2>After Creation</h2>
<p>Once completed, you will receive an email from Digital Ocean with your Droplet IP address and SSH password. Keep this information extremely safe and do not share with anyone.</p>
<h3>Point Your Domain</h3>
<p>On your Digital Ocean Project page, add your domain. This will populate the NS records and give you your name severs. This is more than likely going to be <code>ns1.digitalocean.com.</code>, <code>ns2.digitalocean.com.</code> and <code>ns3.digitalocean.com.</code> – add these to your domain settings.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-01-21-at-10.28.45-copy-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/884cf8140a.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 01 21 at 10 28 45 copy 1" width="1000" height="384" border="0" />Also add in an A record in Digital Ocean, with a host name of <code>@</code> and direct it to your IP address of the droplet. It is vitally important you wait for all changes to propagate before continuing otherwise you may have issues with setting up Ghost. I would advise you to wait 24 hours.</p>
<p>Once you are happy the domain information has properly propagated, continue to setting up the blog.<br /><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="pasted-image-0-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/28616a5c60.jpg" alt="Pasted image 0 1" width="599" height="247" border="0" /></p>
<h3>SSH Into Your Droplet</h3>
<p>Nothing will be live until you SSH into your droplet and set up Ghost. You should see a page telling you as mush if your domain has propagated correctly. Open your terminal and type in:<br /><code>ssh root@your-ip-address</code></p>
<p>The sever will ask for your password, copy and paste this in, and then immediately make you change it. You will need to put your current one in again, and then choose a new one – Keep this safe!</p>
<p>Once this is done Ghost will download updates and set itself up. Press Enter.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="pasted-image-0-2-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/54a20989c1.jpg" alt="Pasted image 0 2 1" width="598" height="149" border="0" /><br />You won’t need to put in any details about SQL databases or directories, you <em>will</em> have to put in your blog URL. Do this with the <code>https://</code> on and Ghost will set up your Let Encrypt certificate for you. This is where the installation will fall down if your domain is not properly propagated.</p>
<p>Ghost will be installed and set up at <code>/var/www/ghost</code></p>
<p>If everything goes ok, you will be given a url of <em>https://your-url/ghost</em>. Head to this address and set up your profile and blog title. If you want to migrate from WordPress, here’s some <a href="https://gr36.com/migrating-from-wordpress-to-ghost/">points to consider</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>There is a whole spectrum of issues that can come up for people regarding their significant other’s internet presence,” says Gray. “From things like, ‘Why are you always liking this model’s photographs?’ or ‘Why haven’t you been liking my posts lately?’ all the way to ‘I would really prefer if you didn’t scroll through your feed while we are eating together.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am always constantly surprised on the level of thought that goes into social media etiquette. On recently reshuffling my twitter and trying to move people into lists some people reached out and complained I unfollowed them – which I guess sis understandable. But couples have whole issues, and more than likely ended relationships, over their other half’s online footprints.</p>
<p>Personally I couldn’t care less one what others do and what pictures the doubles tap, but we do have a constant issue at home on the usage of tech in family times. My wife had a skill, that I don’t, to be able to watch a television program and also scroll through Facebook and also chat to her friends.</p>
<p>I am left with what I call ‘residual attention’ and it’s slim to none.</p>

     <p>I have been using <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/bear-the-serious/">Bear notes for years now</a>, it’s by far my favourite app for writing, and goes far beyond a simple notes app. The great thing is it keeps getting better and better without overly complicating things and becoming hard to use – not to mention it looks gorgeous.</p>
<p>The recent update to <a href="https://twitter.com/BearNotesApp/status/1219258627816665097">Version 1.7.8</a> brings in some improvements to tag icons but also an automated way to import your Apple Notes. This is something that has been lacking, not due to the developers, but to Apple’s locked down approach to notes, unlike importing from other apps which has existed for quite awhile.</p>
<p>This is a bit of a workaround, and unfortunately you can only do this process on Mac.</p>
<h2 id="mac-use-our-automator-workflow">Mac: use our Automator Workflow</h2>
<p><a href="https://sf-applications.s3.amazonaws.com/Bear/utils/NotesExporter.workflow.zip">Download our Automator Workflow</a>  Minimum system requirements: macOS 10.10 Yosemite<br />We built an Automator Workflow for macOS that can export all your Apple Notes as HTML files. This will include most note contents, but not all. See the breakdown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text, lists, and photos should be included</li>
<li>Note: only macOS 10.15 Catalina supports photo export. On earlier macOS versions, Apple Notes will not export photos</li>
<li>Task lists convert into bulleted lists</li>
<li>Rich media links will convert to plain text links</li>
<li>Non-photo attachments like PDFs or other files are not supported and will be excluded from export to HTML files. They will remain safely in Apple Notes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-use-this-automator-workflow">How to use this Automator Workflow</h3>
<ul>
<li>Download our AppleScript</li>
<li>Double-click it to open Automator</li>
<li>Press the Play button</li>
<li>Choose or create a new folder to store your exported Apple Notes</li>
<li>In Bear, click File &gt; Import Notes</li>

<p>This is everything wrong with startup and VC culture. A business that at the time was processing over $2.5million a month is deemed worthless in Silicone valley because it isn’t growing 20%, or being floated for $1billion.</p>
<p>I yearn for the day we stop valuing companies on how much money they can borrow or how many users they can grow, and start looking at the viability of the product and the profit it makes – you know, like a real business.</p>

     <p>I’m going to be completely honest, this wasn’t easy for me – it was supposed to be straight forward, but everything that could have gone wrong did. I took the inspiration from <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/the-biggest-change-to-birchtree-in-5-years/">Matt Birchler</a> to post about my migration and the issues I faced in the hope someone else won’t run into the same.</p>
<h2 id="exporting-from-wordpress"><strong>Exporting From WordPress</strong></h2>
<p>The easiest way to do this is through the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ghost/">Ghost export plugin</a>. The plugin promises to download all of your posts, pages, and information into an easy to import ZIP file. Unfortunately, I haven’t met anyone yet that this has worked correctly.</p>
<p>In preparation, you will need to think about the categories you have on your blog. Ghost works on tags and not categories, so this information needs to be transferred before you export. Use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpcat2tag-importer/">Categories to Tags converter</a> plugin and run this once before export.</p>
<p>Also if you are a lone blogger, make sure your user account has the same email address as the one used on WordPress. If they are different the import will set up another User account that is locked. Deleting this user also deletes all of the posts, and short of transferring each post over individually, you are a bit stuck.</p>
<p>I had to switch to using the JSON option as the exporter kept timing out, even when I increased the memory available and also the time limit to infinite. This JSON file will only give you post and page content, not images to go along with it.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" title="imports-and-exports-in-Ghost-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3ad9506b40.jpg" alt="Imports and exports in Ghost 1" /></figure>
<h2 id="importing-to-ghost"><strong>Importing To Ghost</strong></h2>
<p>Once you’ve set up your blog on Ghost, log into the dashboard, go to Labs &gt; Import content &gt; Choose your file. The process is swift, and at the end, all of your posts and pages will be live on your site. If you’ve managed to export a zip file, you have nothing more to do other than check through your posts and make sure you are happy with them.</p>
<p>Due to my issues, I had the job of downloading all of my images from 7 years of posts and combing through each post to put them in. I tried to import all of my images into the recommended <code>content/images</code> folder; however, I used this opportunity to tidy up the folder.</p>
<p>There is no reason a bulk import of images wouldn’t work providing you keep the same structure as your WordPress blog. However, bear in mind that WordPress stores multiple versions of the same image at different sizes so your images folder is going to be overinflated – if storage space is an issue for you then consider doing some work to tidy up beforehand.</p>
<p>Now all I had to work about is a theme, and setting up my <a href="https://gr36.com/how-to-set-up-ghost-link-posts-using-canonical-url/">link posts</a>!</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" title="Blog-screenshot-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/40f2b21bb6.jpg" alt="Blog screenshot 1" /></figure>
<h2 id="improvements"><strong>Improvements</strong></h2>
<p>If I did this again, I would work a little more on editing the JSON to my liking and making everything run a little smoother. More information on doing your import can be found on the <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/api/v3/migration/">Ghost site.</a>  My move was time sensitive as my hosting was coming to an end, but given more time, I would work on a testing domain with Ghost and spend more time on the import and set up.</p>
<p>Exporting and importing from hosting platforms needs to become more uniform. Manton Reece, the creator of micro.blog, has called for an <a href="https://www.manton.org/2017/11/24/blog-archive-format.html">implemented standard</a> to make things much more comfortable to move around. It is times like this when you wish something existed. Many applications spend time working on importing from other options, so perhaps it’s time this becomes a consideration to those that run blogging platforms.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve always recorded my podcast weekly, edited and then released it a few days later. Four years later and I’ve never done anything differently, but the release of Charlie Chapman new podcast <a href="https://launchedfm.com/">Launched</a> has got me thinking about bingeing podcasts and when to release my own.</p>
<p>In general, I’ve never been swept away by podcasts. There are a few I have found and then gone back to listen to entire back catalogues, but shows like <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a> or the million other crime things have never been my thing. But I think these Audio dramas are created with this in mind, consumed in one go. Although recently I listened to the entirety of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07nkd84/episodes/downloads">The missing crytoqueen</a> on a long journey, and if I had to wait a week between episodes, it would have been a nightmare.</p>
<p>At the moment I am recording 2 or 3 in a week and then leaving a couple of weeks before I record any more. It is allowing me to spread out my work editing and book a few more guests or focus on other things. With this in mind, I <em>could</em> drop 2 or 3 all at once and then record the others in the next few weeks? Or should I have a mass record and then release 5 or 6 all at once? Perhaps I am putting too much thought into it.</p>
<p>It is a hard decision and one that Netflix and other streaming services are having to make. Do you release all episodes at once to create a real buzz, but then it be short-lived, or string it out for longer?</p>
<p>Many more shows fall back on series, or releasing several shows all at once and then working on a new run. Working like this seems based on the TV model, and if I may say so seems like an old school way of working. However, this does allow for better storytelling, and also should cut down on the editing if you are duplicating introductions, sound design and other things.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my brain is still leaning towards avoiding the idea of podcast ‘seasons’ – I don’t think it’s suited to anything other than audio dramas. Yet now I’m recording more conversations that are not time-sensitive, I’m more inclined to record a few and either release all at once rather than once a week. What do you think is best?</p>

<p>First off – this is no guarantee, but it should help.</p>
<p>The secret sauce to finding you iPhone after you’ve looked in the obvious places is Apples trusty ‘Find My’ App. Previously called find my iPhone, it will also track your Apple Watch, iPad, Mac’s and even AirPods. To do this is need location access and many people don’t give it enough access to be able to do the best job it can.</p>
<p>Privacy is a huge deal, and this is understandable, but should the worst happen you really want to track down your device as quickly and easily as possible. I have spent 20 mins rooting through my car, only to then trace my AirPods to being back at home on my desk – this tip may help recover your device and calm you down.</p>
<h2>Send Last Location</h2>
<p>The secret is allowing your device to update its location when it is used. This is stored by Apple and no one else – but it’s understandable if you don’t want to do this.</p>
<p>When you open the ‘Find my’ app for the first time you will be prompted to allow this. If you’ve missed it or now want to turn it on head to Settings &gt; Tap Your Name at the top &gt; Find My &gt; Find My Device &gt; and toggle on Send Last Location.</p>
<p>There is also an option to allow offline location. This will allow a location even if the device hasn’t got a data connection by pinging other Apple devices around it. This is similar to how Tile works and is linked to the much rumour Apple version.</p>
<p>You could also consider sharing your location with friends of family members so they can also track down devices for you, however this has its own pitfalls!</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When I picked up the very first iPad on the day of the launch, I knew this device would open a different world. Universally panned as bigger iPhone, many critics didn’t see a future for a device type already tried a few times over. However, Apple knew, as well as I did, that this market would open up given enough time.</p>
<p>Yet this first device I held in my hand had a small market and very few uses. Apple touted a future of computing filled with devices such as these, and even if you choose to slash for the accompanying keyboard dock, there still wasn’t much you could do on an iPad – short of it being indeed a bigger iPhone.</p>
<p>With this, the vast majority of usage became consumption, social media browsing, watching a video and surfing the web. Sure it replaced many seldom-used laptops in people homes, but it didn’t do much more to show us the future. Users saw no reason to upgrade, and while a few began to see the potential as the iPad became sleeker and more powerful. It wasn’t until I picked up an iPad Air that I had to work on, that posts like Federico’s <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-2-review-why-the-ipad-became-my-main-computer/">initial deluge of guides</a> on MacStories opened the floodgates.</p>
<p>My rage quitting of the iPad dragged out longer than it should do and came to a head earlier this year. I shared <a href="https://gr36.com/today-is-the-day-i-quit-the-ipad/">my disappointment in the failures of iOS</a> and also my change in circumstances that lead to its demise in my life. The iPad Pro was no longer the device I enjoyed using and no longer one my life could support. I couldn’t justify a more than £1300 investment to need a Mac around as well. I don’t regret using the iPad as my computer; ultimately if my life remained as nomadic as it once was, I might have remained a die-hard user.</p>
<p>However, a brand new 10.2 iPad <a href="https://amzn.to/36fhkbj">is £289 at time of writing</a>, a deal that is hard to turn down. I don’t need an iPad to be a working machine any longer; I need it to fill a gap of reading blog posts, my pocket feed and watching videos when I want to relax. So the iPad returns to its starting position. Nestled in among other Apple devices, and one I use to consume. Waiting its turn amongst threes Macs and an iPhone. Sure I could pick up a pencil and a keyboard to go with it – but there is little point as the iPad has gone full circle.</p>

<p>How many of us spend life flitting in and out of the present time? Any given moment, we are away and into our thoughts with limited awareness of what is going on around us. It’s good to sit and just think about things, but being present in the current moment is as relevant, and I believe this needs more attention and thought.</p>
<p>Only when you are aware of where your attention is that you become aware that it is very rarely on where it should be. Yet when I sit and think I often find myself unable to stay focused and succumb to distractions if I am not paying attention. My mind wanders all over the place, from thought to thought and down avenues that it really should not.</p>
<p>When I sit and meditate that I can begin to let things go and indeed empty my mind of thoughts, my mind becomes present, and I can focus entirely – the fog starts to lift. Mindful of where my thoughts are going and able to come back to what is essential.</p>
<p>Just thinking is harder than it seems in an age of constant stimulation, but not impossible. Thinking about things is not the same as letting your thoughts run free; it takes practice and attention to what is going on. Otherwise, there is a genuine risk or “miles away” from those around you.</p>

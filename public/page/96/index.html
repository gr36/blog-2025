  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s that time of the year again; the weather takes a turn for the worst and people (usually Americans) start moaning about having to shovel snow. These types of posts could be a little tongue in cheek, and I have no doubt you are excerpting yourself, but you don’t need a workout type. Some need adding to the Apple Watch such as sport types and training methods, which are slowly being increased- what it doesn’t need is ‘Yardwork’, ‘snow shovelling’ or rocking your baby.</p>
<p>Thankfully the Apple Watch team has now found its market. Instead of a spray and pray device that does everything, its aim is notifications and Heath. Motioning all your workouts and keeping you more engaged with people. Workouts and activity don’t need to be overly complicated by every single time you exert yourself by doing daily tasks. There is a risk of adding too much and again making the Apple Watch too cluttered and too complicated.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="apple-watch-workouts-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5ec7f7796e.jpg" alt="Apple watch workouts 1" width="1000" height="399" border="0" /></p>
<p>These types of general are covered regardless of if you start a workout or not. It will detect your heart rate and movement increases and give you relevant move points. You’re exerting yourself so the activity ring will start to climb accordingly. If you’re dead set on recording it as a workout, start the ‘other’ one and then give it a name at the end if you’re ever going to review it. You’ll be forgiven to forget that there is another option because more often than not, it is hidden down at the bottom of your activity options.</p>
<p>You get the same activity credit as a brisk walk, which is around 60 calories per 15 mins. Which is pretty low if you are working hard, so your best bet will be to let your Apple Watch detect how hard you are working and adjust accordingly. You will move your red and yellow rings regardless of you paying attention to them or not – that’s the great thing about Apple Watch.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2019/11/20/how-i-use.html"><h1 class="p-name">How I Use Agenda</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Agenda-featured.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ce935fbf77.jpg" alt="Agenda featured" width="1000" height="500" border="0" />For the last few weeks, I have been throwing my life into Agenda, I’ve played around with it previously, but this time it seems to have stuck. I’m one of those people that like to try out an app or service just because people are using it, and this is what I did in 2018 when Agenda won the apple design award. I think I had signed up previously to use it on Mac but didn’t hang around very long.</p>
<p>The only issue is this is a completely different approach to note taking. It ditches the somewhat traditional approach of a list of notes, in folders and turns it on its head. Everything is based around your calendar and dates. You can of course make notes without this, but its main power stems from tying into events in your life. For years I have been living out of my calendar and task management app (or apps), and I’ve been searching for a service that does it all for me. I feel like I have tried everything, from <a href="https://gr36.com/todoist-my-new-app-to-get-things-done/">Todoist</a> to <a href="https://gr36.com/using-notion-web-clipper/">Notion</a>, to more recently <a href="https://gr36.com/using-apple-notes-to-write-in-2019/">Apple Notes</a>. My life is split into to distinct area and Agenda is already benefiting me in both.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Work</strong></strong></h2>
<p>I am a development and engagement manager for a UK based insurance company. In essence, this entails a massive balancing act involving loads of meeting, emails and tasks to be completed. I work from an iMac at my desk, an iPad in conferences and an iPhone at every other time, so having a cross-platform app with great sync is required.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="agenda-usage-iphone-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4a85328499.jpg" alt="Agenda usage iphone 1" width="1000" height="477" border="0" /></p>
<h3><strong><strong>Meetings</strong></strong></h3>
<p>These are exchange meetings set up in Outlook, the only thing that stops me using Agenda for calendar management is the missing option to add invitees. This is not a massive issue for me, as I’m in Outlook for email anyway. From these events, I create all of my meeting preparation in Agenda, including all my written notes, clipped images some times also documents.</p>
<p>The benefit of being able to add in documents that I can refer too quickly in meetings is a godsend. The fact I don’t need to go into a room armed with loads of paperwork any more is a huge benefit. I also won’t lose any following it; if anything is handed to me, I can insert a scan of the document using my phone with a single click.</p>
<p>Granted this looks a little weird depending on who your meeting is with, thankfully my sessions are usually in tech or design people, and everyone else has just gotten used to my weirdness. Mainly because I can email a meeting review, including all documents, or print out a version within minutes of leaving the room. Exporting from Agenda is a massive benefit over something like Evernote or Apple Notes; it is powerful and flexible to fit into most situations.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>Collecting Info</strong></strong></h3>
<p>The second part of my job is producing content through various channels. For this, I have a section for work ‘in progress’ and create a project for putting things together. Mainly containing video scripts and outlines for blog posts, but some other random info I want to store. As much as Agenda is date focused, it works <em><em>ok</em></em> with saving some general info, but shouldn’t be seen as a note app replacement if you need to store loads of info. Because Agenda is date focused, I can collect all this together and make reminders right up to the ‘due date’.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2019-11-20-at-17.53.44-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/71dbd552b3.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2019 11 20 at 17 53 44 1" width="1000" height="672" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong><strong>Home</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The second part of my life revolves around my family. I am the parent of two children, one of whom is disabled, so date focused note-taking is more or less a given. Our calendar is filled full of hospital appointments, school events and other things that I need information on.</p>
<h3><strong><strong>Hospitals</strong></strong></h3>
<p>My agenda home section has a general project for my daughter’s hospital appointments, filled full of notes that refer to older appointments. No longer am I searching for information, or trying to remember what we discussed at the last appointment. Much like my work meetings, if I need to scan a medication label, or snap a picture of recommended equipment, I can put it right into the Agenda note. I also like to send my wife and parents a text with the notes in, which Agenda lets me do with a couple of taps.</p>
<h3><strong><strong>Technology</strong></strong></h3>
<p>I love writing and talking about technology, I’ve tried for more than seven years to stop, but something about it gets me excited. I take notes for upcoming episodes of my podcast, <a href="https://byodpodcast.com/">Bring Your Own Device</a>, linked to the calendar event I share with my co-host. I would love to have collaboration, this would cut out our show notes Apple Note, but these notes are for my talking points only.</p>
<p>I also outline and write every blog post I publish in an Agenda Note. Taking the same form as with my work life, what I love is that I can drag in images and text from other sources as reference.</p>
<p><br /><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8335452151565777" data-ad-slot="5524743860"></ins></p>
<p>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</p>
<h3><strong><strong>Features I would Like</strong></strong></h3>
<p>There aren’t many features that I feel are missing from Agenda, and I would be concerned if they tried to add in too much. Agenda is not a publishing platform, and in many ways isn’t a note-taking app. However, each feature is thought out so it can be adapted to many use cases. There are a couple I have mentioned already, being able to create calendar events with invites; however, I don’t even know if this is possible due to the many different calendars available. Collaboration would also be perfect, and in which case this may even become an option for teams, but just being able to write some show notes for my podcast would be great.</p>
<p>I would also like to see a focus mode, where I can write in one note. At the moment I am writing in a note that is inside the today view, or on the Agenda. It would be great to be able to open a note and no other information. With all this said, the app is pretty perfect for mine, and many other peoples use case, all the features implemented are well thought out, and the developer support is brilliant. I’m an active member of the Agenda community, so you can always come say hi!</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>It’s been a long time coming, but with the reproduction of colour into the iPhone line up with the XR, Apple released a clear case. The case has also appeared with the new phone line ups, available for the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro thanks to new colours in the lineup. Now I need to be straight to the point on this – Do Not Buy One.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to pick one up, show off that brand new Midnight-Green iPhone 11 Pro, or cool Yellow iPhone 11. If you choose to buy one in-store, you might even be pitched one to compliment your shiny new purchase, because you should show off the colour of them, the midnight green is my personal favourite, but at £45 you really shouldn’t.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="DSC0004-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/00d8675519.jpg" alt="DSC0004 1" width="600" height="600" border="0" /></p>
<p>The Apple cases are a bit like marmite, I love them because they fit and last the best I have found, but many people think they are a rip-off. Which is understandable given that most other cases are less than half the price of the stock options, but they do offer something different. The leather cases I have used last well and feel premium quality, whereas the silicone version provides a much more grippy surface. However, they charge what seems like more and more each year for the privilege.</p>
<p>The clear case feels like every other clear case on the market. The materials used are a little more robust than other clear cases, and the fit is perfect (as all ways with Apple cases). Some cheaper options are often flimsy and imperfect fitting but are a minute price when compared the Apple. What it doesn’t avoid is the same old issues that plague all clear cases – weird smudge marks and pocket lint build up.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="DSC0005-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9dd7051939.jpg" alt="DSC0005 1" width="600" height="600" border="0" /></p>
<p>To be fair almost every case in the world suffers from lint build-up, but because the case is clear, it is much more apparent. You might like showing everyone the lovely colour of your phone, but you’re also showing them you didn’t clean your phone in the last hour. When the phone is this good at avoiding fingerprints and smudges, its annoying the case isn’t – but no case can be.</p>
<p>If you are ogling to get a clear case, please don’t go for the Apple one. I made a mistake a purchased it along with a few other things and didn’t realise how expensive it is. Opt for a middle of the road option; there are plenty to choose from and save yourself some cash.</p>

      <p>Not clickbate. It’s been a great <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/one-year-of/">five years</a>, I have tried really hard to carry on as long as possible but iOS 13 has made me realise I cant continue any longer. I’m afraid friends, today was the day the end finally arrived, I’ve ditched an iPad altogether.</p><p>During my time working on the iPad I always needed a Mac around to podcast and edit things properly – you know do real work. It was pretty few and far between and during this time the iPad got better and better. Adding in a better keyboard, a pencil to write and draw as well as constantly improving the OS. My reliance on Shortcuts (then Workflow) and third party apps started to dwindle and iOS become a powerhouse – at least for a while.</p><p>Then iOS13 arrived. I cant point to one specific event or one particular bug, but iOS13 has been like death by a million paper cuts. Spending 15 minutes this morning trying to put an image into an Apple note may be the straw that broke the camels back, however the past few weeks and months have been a nightmare. Apple Notes takes an age to sync to my iPad, apps randomly crash or only partly work and I just cant take it any more.</p><p>This is all after spending weeks getting my head around the new multitasking and app pairing because they changed the way the iPad worked AGAIN. I feel like I’m splitting up with my long term partner now they have their stuff sorted and I’ve realised it wasn’t worth the pain after all. Load of people are now using the iPad like I have been doing for the past 5 years but <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/im-not-an/">I cant any longer</a>.</p><p>The iPad lost its way somewhere in the last year or so and become a device that isn’t fit for me any more. I am betraying my roots and going back to the Mac, I’ve ordered a MacBook Air and my iPad is all boxed up ready to sell.</p><p>Goodbye old friend.</p>

<p>[embed]<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=i1mVtJ4oVhQ%5B/embed%5D">youtube.com/watch</a></p>
</p>
<p>My first impressions were pretty impressed actually. I used the phone for around 4 hours and got to put it thorough all its paces, apart from battery life. That remains to be seen, but the small number of people that do have them in their packets are reporting pretty decent battery life.</p>
<p>When we first were handed the phones, the Samsung guy went into full-on PR mode. I get the impression that there have been a small number of people asking about the phone, and the company is concerned with the negative press. Which is spot on, they asked me through everything that was changed with the phone, and interestingly precisely what went wrong with the first version.</p>
<p>Having never touched the first version I can’t speak of the differences but the silver and black units I got to use were both very robustly built and are defiantly using quality materials. The weight is a little heavier than an iPhone 11 pro but considerably heavier than something like the Note 10+ I had in my pocket. The most surprising place you feel it is when it’s in your pocket, despite the slim form factor when closed you’re not going to miss this in your skinny jeans.</p>
<p>But what everyone wants to know is about that screen! I want to start on the front one; it won’t get much use. Almost everything that I tried to do was a hassle. This screen is going to be like the LCD screens on the front of flip phones. Only there to glance at and see what is worth opening your phone for.</p>
<p>You will be opening it – A lot. Because there’s no point having a folding phone and not showing it off right?</p>
<p>Samsung has added caps to the end of the hinge and made the ‘not a screen protector’ extended underneath the bezels. Combined with a few internal changes, most of the screen issues should be resolved. The hinge is tested for 200,000 actions, so should last quite a while. The problem is the tactile feedback from opening the hinge is so satisfying that I found myself playing with it quite a lot – although I’d need to do it about 280 times a day over two years to get near the limits.</p>
<p>The screen is bright crisp in all lights, you very quickly get used to its dominance, and it becomes especially useful when trying to take photos. The fold uses the same camera set up form the galaxy s10, with a wide-angle, telephone and ultra-wide lens – combined with the usually portrait effects and AR goodness you expect from Samsung.</p>
<p>Although the screen comes in handy for things like google maps and even reading webpages, its a little cumbersome for one-handed use give it has a strange 4:3 ratio. Youtube videos are particularly enjoyable, and even watchable when multitasking, but to feel the benefit you’ll need to go full screen, which features black bars on the top and bottom.</p>
<p>What you will enjoy is the Dolby Atmos audio, these sound great, particularly when enjoying videos that use great audio such as Peter McKinnon or some football highlights.</p>
<p>With all this said. This phone will spend most of its time unfolded. So you can enjoy the large screen you’ve paid so much money for. With a screen this big, it’s crying out for more use cases such as an S-Pen. Unfortunately, you can’t use one, or any other stylus for that matter. Samsung doesn’t want you to use anything on this display or even press too hard because it is plastic and not glass that most people are used to.</p>
<p>There is no getting around the crease in the middle of the screen; it is noticeable when viewing something light such as messages and lots of one UI. When the screen is off, it sticks out like a sore thumb. If you’re paying attention, you can feel it when swiping about, but I get the impression that it would become as forgettable as a natch in the screen do after a few days use.</p>
<p>There are a few quirks, such as the fingerprint sensor is separate to the power button, meaning it requires quite a bit of getting used to. And also the wireless PowerShare, which is a cool feature, is in a minimal area on the back of the handset.</p>
<p>With all said, I am very impressed with the unit overall. The £1,900 you will need to spend gets you a robust and well-built phone that feels premium. In the box, you” ll also get the Galaxy buds, and kevlar case and a year’s worth of Samsung Insurance. Which I get the feeling is an addition to combat worries on longevity.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how many people are going to buy this thing, but it’s a great phone to see on the market. If money is no object, jump on this and see the future, with a few caveats.</p>
<p>Give Samsung a couple of iterations to get things right, and I think this is going to be a stellar phone. In a few years, everything might be folding, and we will look at this space-age technology as the flip phones of old.</p>
<p>Bravo Samsung, thanks for inviting me down to take a look at the fold its defiantly a hit from me. I’m excited to see where it goes.</p>

<blockquote><p>Social media use also has an opportunity cost. If we’re at home snapping our friends on Snapchat or posting photos on Instagram, we’re not connecting with them in person. Even if we are with people in person, being heads-down on a device means that we miss out on meaningful interactions.</p></blockquote>
<p>I feel very mixed on social media, in one respect it has put me in touch with some people that I hoLd very dear in my life. People that I would never have met in ‘real life’ including my podcast co-host Nati who lives in Israel. But when I say social media I mean Twitter, because all others seem much more closed off.</p>
<p>On the other hand there is a huge amount of resentment I have towards platforms. I found myself being much less active and pretty passive now in terms of sharing things, simply because the culture at large is hugely negative when compared to a few years ago.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>I wanted t make a simple link post, but there were so many little things I wanted to pull out it just didn’t work. Jason Snell <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/opinion/iphone-deep-fusion-and-smartphone-cameras">wrote a long post for</a> Toms Guide about the incoming Deep Fusion camera technology and left me all confused.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<blockquote><p>Apple and its competitors know that smartphone buyers really do care about the camera more than anything else.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can’t agree with this, I don’t think the camera is the be all and end all for most people. It’s simply near enough the only thing that smartphones can differentiate themselves from each other. Every phone is ok, they all take photos that are good – but want to fight over who has the best niche features. I really don’t think most people that buy an iPhone 11 Pro give a dam about a little more detail in some areas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> They might buy the phone for a better camera than previous models, but they won’t jump on the bandwagon because of Deep Fusion. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>The iPhone’s Camera app is rife with little icons and stickers to indicate when a photo is being automatically cropped, when you’re grabbing Live Photo video to go with the still, and the like. And yet, at least in the iOS 13.2 beta, there’s no hint that you’re using Deep Fusion.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am a little confused still, I don’t see the point in Live Photos, I don’t feel a need for HDR the majority of the time, but here we are with a really confusing camera interface. Apple used to excel in the ability to pull your phone out and Snapp a really good photo almost instantly. Now I am bombarded with portrait modes, dark modes and even the option to make the camera 16:9.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Just do it all for me, and give me options afterwards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<blockquote><p>It gets even more interesting when you consider that some of these features are so subtle that you have to really pay attention, and make A/B comparisons, to see the difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t call it interesting – does anyone care of a jumper appears a bit more detailed. All in exchange for an image twice the storage size?</p>
<blockquote><p>but in the end, we’re all part of a culture that has fallen in love with the ability to never let a memorable life event go undocumented. Along with the ability to look up where you’ve seen that random character actor in that TV show before, it’s one of the greatest things about having a smartphone.</p></blockquote>
<p>All cameras are fine, we are obsessed with taking photos but I don’t believe it’s purely for memories.</p>

<blockquote><p>There is no doubt that the always-connected1 and accessible Android devices have enabled all these use cases.

<p>Many people seem to forget this, Android has made a whole range of devices available at a seriously cheap price. I am not sure that much of the world would be as connected as it is without Google pushing it so hard.</p>
<p>Sure they have their own agenda for doing so, but we should be thankful it exist all the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<blockquote><p>While remote SIM provisioning and a tiny secure chip are supposed to solve these problems, there’s still the issue of practicality. Checking and comparing data plans is easy enough online, but there’s currently not a good way to apply said plans quickly to your eSIM. Customers often have to pop into stores or buy eSIM packs, scan QR codes and mess around in settings menus. This is arguably more inconvenient than ordering a standard SIM.</p></blockquote>
<p>Having used an e-sim for more or less a year I can confirm its more hassle than it really should be. The real beauty of a standard sim is you can transfer it it seconds.</p>
<p>When I set up my iPhone 11 I had to pay £1.50 because I had already transferred it into an iPhone XS Max a few months before. Staff  in carrier stores are still unknowledgeable and I don’t feel it is a problem that needs ‘solving’.</p>
<p>There is a benefit to traveling, but it is not so much of a pain to buy a local sim that everything needs to built into the phone.</p>

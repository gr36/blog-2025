  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For those that are not aware, the <a href="https://gretchenrubin.com/2009/03/happiness-myth-no-8-youll-be-happy-as-soon-as-you/">arrival fallacy</a> is a psychological idea that once you get to a certain place, things will change. There’s a tendency for this to be applied to happiness and usually with purchasing things, but it can be applicable to all sorts of areas. It doesn’t have to be a specific place, it can be a certain level of money you have, and particular time or just a change in situation.</p>
<p>The overriding realisation is that when you <em>do</em> arrive at this place, nothing changes. When you achieve this mythical place, you realise that all the feelings you have angled towards it have been misplaced. No thing, feeling, or situation is going to change your outlook on life nor your position in the world.</p>
<p>Despite knowing about this fallacy for years, I still have a tendency to trick myself into believing it. My subconscious hides away my true motivations and I can become fixated on certain things to change, often non-related things. An easy to explain example is photography and gear acquisition syndrome (GAS). This is a very common thing for photographers, particularly those early in their experience.</p>
<p>GAS tricks you into thinking you need to buy an expensive camera, or high-priced lenses because then you will be able to take great photos. “Just like the people that use it do” you whisper to yourself clicking the buy button, when in fact you should just be out shooting and learning. I had this bad until I <a href="/2022/06/01/keep-it-simple.html">stripped everything back</a> and changed my outlook.</p>
<p>I do this with all sorts of things. <a href="/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html">Notebooks</a> weirdly are my current obsession, and they are all the same right, but that doesn’t stop my brain from fooling me. Convincing me that I need to order this one and that one. What exactly am I going to do then? <a href="/2023/02/11/do-i-even.html">Write more notes</a>? There’s no arrival, there’s no trick to getting to the places you want to be. Like a children’s story, the magic is in you all along.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>You don’t have to tell Me how popular Field Notes are. I buy enough of the to keep the company in business on our own. This has built up over time due to their simple yet elegant design, functionality, and affordability. Not only are they perfect for jotting down notes, ideas, plans, and important information, but they also make great gifts for the stationery lovers in our lives.</p>
<p>Their pocket-sized notebooks are perfect for carrying around, whether it be to a meeting, class, work, or lunch. Their colourful covers make them instantly recognisable, and the fact that they come with helpful features like a ruler and page marker means that they are practical and versatile.</p>
<p>Moreover, their recycled materials and recycled paper option make them both environment-friendly and cost-efficient. They are made by people that really care, making sure they produce the best possible quality at a reasonable price. With each purchase, you are getting not just a purchase to last, but that warm fuzzy feeling that they are made ethically and responsibly.</p>
<p>Field Notes co-founder Aaron Draplin has been collecting memo books for years, and recognises the importance of a pocket notebook. He has his team have created a company that has captured the hearts of Field nuts like us by concentrating on prosecuting great products. See their ‘From Seed’ video below.</p>

<p>The wide range of options allows you to find the perfect notebook for your needs; from the classic notebook to the specialty journals and planners, there is something for everyone.

<p>Overall, Field Notes Notebooks are an excellent choice for those who are looking for a simple, stylish, and affordable notebook. With so many great features, it’s no wonder these notebooks have become so popular – and with good reason!</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>This app is niche. It only works for micro.blog so all of these words I write will only be applicable to a tiny section of readers – but that doesn’t stop this app being great. It really is the perfect micro.blog app and adds in lots of little features to make the experience much better.</p>
<p>Developed by <a href="https://vincentritter.com/">Vincent Ritter</a>, one of the developers working on the micro.blog platform, <a href="https://gluon.app/">Gluon</a> ads on top of the service in so many useful ways. He uses his opinionated but thoughtful skills to craft a whole range of services, such as <a href="https://sublimeads.com/">Sublime adds</a> and <a href="https://shoutouts.lol/">Shoutouts,</a> meaning Gluon is no exception.</p>
<p>What Vincent has done is add in features that really help users of micro.blog out. By listening to the community, he’s able to not only work on the service as a whole, but also build an app to service its users. Features such as customising the way the timeline looks with colours and fonts used mean that you can really make the app yours.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1c45b59161.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Two big features really stand out though. Gluon adds in the ability to mute keywords and I couldn’t be happier. I have struggled with the option to filter out things, particularly American politics, right from the start. An issue that was further exacerbated by being able to follow Mastodon accounts. With Gluon, there’s no more politics in my timeline, nor endless posts about Twitter. Whatever it is that you would rather not see, Gluon powerfully filters out these posts and makes it a much better place to be.</p>
<p>Secondly, Gluon can reply to all. You don’t realise you even need this option until you are involved in an interesting discussion. You are stuck going backwards and forwards copying usernames, whereas Gluon does it all for you. With the added option of removing people from the reply. Sounds so simple doesn’t it, but it’s so helpful.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/71ecc156ea.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Gluon also has all the expected features like the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/micro-blog/id1253201335">official app</a>, but with much more customisation. The controls and navigation of the apps are intuitive and well thought through. The simple interface allows you to reply or see the conversation by swiping the post, and four tabs at the bottom get you to the places you need to go.</p>
<p>There’s something about Gluon that I really enjoy using, and although the 3.0 update of the official app looks great, Vincent’s app seems to be constantly improving. It makes the micro.blog experience much better for me, and I really appreciate its development.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Whenever I am ready to start a new notebook, I get scared. Particularly if it is a nice one. I do this dance with myself where I make excuses not to start it because I would rather not ruin it. Of course, I do eventually start writing in it, and within a very short time it is battered and bruised like all my other ones. Doing its important work until the cycle starts again.</p>
<p>I love notebooks. I always have, even before I was a <a href="/2023/02/11/do-i-even.html">serial notetaker</a>, I loved the idea of having loads of stationary and filing it up with thoughts and ideas. This hardly ever became reality because I never knew what to write to give this delightful new notebook the excellent content it deserved. My hand writing sucks after years of typing everything up in academia and publishing explosively online. Seriously, it’s embarrassing.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e83a925afa.jpg" alt="My current battered Moleskine Cashire after only a few weeks use." title="My current battered Moleskine Cashire after only a few weeks use."></p>
<p>These feelings of dread are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooks/comments/2dernj/i_have_the_new_notebook_dont_want_to_ruin_it/">not exclusive to me</a>. I read numerous posts about people spending money on notebooks and not knowing what to write in them. <a href="/2022/12/31/i-really-want.html">Worrying about making the perfect Bullet Journal</a> setup (me), or wanting to supplement their notes with cute little doodles but not actually being able to draw (also me). When the only thing you can do it ruin it, and do it the justice it deserves.</p>
<p>Matt Christey <a href="https://medium.com/writers-blokke/deliberately-ruin-a-page-of-your-new-notebook-cf2c36becc8a">shares these feelings</a>, with a bit of animosity mixed in. “I hate new notebooks. They’re too perfect. Especially when the paper is nice” he says before systematically ruining a page of every new notebook he buys. By creating one intentional fuck up, this allows him the space to fill the rest of the pages with things that might not work, but won&rsquo;t be as bad as the ruined page.</p>
<p>Starting a new notebook is a bit like standing on the edge of doing something dangerous. There’s a mixture of “I better not mess this up” with a realisation that you actually need to use this thing. As I said the only thing to do is get on a ruin it. A new notebook is made to be used and abused by its owner, otherwise what’s the point?</p>

      <p>This question is one of the most common searched for terms and also asked in various ways all over social media. It’s an understandable one, people are fascinated by their dedicated fans.

<p>Numerous people really enjoy using analogue things, with the use of more tactile products <a href="https://youtu.be/art9LGB16FA">increasing year over year</a>. As such, the way Field Notes acts and feels is critical, and many people agree their quality is great.</p>
<p>This <em>is</em> subjective. Many other brands such as Moleskin have excellent paper too. However, quality often comes out near the top of reasons people like Field Notes notebooks. Their paper is thicker, whiter and nicer to touch than many others.</p>
<h2 id="limited-editions">Limited Editions</h2>
<p>People love to collect things, and Field Notes produce quarterly editions that are limited. They feature an entire range of things including Great Lakes and National parks, as well as often being bright and bold.</p>
<p>Once they run out, they are never printed again and people love that they own a small piece of history and often keep them stored away. You can now even <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/limited-editions">subscribe</a> to make sure you get all the quarterly editions straight to your door.</p>
<p>&lt; bookmark most popular subscriptions &gt;</p>
<h2 id="the-brand">The Brand</h2>
<p>Field Notes have built a brand that people respect and admire. They are not a huge, all encompassing conglomerate, they care about what they make and the people who use them. Often creating editions that <a href="https://fieldnuts.co.uk/a-new-bird-in-town/">give to organisations</a> and events, as well as reflecting a caring personality.</p>
<p>People like Field Notes because the brand represents who they are as a person. The brand works hard to create a look that feels nice and people love that.</p>
<h2 id="innovation">Innovation</h2>
<p>Not often big on the list of a company that makes paper notebooks (and a few other things) but they have often pushed things forward. Editions like the <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/expedition">Expedition</a>, which is almost indestructible, show the care, thought and investment that goes into marking Field Notes notebooks.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Field Notes have built up not just a brand that people love, but a quality product that is worth the investment. They usually cost a little more, but really put the effort into creating a product that people rely on. Many people like Field Notes notebooks and simply wouldn’t use anything else.</p>

      <p>Om Malik <a href="https://om.co/2022/12/09/why-context-matters/">writing about context</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try and find the context. Wherever you can ask as many questions and may slow you down in being able to make a decision that may slow you down and being able to form a take, but maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe we shouldn’t have an opinion immediately. Maybe we should wait and see what happened. See what the context is.</p></blockquote>
<p>The amount of times that I’ve mediated a disagreement that is purely because of the failure to understand the context is far too many. Especially when everything nowadays seems to be written down, the context of the words read can be wildly different than the ones written.</p>
<p>I am not sure what the cause is, but there seems to be a distinct lack of understanding that other people might not think and act like you do. There’s definitely some <a href="https://www.cxomedia.id/human-stories/20220722170529-74-175667/get-to-know-main-character-syndrome">main character</a> delusion going on in the modern world and people can’t see the context and instead seem to look for the argument instead.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When all is said and done, I am not a very good writer. I’m a consistent one, a passionate one, and I’m much better than I used to be. I am still not good at it when compared to people that have spent time crafting their art. That have spent time learning the ways of writing and growing their vocabulary to communicate with ease.</p>
<p>The truth is that anyone can write something passable with enough time to do it, but it takes years to do it well. This is one of the reasons that AI tools like ChatGPT can engineer some words on a page, but can’t communicate the point clearly and passionately. They are pulling in words that have already been written, working out which ones most likely go together given the subject, and churning it out. It gets it right most of the time, but will never fully replace a gifted writer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When students arrive in college, they don’t see writing as a medium of communication … They see it as sort of this engineering task that they’re then going to present to us as examiner and hopefully have us say, ‘Yeah, you did it right.</p></blockquote>
<p>Above is a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/writing-education-language-empathy-ai-chatgpt-age/672999/">quote</a> by English professor Jim Warren, who teaches writing at the University of Texas. This quote sums up perfectly what most people think writing is, a sort of puzzle that can be solved by just placing the right words in the right order. Which indeed it is, in the same way beautiful music is just the right notes in the right order.</p>
<p>It might be technically correct (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/chatgpt-amazing-wrong">it also might not be</a>) and covering all the basic points, but anything produced by the current level of AI tools is hard work. It is often painful, repetitive, and boring. Don’t get me wrong, this could just be a matter of time and computing power, but something tells me that good writers will never be replaced. As I’ve <a href="/2023/02/10/the-next-generation.html">written about previously</a>, creative work is about to be changed forever, but many of the work that is due to be replaced can’t be engineered.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Have you ever wanted to choose between two quality pocket notebooks, but were unsure of which one to go with? <a href="https://www.moleskine.com/en-gb/">Moleskine</a> Cahier and <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com">Field Notes</a> are some of the best notebooks in the market, but which one should you go for? In this blog post, I will go through all the details, so you can make an informed decision when it comes to Moleskine vs Field Notes.</p>
<p>Both Moleskine and Field Notes are great choices when it comes to notebooks, and they are some of the most popular options out there. They have their similarities, such as their well-made nature, as well as their differences. Moleskine offers a wide variety of sizes, while Field Notes only makes pocket-sized notebooks. Moleskine&rsquo;s covers come in hard, soft, and cardboard, and it has a few types of paper, whereas Field Notes has only one type of cover and different types of paper.</p>
<p>When it comes to size, Moleskine offers many more size options and is the better choice for those looking for larger notebooks. We use may of them here in our writing cave. Moleskin <em>do</em> sell a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cahier-Plain-Pocket-Journal-Black/dp/8883704916/">small version Cashier</a>, which most people compare to Field Notes. The single, pocket-size option, is perfect for those who need something to fit in their pocket.</p>
<p>As for covers, Moleskine offers three main cover options: hard, soft, and cardboard. These are usually sold in block, but particularly with the pocket sized version they do come in blue and a cardboard style brown. If you forget about special editions, Field Notes offers only one basic cover, a light brown cardboard cover similar to a brown paper bag. For a little more money, you can buy Field Notes with in special edition covers, which is what most people really value in the brand.</p>
<p>Both brands have great paper quality and work perfectly with ballpoint pens and pencils, although Moleskine&rsquo;s paper is a bit yellow and Field Notes&rsquo; more white.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something with more variety, Moleskine is the right choice for you. But if you need something that&rsquo;s small and flexible, <a href="https://www.thejournalshop.com/collections/field-notes">Field Notes</a> is your best option. So, when it comes to choosing between Moleskine and Field Notes, it all comes down to what you require in a notebook and what both companies can offer you. Consider the size, covers, and paper types to find out which one suits your needs the best.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/02/11/do-i-even.html"><h1 class="p-name">Do I Even Want To Take Notes?</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’ve started and failed to make notes like I’m told to do by all the productivity content creators out there. It was first Roam Research, then Obsidian (more than once) and most recently Apple Notes. I could never quite put my finger on why because in the few weeks I do manage to keep it up, it really helps.</p>
<p>In the book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781529396508">Happy, Sexy, Millionaire</a> Steven Bartlett discusses his colleague Sophie. She’s a serial gym starter, except she never gets there, she just endlessly talks about going and never goes. As Steven soon concludes, that’s because she doesn’t really want to go to the gym, she wants to be the type of person that goes to the gym. She likes the thought of being fit and healthy, but doesn’t actually want to put in the hard work.</p>
<p>Bringing this back to my serial note-taking thoughts. Do I actually want to take notes to help my creative flow? Or do I in fact just want to appear as the type of person that carries around a notebook. An example that people talk about when they discuss note-taking or people that <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">journal</a>. Is my ego the driving force here instead of my motivation to improve my life?</p>
<p>There’s an important distinction to make here. Because I am certainly not <em>really</em> motivated to <a href="/2020/08/09/i-cant-go.html">ditch my smartphone</a>, but my ego wants me to be the type of person that doesn’t have one. For it to be a personality trait that might make me a bit more interesting than I actually am. The motivation to do things is a strange and often mysterious thing to work out. One that strangely I have come to realise through journaling and being more aware of my thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>There are numerous things that I want to do for one reason or another, but many that don’t stick around very long. Perseverance only goes so far, even when you are really motivated. The underlying root of those things remains important so as not to waste time or effort, but some things are worth the effort.</p>

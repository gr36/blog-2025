  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For far too long, we’ve had <a href="/2019/11/20/how-i-use.html">far too many meetings</a> of professionals involved in <a href="/2022/08/28/im-proud-of.html">my daughter&rsquo;s</a> care. She needs numerous medical appointments, but we also waste a lot of time talking about the things they think she needs. We spend even more time talking about what the rest of the family requires, especially myself and my wife.</p>
<p>They call us many nice things. Tell us that we require help and support, and then some more charming things. It&rsquo;s all very pleasant. The reality is that, in their professional opinion, we can’t continue the way we do with little to no social care and compare us to other families in similar situations.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bfe4316d5c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I am used to this by now. For many years, I have heard how we do “an amazing job” and that it “must be so hard” with what we go through. Which is lovely, but the truth is we know no other way. Lucie was our first child, so we’ve not experienced anything else. When others tell me I do more than I should, and that the situation we are in is hard, I get confused.</p>
<p>The words of Zen teacher Charlotte Joko Beck in <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781916290303">Death: The End of Self-Improvement</a> always rattle around my head.“it’s only unbearable for as long as you’re under the impression that there might be a cure” is the best explication for our continued ambivalence towards change. Nothing will ever improve, there is no end to the way our life is, so there’s nothing to lust after.</p>
<p>Perhaps if we had experienced a different life first, our outlook would be different? A friend of mine who has cereal palsy explained a similar thing to me when talking about his world view. He’s managed to achieve a lot in life and run his own business with a positive mindset because he’s lived with difficulty since birth. Individuals that have not experienced the same and have their life changed through an accident or illness often do not share the same mindset.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with asking for help, that is not the point I am reaching for. It’s more to say that the way I view things is directly related to my experience in life so far. Situations that others may perceive as hard or difficult do not seem so bad to me – mainly because there is some comfort in knowing that there’s no solution possible.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>As much as I share my own, I generally don’t have any interest in other people&rsquo;s lives. This appears to be strange in modern life, as many others consume other lives as entertainment, either on TV or social media. I typically have enough to worry about on my own without looking at anyone else’s. I look upon it in the same terms as the phrase used in relation to prison sentences of “doing your own time” and not letting the people around you affect your life too much.</p>
<p>I do take note of the world around me though, and often find the little snippets of conversation overheard fascinating. It offers a little peek into what other people are experiencing, although I am sure one that is completely out of context. When sat in a coffee shop, or waiting in line, I frequently catch little glimpses into other people&rsquo;s thoughts and I enjoy taking in other view points on things. Finding out what others experience or are talking about is important to understand where your thoughts are.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6dcb89faab.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It is easy in these instances to make judgements about people. To overhear their worries and fears, and regularly their arguments, and then make decisions about them as a person. To become judgemental and look down on them or view them as wrong. You overhear discussions and arguments that often affect your opinion on people that you haven’t even met. Viewing your life as better. On the other side, if you believe social media, everyone&rsquo;s life looks better than ours because we are comparing <a href="/2021/05/31/insides-vs-outsides.html">insides to outsides</a>.</p>
<p>What glimpsing into other lives does to me is make me thankful of the life I have. Grateful that I do not have to go through other people&rsquo;s experiences, and be appreciative of the things I have. As Lucy Lord <a href="https://www.rte.ie/lifestyle/living/2020/1224/1185962-extract-not-a-life-coach-by-james-smith/">said,</a> “If we could all put our problems into one big pile, we’d take our own problems back every single time”. It&rsquo;s easy to view others through a lens or in a snapshot and decide on our own lives, but when we take a step back and see the reality of our world, we realise how lucky we are.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>As a Field Notes user, one of the biggest questions I had before investing in a Midori Passport was whether or not my beloved pocket notebooks would fit inside. After doing some research and trying it out for myself, here&rsquo;s what I found.</p>
<p>First things first, the Midori Passport is designed to hold inserts that measure 4.5 x 3.5 inches. This is a bit smaller than the standard Field Notes size of 5.5 x 3.5 inches. However, with a little bit of creativity, it is definitely possible to make it work.</p>
<p>One option is to trim down your Field Notes to fit inside the Midori Passport. This can easily be done with a paper cutter or even just a pair of scissors. While this may seem like a hassle, it&rsquo;s actually a great way to repurpose partially used notebooks or to create custom inserts that fit your specific needs. You can trim the Field Notes to the exact size of the Midori Passport inserts or leave a little bit of space around the edges, depending on your preference.</p>
<p>Another option is to use a Field Notes cover specifically designed to fit inside a Midori Passport. There are a variety of handmade leather and fabric covers available on sites like Etsy that will keep your Field Notes protected while also fitting perfectly inside your Midori Passport. These covers are not only functional but also add a personal touch to your notebook system.</p>
<p>If you are not keen on trimming or buying a cover, you can always just slip your Field Notes inside the Midori Passport without any extra protection. While this may leave your notebooks a bit more exposed to wear and tear, it&rsquo;s a great option for those who want to keep things simple and streamlined. However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the Midori Passport&rsquo;s elastic closure may not be as tight around the Field Notes, which could potentially lead to some pages falling out.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while Field Notes may not fit perfectly inside a Midori Passport, there are definitely ways to make it work. Whether you choose to trim them down, invest in a cover, or leave them unprotected, the combination of these two popular products is definitely worth considering for any pocket notebook enthusiast. With a little bit of customisation, you can create a notebook system that is both functional and personalised to your specific needs.</p>

Then look no further than a Field Notes <a href="/2023/03/12/what-is-my.html">notebook</a>! These notebooks are the perfect size for on-the-go journaling and can fit easily into your pocket or bag.</p>
<h2 id="why-journaling-is-important">Why Journaling is Important</h2>
<p><a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">Journaling</a> has been shown to have a range of benefits, from reducing stress and anxiety to improving overall mental health. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process and make sense of them, and can provide a sense of clarity and perspective. Additionally, by documenting your experiences, you can look back and reflect on your personal growth and progress over time.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-the-right-field-notes">Choosing the Right Field Notes</h2>
<p>There are a variety of Field Notes notebooks available, each with its own unique cover design and paper style. Consider which one will best suit your needs. If you intend to use a lot of ink or watercolour in your journal, then the Expedition or Waterproof edition may be the best choice. If you prefer a classic look and feel, then the Original Kraft edition may be perfect for you.</p>
<h2 id="setting-a-routine">Setting a Routine</h2>
<p>To get the most out of your journaling experience, set aside a specific time each day to write in your Field Notes notebook. This will help you establish a routine and make journaling a regular habit. Whether it&rsquo;s first thing in the morning, during your lunch break, or before bed, find a time that works best for you.</p>
<h2 id="using-prompts">Using Prompts</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling to come up with something to write about, try using prompts. There are plenty of prompt books available, or you can do a quick internet search for journal prompts. Alternatively, you could write about your day or reflect on a recent experience.</p>
<h2 id="getting-creative">Getting Creative</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to get creative with your journaling. Use different coloured pens or markers, add stickers or washi tape, or include sketches or doodles. This will make your journal more visually interesting and engaging.</p>
<h2 id="reflecting-on-your-progress">Reflecting on Your Progress</h2>
<p>Every few weeks, take some time to reflect on your journaling progress. Look back at what you&rsquo;ve written and reflect on any patterns or themes that have emerged. This will help you better understand yourself and your experiences.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-using-a-field-notes-notebook">The Benefits of Using a Field Notes Notebook</h2>
<p>Aside from the convenience and portability of Field Notes notebooks, using them as a journal also has a range of benefits. The small size of the notebooks can help you focus on the most important aspects of your day, while the limited space can encourage you to write more concisely and with greater intention. Additionally, the unique cover designs and paper styles of Field Notes notebooks can add a personal touch to your journaling experience.</p>
<p>Given it small size and excellent quality, I think that using a Field Notes notebook as a journal is a great way to document your thoughts, ideas, and experiences. By choosing the right notebook, setting a routine, using prompts, getting creative, and reflecting on your progress, you can make the most out of your field notes journaling experience. Happy writing!</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>My son and I spend a not insignificant amount of time at <a href="/2022/07/17/ninja-warrior.html">Ninja Warrior assault courses</a>. After our first exploration to the one in Sheffield, we found one in Leicester we really like and go fairly regularly for an hour or two to challenge ourselves. This is our fun time together. On our last visit, James was very disheartened that he couldn’t <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDi9H--408A">“beat the wall”</a> on the adult course.</p>
<p>“I still can’t get up there dad” he said whilst we grabbed a drink. Making him think twice about trying again. I <strong>could</strong> tell him that it’s a long way up, he’s only small still, and all sorts of comforting things. However, I said the only thing that should be said in this situation and that is, don’t look at what you can’t do yet, look at how far you’ve come.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/aeb670a5a5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When we first went, neither of us were anywhere near getting through half of the obstacles, never mind about beating the wall. Only a few months later, he’s swinging from things, darting up cargo nets and has improved his balance and co-ordination no end. That&rsquo;s not enough for us humans, though, our negativity bias focuses on the wrong things. Fixated on what we are still yet to do, instead of what’s already been done.</p>
<p>There is no better example of this than my task list at work. It’s constantly filled with things I need to do. Like the heads of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra">hydra</a>, and as soon as I check one off, there is at least another to take its place. Which is fine, until a certain point where you realise you’re on a treadmill with no escape. It starts to feel a bit overwhelming and often leads to a lack of motivation. Pretty quickly, life could become untenable.</p>
<p>So let’s flip the thinking here. Instead of looking at the outstanding tasks, let’s look at the ones already checked off. Focus on a done list rather than a to-do list. Any time I feel a bit overwhelmed by what’s on my plate, not only do I remember there will <a href="/2023/01/30/there-will-always.html">always be more work</a>, but also flip through <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">my Bullet Journal</a> and look at all the crossed off items.</p>
<p>From there, it’s pretty easy to frame this into a remarkable achievement, rather than a stressful nightmare.</p>

      <p>I have a <a href="https://micro.blog/numericcitizen/16030689">running joke</a> with <a href="https://micro.blog/numericcitizen">JFM</a> about him having about 3 thousand different blogs. It is very much tongue in cheek because it works for him, but the thought of worrying <a href="gregmorris.co.uk/2021/02/13/where-does-this.html">about where a post goes</a> is not something I want to deal with. I’ve written about the freeing feeling of having <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2021/03/28/why-microblog.html">one blog before</a>, but this path of the least resistance seems to be a universal law to help with almost everything.</p>
<p>There is something to be said about <a href="gregmorris.co.uk/2019/12/17/intentional-barriers.html">intentional barriers</a> in the way of actions you would like to reduce, but for everything else, the easiest path is the way. As Ryder Carol, the inventor of the bullet journal, <a href="https://youtu.be/DZVaVav8lGo">put it,</a> “the more apps, the more gaps”. James Clear, writer of Atomic Habits, also defaults <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2r1jyhT2vg">to one place</a> to store everything. Otherwise, your system falls down due to the need to remember where you saved it in the first place. Defeating the whole point.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter where that place is, but having things spread into multiple areas, or constantly moving them, is just a waste of time and effort. When I think about the amount of time I wasted looking at new <a href="gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/02/writing-instead-of.html">note-taking</a>, <a href="gregmorris.co.uk/2021/03/19/looking-for-my.html">writing</a> and task management apps, I shudder a little. My, and numerous others I see, constant need to look for something ‘better’ costs us dearly.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e3e8f62041.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If truth be told, I could never find one digital place that ticked all my boxes. Instead of remembering the information, I had to remember where I put it. So to cut out all the wasted energy overcoming the resistance in my system, I reverted to perhaps the oldest tool known to man – a writing instrument, and somewhere to use it.</p>
<p>All the resistance is now gone because the only answer is in <a href="gregmorris.co.uk/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html">my notebook</a>. Not only am I not worrying where to put things, but I also know where everything is, I can flick through my notebook and find the note I made with relative ease. My concern over previously being able to search digital notes has dissipated because I remember more of them anyway. The act of writing everything down and being able to read through them at any point means my recall is much higher.</p>
<p>It doesn’t really matter where <strong>your</strong> place is, but by having one place, you are doing yourself a favour. Reducing your cognitive load and giving yourself the best chance at achieving your desired goal. It might be getting tasks checked off, it might be saving ideas, or it might just be the occasional scribble. Take the right path and choose one with the least resistance. You’ll thank yourself for it.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780374159122">Four Thousand Weeks</a> by Oliver Burkeman 📚</p>
<p>This is one of the most life changing books I have read in a while. It has given me a new way of not just looking at my work, but also life itself.</p>
<h2 id="meaningful-highlights">Meaningful Highlights</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>good luck finding a time management system that makes any room for engaging productively with your fellow citizens, with current events, or with the fate of the environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is an &lsquo;anti hustle culture&rsquo; uprising going on at the moment. All of a sudden people are realising that we do not need to hustle through the best years of our lives and not leave room for things that make us happy. After all what is the point in living if not enjoying it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Productivity is a trap. Becoming more efficient just makes you more rushed, and trying to clear the decks simply makes them fill up again faster.</p></blockquote>
<p>There will always be more work. If you live in a capitalist society and you work for a company that holds the notion they are forced to grow, you are always screwed. Companies expect more and more from their workers, and getting towards the end of your list only leads to more tasks. It is only when you realise that you can only get done what you can the real freedom comes.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no point stressing about getting to the end because modern life is a treadmill you can never get off. Much like inbox zero only leads to more emails, all the modern productivity punchlines just lead to more work. By embracing the fact that the end will never arrive, you can relax, knock as many tasks off as you can and get some downtime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in attempting to eliminate only the tedious experiences, we accidentally end up eliminating things we didn’t realise we valued until they were gone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people must feel as I do that resting and doing atelic tasks are a &lsquo;waste of time&rsquo;. We are encouraged to squeeze every moment for the most return. A return on a later date that may never arrive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where’s the logic in constantly postponing fulfilment until some later point in time when soon enough you won’t have any ‘later’ left?</p></blockquote>
<p>Using your time wisely is the best thing to do. But constantly using it for the benefit of the future is like a hoarder. Keeping everything just incase. The very definition of the word ‘purposiveness’ (using time well for future purposes) but never actually using it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By trying too hard to make the most of his time, he misses his life.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>there’s usually the unspoken fantasy that you might one day finally reach the state of having no problems whatsoever.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find some peoples lives as if they are living a [[Provisional Life]] as if they are preparing for the one that comes next by doing all of these things. Confucius says “We have two lives, and the second begins when we realise we only have one.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zen teacher Charlotte Joko Beck puts it, it’s only unbearable for as long as you’re under the impression that there might be a cure.</p></blockquote>
<p>I like this a lot to our struggles with Luice care. There is not solution or magic bullet to fix it, so there is no point fooling ourselves that anything is ever going to change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The original Latin word for ‘decide’, decidere, means ‘to cut off’, as in slicing away alternatives; it’s a close cousin of words like ‘homicide’ and ‘suicide’.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is why deciding feels painful sometimes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It didn’t take Brown long to figure out that their pulsing sense of urgency was a form of self-medication – something they were doing as a way not to feel something else.</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote from psychotherapist Stephanie Brown who had a practice in Silicon Valley on the 90&rsquo;s hit me hard. Not being able to sit still and rest or enjoy a basic activity is a defence mechanism against being alone with yourself. This is an addict self medicating by distracting instead of intoxicating themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>keep a ‘done list’,</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no better example of this than my task list at work. It is constantly filled with things I need to do. Like the heads of a hydra, as soon as I check one off, there is at least another to take its place. Which is fine, until a certain point where you realise you&rsquo;re on a treadmill with no escape. It starts to feel a bit overwhelming and often leads to a lack of motivation. Pretty quickly, life could become untenable.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s flip the thinking here. Instead of looking at the outstanding tasks, let’s look at the ones already checked off. Focus on a done list rather than a to-do list. Any time I feel a bit overwhelmed by what’s on my plate, not only do I remember there will <a href="/2023/01/30/there-will-always.html">always be more work</a>, but also flip through <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">my Bullet Journal</a> and look at all the crossed off items.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>A few weeks ago a read a post on Mastodon which in essence claimed you can’t do anything on a 256gb MacBook. Ha, I thought. I’m going to teach this person a lesson because I run the design department of my company on a 256gb MacBook Pro. Yet instead I just wrote about it in my journal and carried on with my life.</p>
<p>The truth is you don’t actually need a lot saved on your hard drive, especially in our modern world of Wi-Fi, and external storage options – but I digress.</p>
<p>My initial reaction was to dive in. Make a scene and put my point across. Which seems to be a typical human trait, believing that everyone needs to hear your perspective. We have a tendency to only appreciate the world from our angle. To frame everything with our life experience and give our option thusly. When in reality, no matter how much life experience we’ve had, we have very limited knowledge of the world.</p>
<p>Our ego leads us to believe that the way we see the world is correct. In fact, we need to also press that experience and opinion on everyone who has an opposing view. We suffer from what is referred to on social media as ’main character syndrome’. To believe that we have an over inflated self-importance in the world than we actually do.</p>
<p>To quote the title of the first epic novel by J. Truant “The Universe Doesn&rsquo;t Give a Flying Fuck About You”. The reality is, neither should you. Let’s go all the way back to my example, I have no clue what the person making claims about MacBook HD sizes needs it to do. Maybe they can’t do anything with 256gb of space, but that doesn’t mean I have to tell them off.</p>
<p>Instead, I can just go on with my day and forget about it. The only reason wild generic statements like that feel offensive is because of you. Your ego is fooling you into thinking you need to prove them wrong. When your opinion doesn’t matter to anyone but yourself.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/02/24/for-the-enjoyment.html"><h1 class="p-name">For The Enjoyment Of It</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about some of the things I do and understanding my motivations. I am uncertain if this is because I am nearing 40 and having some kind of crisis. Or that I have recently read 4,000 weeks, but I want to make sure I am getting the most out of the things that I do. Prioritising activities that I enjoy and being more intentional with my time.</p>
<p>Despite having two children to look after, a company to help run, and a whole range of relationships to manage, my life is packed full of activities. Both myself and my wife <a href="/2019/11/20/how-i-use.html">live out of our calendars</a> whilst still maintaining time for our relationship. Enjoyment of our lives is at the centre of everything we do with our kids, so we like to think about the things I do, too.</p>
<p>I stated of course with writing because I do a great deal of it. Not just on my blog, but for my job, <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">for my life</a> and also just because I enjoy it. Either manual scribbling or typing on my keyboard, I love writing. The question always exists of “what is it for”. I scribbled it in my notebook a couple of weeks ago whilst <a href="/2023/02/12/not-sure-if.html">musing other things</a> and tried to come to some kind of resolution on why.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3ae518807f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I am sure you will be saying in your head, “but Greg, you write because you enjoy writing”. Unfortunately, if you’ve read any of my previous posts, you may be able to already expect that a tautology is not good enough for me. I like to question things, and understand myself on deeper levels. When questions arise in my mind, I like to have some kind of reasoning to satisfy the curiosity I have about myself.</p>
<p>I make no money from writing. I don’t do it for clicks, although I do love the interaction it sometimes brings. Nor am I interested in any kind of sudo fame that some bloggers manage to achieve. Indeed, my motivation for writing is completely internal, if my intentions were to gain anything from it externally, then I would have put more effort into actually crafting the art and strengthening my skill by now.</p>
<p>Philosopher Kieran Setiya <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781400888474">refers to atelic activity</a> as one that its value is not derived from its ultimate aim (telos). This is a label that could, without doubt, be applied to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk">my photography</a>. I don’t go out with my camera to provide a result, I do it to see the world differently and enjoy the process. The photographs that are produced are a byproduct of the enjoyment I get from it. Although that <a href="/2022/10/03/taking-the-shot.html">hasn’t always been the case</a> for me.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bed509c085.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>These thoughts gave me some reasoning around simply enjoying the process of writing instead of the result. I love writing out my thoughts and that is enough motivation to do it. Although enough of it takes place in private that hitting publish barely seems worth it at all, the process could be enough. However, much like the photos that make it to the end of my photography process, some enjoyment comes from ‘working in public’. Not for a kind of return, purely to share some of <em>my</em> enjoyment with others.</p>
<p>Dazné <a href="https://dazne.net/make/">summed this up</a> more succinctly than I. “I write foremost for myself. And when others find it useful, then that’s great too”. This <strong>whole post</strong> is me, coming to terms to with my mortality and wanting to understand myself better. If by doing this in public, with a typo ridden blog post, perhaps helps someone else than that&rsquo;s great – but it&rsquo;s not the motivation behind it.</p>
<p>This process has been helped along by what I read, both in books and online, and my reading list has a strange way of surfacing thoughts just when I need them. If my posts do that for someone else and help them understand the world or themselves, then all the better.</p>

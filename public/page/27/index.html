  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’ve started reading Jason Sinek book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780241958230">Start With Why</a> and like most books of this ilk it’s tough getting through all the repetitive cherry peaked examples and struggles to get to the point. It suffers from the modern problem of a book that could and should have been a blog post.</p>
<p>The idea it covers do help with loss of things though. It talks through the importance of communicating why you do something or why you have created the things you do, first. It does this in a very business centric way, it’s a business book after all, but it also applies to everything you want to do, even if you are communicating it just to yourself. Something I started thinking about it after watching a <a href="https://youtu.be/inPnvN6PyLg?t=126">Maurice Moves video</a> a few months ago.</p>
<p>In it, he discusses the things he writes in his notebook and a few tips about productivity – sounds like my kind of video doesn’t it! However, it is very different from most others about this subject. He plans everything in his notebook, including his desires and motivations, and by writing these out he gains a new perspective.</p>
<p>By being clear about the ‘why’ of what he wants to achieve, he quite often finds that the ‘what’, or the results, he would like to achieve is not always what he defines at the start. Sound confusing, let’s look at his example.</p>
<p>He started his YouTube channel, wishing to get to 1 million subscribers. When asking himself why he wanted this goal, it was so he could monetise his videos well and earn enough money for this to become his ‘job’. By clearly defining the ‘what’ and validating this through asking ‘why’ he discovered that the perceived result of wanting subscribers, is actually a symptom of the actual desired result. The actually desired result was creating enough revenue to live from, which has nothing to do with channel earnings, it is merely a symptom.</p>
<p>As Alan De Botton puts it “it’s bad enough not getting what you want, but it’s even worse getting to the end and realising it isn’t what you wanted all along”. Don’t fall into this trap and start asking why, to <strong>everything</strong>.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It has taken me decades on this earth to realise that I need to spend more time processing the trauma that I experienced. No one did anything bad to me or anything, but I think everyone has this period when growing up where you realise that life in the real-world hurts quite a bit. It&rsquo;s a natural progression, and the worst thing you can do is run away from it.</p>
<p>This isn’t a sob story, but the fact is my parents were not very nice to me. One left when I was a baby, and I have seen a handful of times since. The other may as well have left because they threw themselves into working and ‘providing’ that the distance between us was insurmountable. I was effectively raised by my Grandparents, particularly my grandfather, and both of them are no longer with us.</p>
<p>I think everyone has some kind of tale to tell about their childhood. You can come from the nicest, most caring family in the world, but you will have something that stands out in those myriad of great experiences that shaped you into the person you became. The people who deal with it the best are the ones that face it, deal with it and move on – I did no such thing. I self-medicated.</p>
<p>Not in the literal sense. The masking of these sots of issues can come in many forms, and inebriating yourself is only one of them – if admittedly and very popular one. If you look at the currently emerging generation, they are choosing to hide away from the world and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/21/opinion/teen-youth-focus-group.html">live out as much of it online instead</a>. To Self medicate their worries and fears by hiding behind anonymity and block lists with the goal, as Freddie deBoer <a href="https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/you-are-you-we-live-here-this-is">put it</a>, to live out in infancy forever.</p>
<p>I decided to self-medicate myself with busyness instead. To constantly be working on something and make sure I spend as little time as possible with myself. If worrying about doing something was an olympic sport, I would be up there with the best. I couldn’t sit still, I had to be something and to prove to everyone, and me, that I <em>was</em> good. If my parents weren&rsquo;t concerned about my enough to show me love, how could I love myself?</p>
<p>This all sounds very hyperbolic, doesn’t it. That I’ve blown everything over the top and the adolescent search for attention. That could be true, if it were not for the fact that I didn’t realise this until decades later. In fact, only in the last few months have I processed all of these feelings, prompted by the remarkable book <a href="/2023/03/03/finished-reading-four.html">Four Thousand Weeks</a> by Oliver burke. There are so many things to take away from this book, but the part discussing work by psychotherapist <a href="https://www.stephaniebrownphd.com">Stephanie Brown,</a> who had a practice in Silicon Valley in the 90s, hit me hard.</p>
<p>Her researched showed me that I was not alone in feeling the restlessness that constantly bubbled away deep inside me. These feelings are a form of self-medication and indicated I was doing everything I could to not feel something else. Not being able to sit still, rest or enjoy a basic activity is a defence mechanism against being alone with myself. In the same way a drug addict may be distancing themselves from the world by impairing themselves to deal with difficult emotions, I was doing the same with tasks. I enjoyed being busy so much because my brain was afraid of what would happen when I stopped.</p>
<p>The constant hustle got me absolutely nowhere. Even though I have achieved plenty of things, I didn&rsquo;t become a millionaire. All I got was obsessions bordering on neuroticism. Thankfully, I learnt to deal with difficult things and became aware of my mind hiding things from me. Learning more about myself and becoming a better person in the process.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When I sat down to watch this year&rsquo;s WWDC, Yes I am that sad it’s a bit of an event I sat down to specifically watch, I was already expecting the worst. Very few details had leaked about exciting updates to iOS or macOS, but there were leaks aplenty about the upcoming headset. I don’t like <a href="/2016/10/10/please-dont-put.html">computers on peoples faces</a>, and Apple did nothing to persuade me otherwise.</p>
<p>What it did do is create a buzz around VR again, and make sure that Apple <a href="/2023/05/06/the-apple-vr.html">didn’t miss the boat</a>. Both technologically and conceptually, the Vision Pro is already a success for Apple. I have no doubt that the device, even one that <em>starts</em> at $3,500, will be amazingly built. Containing numerous advancements and more than one breakthrough technologies. Yet in my heart of heart, I am conflicted by this device.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/90c66f9207.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The overly airbrushed demos showed a world that simply doesn’t exist. Without mentioning that most of the videos appeared to be CGI, the concept Apple tried to create missed entirely. Whilst I expected the Vision Pro to be marketed heavily to creatives, the ability to interact with a massive screen anywhere you like is appealing, I didn&rsquo;t expect the Black Mirroresque dystopian predictions. The vision of eyes displayed on a screen, so people know you can see them, genuinely made me shudder.</p>
<p>At the same time, I was also blown away by the device. The same dread filled eyes are a hint that Apple has thought about users being in a world of their own, and also the wider issue of people around you knowing they can be seen. This is Apple business 101, wait and see where a market leads to and then produce a device with its users in mind. Once it goes on sale, there will be no questions about the way the device works or that it delivers on the promises made.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of my worry comes from the rousing blog posts and YouTube videos crowing about how good it will be. There&rsquo;s far too much tech bro web3 weirdness going on for my liking. Anyone that expresses concern or, god forbid, thinks the whole thing is a bit silly, is met with “you just don’t get it” type replies. I do get it, I thoroughly understand the device, the promise of spacial computing, I just weep a little for the world it <em>might</em> create.</p>
<p>I say might because I am just not convinced that the world conforms to Apple&rsquo;s make believe world. I’ve never done half of what Apple seems to think people do with their devices, and I can&rsquo;t see a world where people put massive goggles on to watch a film, at home, alone. Sure, it gives you a much more immersive experience where you can drown out everything around you, but is that <em>really</em> what is missing from our lives. Perhaps it is, and I am just an old man shouting at the clouds.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6489cb8e29.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The thing about my strange melancholic feelings about the Vision Pro is the unshakeable feeling that maybe I am wrong. Perhaps people will strap something on their face to watch films, or record the world around them, or entertain themselves on a plane journey – and I am just a bit sad about that. Charlie Warzel summed this up perfectly when talking about the Vision Pro being the perfect device for the Apocalypse. He wrote “a future in which people with enough disposable income can retreat from the physical world into the gated-face community of a 360-degree iPhone screen” and it scared me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no preaching here. I use my devices to death, despite <a href="/2020/08/09/i-cant-go.html">my desire not too</a>, so I am not on the outside looking in. More on the inside looking out, desiring a simpler world with less intrusion and distraction but accepting that the world is not mine to mould. I could see the advantage of something like Google Glass, that overlayed information onto your world. Perhaps even Snapchat Glasses or Facebooks Ray-bans for being device free. To a certain point, I can also see the benefits of the Vision Pro for some demos Apple used, such as working on a large screen in the office, but the rest of it is just weird.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ebf56e5ccb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>For the first time in a long time, we are introduced to a new computing world. I genuinely understand the excitement that I see in the tech world around me. I get it. You are not wrong to feel that way. I just think it&rsquo;s been over sold and there will be many people who feel some very strange emotions after buying this device, and not just from the motion sickness.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>In modern times we have grown to rely on them, but starting with the first device to run them we’ve had a strange relationship to apps. No more so in the world of iOS, that for many years clung so rigidly it the ‘tap square, open app’ mentality that every single facet was sandboxed away from the other. A strange way to deal with things given that our whole lives are now on smart devices. Perhaps with iOS17, we are finally seeing what applications should have been from the start.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. Apple’s approach was the best approach when devices were tiny, underpowered in both processing and battery departments, devices that were more of a novelty. In a world where <a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world#:~:text=How%20Many%20People%20Have%20Smartphones%20In%20The%20World%3F&amp;text=According%20to%20Statista%2C%20in%202023,world%27s%20population%20owns%20a%20smartphone.">6.92 billion people</a> rely on a smartphone, it starts to get a little silly. Why doesn’t my calendar app talk to my to-do app? Why doesn’t my sometimes smart voice assistant add content to my app of choice without vocal gymnastics? It&rsquo;s time to reconsider what an app is?</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2a7bcb1350.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The latest iteration of iOS, version 17, scheduled to roll out to users in September, introduces interactive widgets. A large advancement on the idea that apps shouldn’t just exist behind squares on your homescreen. Or app library, or whatever it’s called this update. You should, in fact, be able to interact with the features of an app outside the confines Apple usually places on them – it is almost as if they get it now.</p>
<p>Once I choose to install an app on my device, it should be able to interact with my device in whatever way I see fit. My device shouldn’t be set up to work with some apps better than others, or dictate to me what apps I have to have on my phone. If I ask Siri to remind me of a task, it should put that task in whatever app I want it to. Instead of jumping through all the linguistic hoops I have to currently. Anyone who has asked a simple command like “Remind me to call John tomorrow at 5pm in Todoist” knows that no-one in their right mind pronounces it Tod-oh-ist.</p>
<p>Apple, and any smart device maker for that matter, needs to stop forcing things on me that I don’t want and listen to what I do want. Perhaps I want to use <a href="/2022/12/31/manual-practices-to.html">Todoist</a> as my reminders app, <a href="/2019/12/03/i-keep-coming.html">Bear</a> as my notes app, and WhatsApp as my text and video call app. iOS should get out of my way and allow me to do so, with the relevant checks for privacy and data access, of course. What’s the point in taking all of these wonderful applications that I can install on my phone and hiding them away behind an icon, an app should be part of my phone and the way I use it.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It seems like the WWDC keynote was only yesterday. Well, it was, but I’ve been playing with iOS17 ever since, and found numerous little things that were not spoken about in the keynote, so I thought I’d point them out here. Also, I need to sleep now.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Listen, <a href="/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html">I love Apple notes</a>, but there are a few things that are lacking to make it great. Unfortunately, Apple never seemed interested in its stock apps until the last few updates, and Notes once again gets quite a few teaks in iOS17.</p>
<p>They spoke about PDFs and improvements to mark up, but Apple Notes also features the ability to link notes together. It’s not quite the double square bracket easy linking that modern notes apps seem to love, but it helps bring some PKM style linking to the best notes app on your iPhone.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/480d42ee3a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Also improved is the ease of selecting styling options, with everything available under a floating add button. I’d like to see adding a link available here too because using the text selection options is a little awkward, but at least things like indenting and font styling are easier to get to. There’s even less reason to <a href="/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html">use anything else</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d8b343bf0b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="reminders">Reminders</h2>
<p>Apple mentioned interactive widgets on iPadOS17, and thankfully they are also in iOS17. The Reminders one shown piqued my interest to see if there were any other improvements, and thankfully there are. Reminders has always lacked that little something to really snatch usage away from to do apps, but this might tip a few over the edge.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/37bf74c909.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The stock Reminders app now features the ability to add in sections to your lists and also manage them in a Kanban style. Of course, they never call it that, but the ‘columns’ layout found behind the three dots reveals the same functionality. The ease of adding and editing columns needs some work, but this style of to do management could remove a lot of reliance on third-party apps.</p>
<p>Once again, the iOS update is nothing revolutionary, it introduced lots of little updates that will improve usage. I keep stumbling upon little tweaks that should really help me, so I will keep posting them – follow me through activity pub <a href="http://micro.blog/gr36?remote_follow=1">greg@gr36.com</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For quite a while, I’ve had this feeling that my <a href="/2023/05/10/my-adventures-with.html">system of writing notes</a> in my <a href="/2023/03/12/what-is-my.html">notebook</a> was needless. That I was writing too many things down, and generally speaking, I didn’t refer to them. Which meant that my practice was a waste of time and energy. That was until I experienced someone else looking for something they had written down only a few weeks ago, and I instantly felt better about my system.</p>
<p>Once I heard the words “what app was I using then” I knew the chance of finding that information had drastically reduced. This is not a post about belittling anyone, it’s more about my realisation that too much complexity ruins everything. Multiple blogs, apps, and anything else where there is a question on where to put ‘it’ means you’ll have a harder time finding it when you need it.</p>
<p>I always opt for <a href="/2023/03/03/the-simplest-path.html">the simplest path</a>. The one that stores everything in one place and removes as much cognitive energy as possible. We’ve all had to turn the house upside-down trying to find something you kept safe, but you can&rsquo;t remember where, and the same is true for information you want to retrieve. It doesn’t matter if it’s a digital thing, or a physical thing, if you don’t know where you put it, you stand much less chance of finding it.</p>
<p>This way isn’t easy. There&rsquo;s always a new fancy app launched, with a whole heap of <em>paid</em> influencers telling you how great it is (until they move to the next one next week). There are always questions about digital calendars, notebook, apps and everything other place your stuff can be stored. <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/pages/about">Ryder Carroll</a>, the person behind Bullet Journaling, says “the more apps, the more apps” and this simple mantra should be your guiding light.</p>
<p>The more complexity you introduce, the more questions need to be asked at the time of storage, which leads to less chance of it being useful in the future. The more thinking you need to do, the more chance you’ll either not bother or never find it again. Whatever it is you are trying to save will fall through the gaps, never to be seen again.</p>

      <p>Nilay Patel <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23712602/google-search-25-years-anniversary-ai-artificial-intelligence">for The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in an information ecosystem whose design is dominated by the needs of the Google Search machine — a robot whose beneficent gaze can create entire industries just as easily as its cool indifference can destroy them. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is exactly correct. Every website must conform to their standards, bow to their non-disclosed algorithm changes. Google not so much shapes the web, more smashes it into its image.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All those bold subheadings in the middle of articles asking random questions? That’s how Google answers those questions on the search results page.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Searching the web for information is an increasingly user-hostile experience, an arbitrage racket run by search-optimised content sharks running an ever-changing series of monetisation hustles with no regard for anything but collecting the most pennies at the biggest scale.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is why literally any other way to search the web reliably will explode. Everyone knows that a Google search is littered with SEO spam, but there is no other option and I feel as if they push towards LLM led search is a response to this.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Ever since the pandemic hit in early 2020, I&rsquo;ve mostly been enjoying the comfort of working from home. Of course, there have been a few weeks here and there when I had other commitments that required me to be elsewhere. But at least 3 out of 5 days, you can find me tucked away in my cozy spare bedroom, diligently working away. Working from home has brought me incredible benefits like improved focus, work-life balance, and so much more. However, as my professional journey progresses, I find myself having to spread my time between home and office life, and it can be a little annoying.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, my job itself isn&rsquo;t the annoying part. It&rsquo;s the fact that I have the opportunity to tap into the benefits of both working situations, but figuring out how to make the most of it can be a bit of a challenge. Let&rsquo;s face it, working from home (WFH) is an absolute game-changer for many of us — I&rsquo;m a huge fan. It allows me to work longer, deeper and better without the distractions of a traditional office setting. But, there&rsquo;s no denying the wonderful perks of being around other people.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/52740b6b13.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I have begun to appreciate the value of bouncing ideas off my colleagues, engaging in vibrant conversations, and simply having that positive energy that comes from working side by side with others. That&rsquo;s why most days, you&rsquo;ll find me popping into the office for a quick meeting or a planning session before heading back home. Lucky for me, my office is only a couple of miles away from home, but it&rsquo;s still a tad inconvenient.</p>
<p>I have a desk at work and another one at home, which means I&rsquo;m stuck with two keyboards, two monitors, and all the other gadgets I&rsquo;d rather not drag around. It also means that neither place feels like the perfect fit for me. While I do enjoy some of the advantages of both working environments to a certain extent, it&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;m constantly on the go, working from different spots all the time. Maybe the solution lies in finding a balance by splitting my time and establishing clear boundaries. Honestly, I have no idea how flexible workers manage it, but I&rsquo;m open to suggestions!</p>

      <p>Every so often I see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13q8jzz/you_meet_your_13_year_old_self_but_can_only_tell/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=15">posts</a>, usually on Reddit, that say something similar to “what would you tell your 15-year-old self” and I always think through the same things. There have been times in my life that I’d rather had avoided. Terrible, painful times that have left emotional and physical scars on myself. However, as an ever showing optimist, it was all worth it to get here.</p>
<p>I could tell myself to not play in that football game that ended my career. Or avoid that relationship that ruined me for a few years. Life events that you would rather not go through always come to mind, but as with every time travelling film teaches us, small events lead to more significant changes. There could be some gains to be made, but if there is any risk of me not getting to meet my wife and have my wonderful kids, for me, it isn’t worth the risk.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/25721f7d02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Friedrich Nietzsche proposed a thought experiment based on <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/nietzsches-idea-of-the-eternal-recurrence-2670659">Eternal Recurrence</a>. A demon comes to you at night and says the life you are living is just a cycle. One you will carry on reliving over and over again, exactly the same. All the pain, all the joy. Everything, as it was, forever. Would this change your outlook on life? Would you look at this as a gift or a curse?</p>
<p>Greater than this though. Whenever you experience painful times, would you look on them better, knowing that they all lead to a point that made you happy. That in those darkest hours when you felt like the world was ending, there was always light at the end. Your newly opened eyes would treat these life events with a more Stoic approach. An acceptance that these bad times need to be bared to get to the good times.</p>
<p>Then this demon is not required to change your way of thinking because this reality is already true. Through all darkness, there comes light, not matter hoe small. Although we are not destined to repeat our lives over and over again (that we know of) the same thoughts are true.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>One of the biggest leaking Apple products I can ever remember might actually see the light of day at WWDC next month. You read that right, it looks highly likely Tim Cook will take to the stage on the Keynote for Apple&rsquo;s develop conference and finally utter the words Reality Pro. Unfortunately, the long-rumoured VR experience from Apple has already missed its chance to make a splash, and will be launched into a market that doesn’t really exist.</p>
<p>Since at least the mid-80’s at various volume levels, futurists have been telling us virtual reality will be a massive thing. The slightly dystopian predictions are that we will at least strap things to our faces instead of staring at screens, and if you listen to some people, we might live a portion of our lives in a virtual world. However, that reality has never really panned out.</p>
<p>It has to be said I am extremely negative towards putting any <a href="/2016/10/10/please-dont-put.html">computer on your face</a>, but still open to the possibility. In many respects, it makes sense, perhaps not to live in a virtual world, but consuming content or playing games is a realistic current and future bet for VR devices. This is where Apple sees its headset fitting in, <a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-vr-headset">running iPad type apps</a> and not diving into a metaverse. Being able to put on oversized goggles to be able to watch or use a gigantic screen instead of needing a large panel appeals to many demographics.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/175c9e87b9.jpg" alt="Image credit: Marcus Kane/Sketchfab" title="Image credit: Marcus Kane/Sketchfab"></p>
<h2 id="you-missed-it">You Missed It</h2>
<p>The issue is that the market for this kind of device is already exhausted. Either physically or metaphorically. Niche gaming sections are saturated with cheaper Quest or PlayStation devices. With others completely turned off to the idea due to a bombardment of Meta né Facebook insisting on the future taking place in their world. The truth is Apple scrambled to build a device to fit into a potential market that was promised for years on end, but no longer exists.</p>
<p>Whatever Apple&rsquo;s entry into VR looks like; or whenever it arrives, it looks set to miss its market bar early adopter Apple fans with too much money. Granted there was a time for about 6 beautiful months where this device made sense. After months of not being able to navigate the web without being inundated with the word metaverse, that time has gone. That time <em>may</em> arrive, but like having business built around web3 in 2023, there’s not much hope currently.</p>
<p>That is the issue with entering into markets that are still emerging. You risk making the wrong bets. Wasting considerable amounts on money building devices that fall flat rather than sail the current wave of hype. This was something that Apple were notoriously good at. They waited, watched and launched their product a little later than others, but well-rounded and pushing industries forward. You only have to look at products like AirPods as an example of Apple usual ‘wait and see’ market tactic.</p>
<p>Which makes Apples VR device all the more strange, and something that no doubt is making them pause and think a bit longer. However, it can be said that we are not dealing with the same Apple any more, and even they can make mistakes – huge million-dollar mistakes. Just don&rsquo;t mention AirPower.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/05/05/intentionality.html"><h1 class="p-name">Intentionality</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>A fairly simple word. Loaded with meaning and a fair bit of woo woo. Who doesn’t intend to do things? However, you’d actually be surprised the number of things you do without really thinking about them. With your mind either wandering around or focused entirely on something else. With a little practice and a lot of thought, intentional actions can spark new feeling and improve mental health.</p>
<p>I do numerous things each day with little to no thought. Due to <a href="/2022/08/30/the-world-is.html">my daughter</a>, and me being a bit of a control freak, I wake at the same time, do the same things and my day doesn’t really start deviating from that same path hours later. In many ways, this period each day, I have very little intentionality. I am not thinking about specifically doing these tasks, but know they need to be done. I’m on autopilot and the time just slips away, but the tasks get done.</p>
<p>There’s another side. A darker loss of intentionality that robs my time and doesn’t achieve anything. Social media <a href="/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html">muscle memory</a> means that despite having no intention of doom scrolling, I am there before I realise it. I intended to do something else, but now the time is gone, and I feel bad about the world.</p>
<p>Even when I complete tasks that I enjoy, that I look forward to, I am often not present. Not intentional with the moment, not spending my time paying attention. I am on autopilot. Thinking about something else entirely and not enjoying what I am doing. No matter what is happening, it’s far too easy to be distracted, to not pay attention, to spend time in your head instead of in the wider world.</p>
<p>When you are paying attention, you can find enjoyment and interest in places you least expect to find it. When you actually look at things and do things intentionally and think about them while you do them, you get much more from the activity itself. If you are not intentional with your time, you will spend it too fast, and you cannot get it back again.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I read Matt Birchler’s <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/i-tried-to-migrate-to-todoist-it-didnt-go-well/">post on The Sweet Setup</a> as soon as it appeared in my feed. Anything he has to say usually leaves me better after consuming it, and it also mentioned Todoist, which I have a soft sport for after <a href="/2020/05/18/how-i-use.html">becoming a brand ambassador</a> a few years ago. It really is a great post, and one that I’ve been able to feel swirling around in Matt&rsquo;s head for some time, but it touches on two points that I really wanted to stress.</p>
<p>As early as the second paragraph, he points out that chasing the perfect app is a fool&rsquo;s game. It is, as Matt puts it, “a path that leads to madness” and will result in you just going around from app to app and not actually using the thing to get anything done. I’m a <a href="/2021/03/19/looking-for-my.html">scholar of this</a> pathetic chasing, so I think I can speak from experience when I wholeheartedly agree with Matt.</p>
<p>He’s clear on this, and does a fantastic job of pointing this out. He is no doubt aware of the sway his posts can have over people (<a href="/2020/01/21/migrating-from-wordpress.html">my self included</a>), so this declaimer of sorts is even more worth paying attention to. If you take absolutely nothing away from the post apart from this, then it will have been a worthwhile read. If, however, you have now downloaded Todoist, or Things, stop and just use what you have.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a2cc9b451b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="there-are-feelings-involved">There Are Feelings Involved</h2>
<p>The second point that is hinted at several points in the post, and then downright stated towards the end, is that you have to pay attention to the way things feel. It&rsquo;s an important trait to be aware of and something that you may not be able to put into words, but even the best app or system in the world can <strong>feel</strong> wrong. If it does, don’t be afraid to leave it alone despite everyone else evangelising for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It turns out that the generally joyful UI of Things was more important to me than I realised, and a longer feature list couldn’t win me over — Matt Birchler</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt speaks of his yearning for change, and whilst it’s essential to take into accounts what other apps can do, if the app you are using just feels better, stick with it. Unless you are hitting walls and cant do things because features are missing, you won&rsquo;t gain anything by messing around.</p>
<p>If you get a better feeling from the app you already have you will use it more, something particularly critical if that app you are using needs you to use it to get things done. It is one of the reasons I now just <a href="/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html">use a notebook</a>. Everything in my logical brain tells me it’s worse, possibly in every single way, but <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">the feeling of using it and writing in it</a> trumps all.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I used one platform, almost solely, for 13 years. It&rsquo;s not as long as some, but on first joining Twitter in 2009 the service felt pretty small, and I didn’t really know what to do with it, but I instantly ‘got it’ and it became my home. I tweeted constantly, shared a large part of my life on it, and met some remarkable people that I am glad to call friends. Leaving it behind was the best decision, but part of my was left behind when I did.</p>
<p>Using Twitter, I didn’t feel that I needed to shape myself to deal with algorithms or trendy topics. I just tweeted what I thought or what I was doing and for some reason people liked it. My followers ballooned during my time hacking iPhones, and later on, Android phones. With many sticking around for years to come. I started and sunsetted two reasonably successful podcasts and owe most of the success to Twitter.</p>
<p>I feel as if I gave Twitter such a massive portion of my life and all of it is now gone. Although, as said before, I am glad I walked away, I feel sad that that time in my life has gone for good. Upon handing over a portion of my personality to Twitter, I expected it to go on forever, but that little package of my life just exists in memory now. No more good times (although to be fair, they stopped in about 2018) but no more stress and worry.</p>
<p>Twitter was the only place on the internet that I hated with all my heart, yet couldn’t help still using it. I felt indebted because I had given it such an important place in my life that my usage <em>had</em> to continue. I hated constantly broke my life down into 280 character bite sized chunks. Thankfully, I was given a big enough push and my mind can now heal. I accept that this part of me is now dead, and long may it stay that way.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>As millions of users scramble to see where to place our social alliance in the next wave of locked platforms, there is an opposite movement. Existing social networks are investigating how to attract new users but seem destined to put their foot in it by ruining their service. One after another, services change major features, or their whole app, searching for revenue. Forgetting everything that set them apart in the first place and ruining lots of the user experience. All in desperate need of ad revenue.</p>
<p>You don’t have to look very hard to see how much can be generated by showing your users tailored adverts. Despite every user hating them, gigantic companies with ridiculous income are built on the back of them. The king of the hill and the admiration of others in the market is Facebook, who rakes in more than $110billion a year, with all of it being, bar a minimal percentage, from adverts.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/696801c38b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Although social networks that don’t and won’t show adverts exist, such as <a href="https://glass.photo">photo sharing app Glass</a>, there is no denying that showing adverts is vastly more profitable. You only need to look at Netflix and the realisation that <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/netflix-sees-advertising-business-generating-10-of-total-revenue-as-it-matures-73938137">ad supported users provide more income</a> than paid ones. As soon as this becomes reality, the service is destined to be ruined beyond recognition and dissolve into a regular TV network, over the internet.</p>
<p>Social media upstart from 2022 BeReal is in a bit of a tailspin and <a href="https://getmatter.com/email/23422113/?token=23422113%3AStzdEG76rMkxOLl_FX9Z-gRB4Xw">currently testing</a> the ability for users to post twice more a day. A move no doubt motivated by the reduced time that their users interact with the app per day. The max two-minute scramble to post during the allotted time is simply not enough time to sell users things, and that cuts the earning potential down dramatically. In return, turning their app from something different and quirky with a unique take, to a worse Snapchat.</p>
<p>While we’re on the ephemeral messaging app, it seems they are loosing themselves in the pursuit of ad revenue too. Once Snap employee and current stockholder Ellis Hamburger <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23672769/social-media-inevitable-death-monetization-growth-hacks">tells their tale</a> of fighting the good fight inside the company. As they put it, “trying to make Snapchat different from every other social media app” only to become aware of the thirstiness as a death knell to what makes it great. As they search for more and more engagement, to show you more and more ads.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t exclusive to mobile apps, either. Adverts have ruined the web as a whole for as long as most of us can remember. Why did we bring this print-based mentality to the web? Covering every inch of spare space on your nicely designed web page like you did the spare inches in the editorials. And the news stories. And the buildings. And the <a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/boat-advertisements-beach-vacation-ad/">beaches</a>.</p>
<p>Like an invasive species, adverts ruin everything. They take up space where they shouldn&rsquo;t be, they track everyone around the web. They try to sell you things you don&rsquo;t need, and now they are changing your favourite apps and ruining services because they pay the most money. Advertising dollars are like a siren&rsquo;s call that cannot be avoided. You can tie yourself blindfolded to the mast of your ship as long as you like, but once you succumb to their call, they strangle the life out of great things and make them suck.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Without going back and checking where, I am sure I have referred to my wife description of me. No, not that one. This might come of a bit of a shock to someone that follow me online, given my disposition to moan about lots of things — she calls me &ldquo;annoyingly positive&rdquo;. To her, I am that guy that looks at everything one way and sees where we can move forward from it.</p>
<p>This stems from a childhood that I wont go into, but I have always had an ability to see the way forward, try to lean into the positive aspects of everything and &ldquo;just keep swimming&rdquo; as <a href="https://youtu.be/E-ZF5r1F7nY?t=42">Dory would say</a>. Plus I&rsquo;m an introvert and hate complaining anyway!</p>
<p>What this doesn&rsquo;t mean is I am not naive in thinking the down times don&rsquo;t exist. I can still &lsquo;sit in the mud&rsquo; as Simon Sink would call it, but more I realise that this too shall pass. Optimism is about being hopeful and positive about the future, that bad things <em>will</em> happen, and it&rsquo;s ok to have struggles and issues with them, but there are always better times coming. You may feel like you are in a dark tunnel at the moment, but optimism keeps me working towards the light and everything will be ok.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Since the launch of dark mode in iOS I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve disabled the feature other than testing. I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of the constant white used in modern iOS and, although debatable, it saves a bit of battery life by switching off pixels. However apps that don&rsquo;t customise the way dark mode looks really suck.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s much more personal preference that&rsquo;s needed once you flick the switch to dark mode. Some apps opt for replacing the glaring white for simple black. While others go for dark shades of blue or grey instead. Meaning that apps can show their personality and make theirs stand out, but not always to taste.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a99e236dc1.jpg" alt="Screenshots of micro.blog and instead in both light and dark mode"></p>
<p>Take the above examples of the upcoming 3.0 update to the micro.blog app and Instagram. One of my most used apps micro.blog uses a not very dark blue colour which is not to my taste at all. I&rsquo;d much prefer the black of Instagram for the app background and this is where dark mode triggers much more personal preference.</p>
<p>Is it enough for me to stop using the app, no, but it&rsquo;s enough to make me think almost every time I open it that I wish I could change it. Couple this with having a look at <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a> and <a href="/2023/04/15/i-know-its.html">thinking their app looks great</a>, I switched into light mode for a bit and what a refreshing change it makes. I&rsquo;m still not convinced with all the white burning my eyes, but it takes away all these personal preferences and leaves me with good looking apps.</p>
<p>Thankfully a lot of apps give you the option to pick and choose, or even theme the way the app looks. The excellent micro.blog app <a href="/2023/02/13/gluon-my-perfect.html">Gluon</a> gives you the choice to switch to an OLED friendly black background. <a href="/2018/04/29/finding-a-use.html">Drafts</a>, the well liked app for all of your text even offers customised themes and a selection of downloadable options. I just found it strange that I don&rsquo;t really care about every app using white, or slightly off white, but when it comes to off black - yuck.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I think I get it now. I&rsquo;ve been asked for years how I manage to write a lot, and I just shrug and think it&rsquo;s not so hard. Even though my blogging does come and go I manage to have plenty of ideas and publish posts, but not at the moment.</p>
<p>At the minute I feel as if I am blocked from ideas. I feel as if <a href="/2023/04/08/inspiration.html">inspiration</a> doesn&rsquo;t like me, or my brain is  now broken. I&rsquo;ve tried to push through this a few times, just <a href="/2020/08/17/sitting-in-the.html">sit in the chair</a> and write something but I end up messing around on social media. Frustrating as it is, at least I don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to post - I just enjoy when I do.</p>
<p>I will just keep posting things I find and making short posts waiting for something to strike. For an idea that lasts long enough for post to be written or my motivation improves.</p>

      <p>My daughter is the cutest little thing. I know everyone says that about their kids, but here is my submission as proof. Lucie struggles with almost everything, she has what most people call ‘complex needs’. She relies completely on us as a family to help to support her, but she tries her hardest to do whatever one else does.</p>
<p>She has only two loves in the world, <a href="/2022/09/20/lucie-loves-shoes.html">shoes, and</a> teddies. Perhaps I come a distant third, but I’m not convinced. Anyway. The world seems to finally be waking up to providing more accessible things like clothes and activities, and along with this comes toys that actually represent disabled people. We found the greatest cuddly toy of all time on Facebook, and Lucie absolutely loves it.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b76c178768.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s a brightly coloured bunny with a feeding tube, just like Lucie&rsquo;s. Complete with attachable tube and syringe! When Lucie first saw it, she lifted her top and tapped her button to show that she understood the bunny had one like her. She now carries it around to doctor&rsquo;s appointments and occasionally when she is hungry, and my heart melts.</p>
<p>It’s remarkable what representation in the things that we see means to people. The bunny is just like her and means she will never feel alone in her struggles.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The arrival times of ideas are strange. Often when I feel like writing, there is nothing ready to come out. Then at other points, ideas come at the wrong times and never get to fruition. Despite thinking about the ideas, and sometimes writing a blog post in my head, they are gone as soon as I get distracted. As I strain myself afterwards, willing my neurones to make the same connections they did before, I am typically led to think about inspiration and where it comes from.</p>
<p>For me, it frequently comes from the strangest places. Occasionally, I do go looking for it, consuming books or watching videos and jotting down some ideas, willing for the ideas to coalesce into a blog post. These can then be incubated and sometimes appear later on, but often times trying to force it doesn’t work. Every so often, it is as if my <a href="/2023/04/06/valid-feelings.html">emotions block me</a> from thinking too deeply about anything.</p>
<p>At the points, quite out of the blue, something will be said in passing and hit me with a burst of energy. A throw away line can cause me to become excited at where my thoughts are going, or pause whatever I am doing and just think for a while. At moments like these, it is not a surprise that some people believe the inspiration for things comes from a magical place. Inspiration regularly doesn’t make sense to me, and when you don’t understand things, it’s easier to blame the gods!</p>
<p>Of course, the inspiration I need to write a terrible blog post is a lot different to the ideas needed for great pieces of art. Writing a book, or creating a masterpiece, requires study, dedication and the using of time wisely. Perhaps when your life is dedicated to such a thing, inspiration strikes much easier, that it is like a skill that needs to be worked on, or a muscle that must be trained.</p>
<p>The fact that my brain can get from one throw away line listening to a podcast, and produce a few hundred words is still a little magical to me, and I hope that never stops.</p>

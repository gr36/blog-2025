     <p>Colin Friedersdorf writing in The Atlantic about why they <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/08/instagram-friends-photos-videos/679341/">Why I Hate Instagram Now</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meta, Instagram’s parent company, still says its mission is giving people “the power to build community and bring the world closer together.” As it thwarts my efforts to see all the photos posted by people I know and chose to follow, I call bullshit. Injecting Reels in my feed, then refusing to let me abolish those diversions, hasn’t just put my loved ones in competition with viral nonsense––it has repeatedly subverted my attempts to ensure that my loved ones win.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what drives me insane about modern social media because it’s not even just Instagram. In the constant search for engagement, they serve you entertainment before the things that you actually want to see. You know, posts from the people you follow.</p>
<p>Whenever pressed on this, Instagram gets all hand wavy, and they roll out their practiced spiel about video engagement being up blah blah blah. It clearly works for the things they wish to measure (presumably advert impressions and attention) but not for anyone I ever talk to about these issues. There still isn’t a place for us photographers to go, and that still makes me sad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Question is, will I upgrade? Well, no. Not any time soon anyway. The M1 Air still does everything I need it to extremely well. So why upgrade? Why drop another £1,000 or so on the latest version of the Air? Because it looks a little nicer? Because it comes in blue? Because the chipset is 2 increments better? Nah, I&rsquo;ll stick with this workhorse until it dies.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure if it is them M1 chip, but around this time my motivation to upgrade so often seems to have disappeared. It was such a revolution in power and efficiency that the following iterations do not receive anywhere near the attention—which is great.</p>
<p>I’d love to see Apple do something more with their laptop and push the design forward. Perhaps a really thin and light device for ultra portability because to be honest, the battery life of MacBooks is a little insane now!</p>

     <p>I write a lot on my iPhone. If I can estimate, I would say at least 70% of my blog posts are published from it. This is largely due to having it with me all the time, and it being comfortable to type on after years of practice. However, I think there is something said for having one app open, without all the toolbars and other things to go with it, that helps me get from idea to publishable post quicker.</p>
<p>As I was deep in thought and wondering why I publish so much from my phone, and why that has been replaced by my iPad. I discovered I had already touched on this point in 2022 in my post <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/26/the-quiet-and.html">The quiet and calm of iOS</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I type out this post back at home on my Mac, I realise how much calmer iOS is when you expect nothing of it. I wasn’t looking for a do it all machine, I was looking for it do to a few simple tasks, and do them well.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure, this iPad can multitask like a champ and have windows floating all over the place just as my MacBook can, but I don’t want that any more. I want something I can use for writing my blog posts, editing photos and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2022/12/14/matter-my-most.html">catching up</a> with my favourite blog feeds. Don’t get me wrong, I much prefer getting things done on my Mac, but with all that complexity comes the added distraction of work emails and the mess of files on my home screen waiting to be completed.</p>
<p>Whereas as <em>my</em> iPad has none of those things. It could, but I’ve set it up to work in the way that I want. In part due to the fact I am easily distractible and can’t be trusted, but mainly because I want one window (or at most two to refer to something) at a time. I have even set up screen time to block social media sites and other things that I am likely to fall off into. No work emails, no reminders pings, just the things I enjoy doing and that’s the perfect ‘computer’.</p>
<p>That not to say <em>your</em> iPad can’t do much more, and you’re thinking how stupid I am for not having Stage Manager float windows all over my screen, so I can edit videos and listen to background music. I think it&rsquo;s remarkable that a tablet, albeit a ridiculously expensive one, can be all of these things to different people — but mine is just a full window machine, thank you very much.</p>

     <p>Zach Seward being clear that <a href="#">AI is not like you and me</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aristotle, who had a few things to say about human nature, once declared, &ldquo;The greatest thing by far is to have a command of metaphor,&rdquo; but academics studying the personification of tech have long observed that metaphor can just as easily command us. Metaphors shape how we think about a new technology, how we feel about it, what we expect of it, and ultimately, how we use it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I highlighted a lot of this article to save for leather musing, but it got me thinking about things immediately. I’d recommend reading the entire post if you are even remotely interested in AI as it&rsquo;s pretty eye-opening, well written and diligently researched.</p>
<p>The decisions made by the creators of technology and particularly AI dictate a lot of the things we think about it. What’s more is most people will not even be aware of the effects of portraying your product as if it were a person. The fact is, we give AI much more slack than we would with other things because it is portrayed with a friendly, eager to help tone and that’s by design.</p>
<p>LLMS don’t just spurt back walls of text, they portray the answers in conversational styles, leading to increased levels of trust. Because you can’t be mad at something that apologises for being wrong so provocatively. Spurring in us a forgiving nature as if they were our friend. Artificial Intelligence doesn’t get things spectacularly wrong after all, they simply &ldquo;hallucinate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As Zack puts it brilliantly, “AI isn&rsquo;t doing shit. It is not thinking, let alone plotting. It has no aspirations. It isn&rsquo;t even an it so much as a wide-ranging set of methods for pattern recognition”. Imagine if you looked up a topic in an encyclopaedia, only for it to be entirely wrong and reference things that don’t exist, you wouldn’t tolerate it. Yet Search GPT is already <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/07/searchgpt-openai-error/679248/">getting things wrong</a>, and that’s OK because it is portrayed as being just like us. Well, it&rsquo;s not.</p>

     <p>Karissa Bell for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-says-fck-that-to-closed-platforms-235700788.html">Engadget</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zuckerberg then launched into a lengthy rant about his frustrations with “closed” ecosystems like Apple’s App Store. None of that is particularly new, as the Meta founder has been feuding with Apple for years. But then Zuckerberg, who is usually quite controlled in his public appearances, revealed just how frustrated he is, telling Huang that his reaction to being told “no” is “fuck that.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m conflicted when Zuckerberg says anything that I agree with. On the one hand, it is great news for the web. Zuckerberg hates closed platforms and is working to open up Threads to the open web, yet I can’t shake the thought that most of this is simple theatre.</p>
<p>Of course, Zuck hates Apple&rsquo;s closed system…because he wants access to all the date from users. It’s not his good nature that leads him to open up Threads, it is the fact that it helps with all the things that Facebook is criticised for. He can simply point to the fact that users are free to move, and then continue to do what he wants on ‘his’ platform.</p>
<p>But there’s this little part of me that wants to believe. That after years of “oh we didn’t mean to do that” when they break things, Meta is becoming a good-natured company.</p>

     <p>Perhaps not all of us, but for many people who are interested in tech, and particularly bloggers, the allure of being able to use a tablet to get things done is a strong one. I’ve been there, realised that I can’t make it do what I want, yet always have one hanging around. Here I am, once again, writing on an iPad Pro—and these words are nothing more than to justify my expenditure!</p>
<p>There was only a minimal time I didn’t have an iPad at all. Despite it leaving <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html">quite dramatically</a>, soon returning in the form of a 2018 iPad Pro that I had until recently. It was often <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/18/all-work-and.html">my creative computer</a>, but one that came in and out of my life whilst <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/26/the-quiet-and.html">expecting nothing in return</a>. I’ve bought and sold ‘better’ iPads alongside this one, but expected too much from them. Whereas my 2018 version was worth more to me than anyone else, and suck around when all others failed.</p>
<p><img src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/uploads/2024/leon-seibert-ljypkpebt4i-unsplash.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it finally <a href="https://gregmorris.photo/2024/07/24/need-to-upgrade.html">gave up the ghost</a>, so I began looking around for a replacement. To be honest, I wanted another 2018 version but, whilst being very cheap, they run the risk of dying the same as my old one. I should have taken Mere Civilian’s <a href="https://merecivilian.com/why-did-i-buy-the-m2-ipad-pro-instead-of-the-m4/">advice</a> and picked up a M2 version, but there was something about the new M4’s that appealed to me. Not because of the power, but because of the nice screen and slimmed down weight.</p>
<p>So, I am sitting here, typing this out on an 11” m4, with an Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard. I got it very lightly used, after trying a 13” version first that didn’t fit my workflow, and traded in numerous bits of tech that were no longer needed. There are trade off here. The keyboard is a little too small, the size isn’t as good for drawing as the larger version, but it fits better into my life being more portable.</p>
<p>I don’t for one second think that many people should buy these new iPads unless you get a good deal. They are expensive and are in many ways complete overkill, but I’m enjoying having an iPad back in my life after even just a few weeks away.</p>

     <p>Matt Birchler writing about <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/that-feature-is-so-cool-ill-never-use-it-though/">Math Notes in iPadOS 18</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…while I can academically understand why they’re so impressive and that some people will get massive use out of them, they aren’t valuable to me, so they don’t move the needle at all in terms of me being able to close up some of the friction points I have with using an iPad for all the things I’d love to do with any iPad.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve missed so much in the last few months, especially around the new iPad and iPadOS features. In my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/07/26/need-to-upgrade.html">continued search</a> for a new one, I am going back and reading old reviews. This bit from Matt stuck out for me, and being able to see the usefulness of features to other people is such a transferable skill to have.</p>
<p>There’s a tendency to rubbish anything you don’t immediately see as useful. I once had an interaction on Reddit that thankfully I can&rsquo;t remember it word for word; however, they were claiming that updates to the Sony A7vi to include a screenreader and other accessibility features are pointless. They couldn’t see that other people might make use of features that they didn’t need (and also put on show their ableist attitude).</p>
<p>This happens with almost everything, we all have a tendency to rubbish features and think we could all do a better job, when the reality is we probably couldn’t. Except when it comes to managing the England football team.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>For the past few weeks, I’ve been producing slop. Not because I want to. Merely because everyone tells me I must in order to succeed on the internet.</p>
<p>Content slop is a strange term, but it describes the mass-produced, often AI-generated, surface-level content that constitutes a large portion of the internet now. It has three characteristics, but I stick to <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/slop-void">Ryan Broderick&rsquo;s first outlining feature</a>, which states that “to the user, the viewer, the customer, it feels worthless.”</p>
<p>Anything made purely for internet points and offering no value whatsoever is slop. It constitutes a massive portion of YouTube, streaming apps, social media platforms, and unfortunately, a large portion of the web now. So why have I been creating it, you might ask? Well, because I wanted some of those sweet dopamine hits everyone craves, of course. While working to increase the level of my Instagram account after deleting it a couple of years ago, it&rsquo;s tough going, and every bit of advice on how to grow your account suggests you publish reels. So I began hating myself and producing slop.</p>
<p><img src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-07-22-at-10.34.11.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I couldn’t do it to myself for very long. Barely a few weeks of publishing meme-like reels led to thousands of views and loads of likes, which for some would be a considerable win. Yet, the metric I wanted to push, my follower count, barely moved. Views are worthless unless they lead to something: buying your product, visiting your links, or perhaps following your account. The percentage of people who take such actions is so minute that the old tricks do not work any more.</p>
<p><img src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/uploads/2024/cleanshot-2024-07-22-at-10.34.57.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Platforms like TikTok and Instagram only serve those who produce entertainment. They exist for no other reason than to serve you slop interlaced with adverts and keep you watching. They are self-serving companies that care about the creators only as much as they need to. Not only that, but they have a way of convincing us that they care about creators when, in fact, the only metric that matters is slop production. As long as you produce slop that can be served to other people, they can keep making money.</p>
<p>Granted, my slop experiment wasn’t done to the best of my abilities; my slop was particularly poor slop. Mosseri, head of Instagram, stated himself that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/14ip8y6/mosseri_states_that_if_your_reach_has_dropped_it/#lightbox">you&rsquo;re not entitled to exposure</a> and reach; you just need to produce different slop. Had I offered a bit more value to people, perhaps they would have followed me for more slop production, but I doubt it. I realised rapidly that modern social algorithms have removed the need to follow anyone to see the slop that resonates with you. So there’s no point in bothering after all.</p>

     <p>John Gruber joining <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/07/att_data_breach_rcs_ios">two unconnected things together</a> and predictably developing from it a pro apple stance (via <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/im-glad-iphones-are-getting-rcs/">Birchtree</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the argument against RCS is strong and simple: it doesn’t support end-to-end encryption. The only new messaging platforms that should gain any traction are those that not only support E2EE, but that require it. Messaging and audio/video calls should only work through E2EE. That’s true for iMessage and FaceTime.</p></blockquote>
<p>I try not to read, nor comment on, Daring Fireball things any more because the take from them is so clouded in pro-Apple rhetoric that it’s often difficult to see the wood for the trees. However, after Matts post about the article, I decided to read it for myself and boy what a weird take.</p>
<p>RCS is merely a step forward for SMS and MMS, it never promised encryption, and I have my doubts that any carrier would support it even if it did. Apple presently sticks to routing RCS through carrier defaults. Google offers encryption over RCS by <a href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/10252671?hl=en-GB#:~:text=When%20you%20message%20someone%20who,you%20and%20the%20other%20person.">turning them into Google Messages,</a> meaning “your chat conversations automatically upgrade to end-to-end encryption”. I am sure that Apple could offer something similar, but considering their RCS implementation is essentially an FU to the EU, they chose not to.</p>
<p>However, we are going off-topic a little. Whilst I agree with John’s opinion that any new implementation of messaging should be e2e encrypted, he completely skirts around the fact that Apple could offer this because it doesn’t fit into his narrative. Instead, he suggests sending all of your messaging through a third-party close system — mentioning WhatsApp specifically. Taking such a positive stance on privacy and then suggesting the use of Meta products is more than a little strange.</p>

     <p>Christopher Lawley got to talk to Jenny Chen and Ty Jordan about iPad note-taking and specifically math notes.</p>

<p>Whilst it is predictably a very reserved, PR focused chat, Chris always manages to demonstrate his excitement for iPad features and does an excellent job of walking through the features with them. The video is worth watching if you’re interested in the iPad or Apple at all, it almost gets me interested in the iPad again… almost.</p>

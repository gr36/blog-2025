  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I am not one to write about business. Not because I don’t think it’s valuable to have opinions about it, but just because I don’t think I have many important things to say. My working life thankfully has been pretty simple, and I am not about to pretend to have magic insights to improve yours. I do come across a certain type of person though and I would like to warn you against becoming one.</p><p>The busy fool is easy to spot. They are often very gifted in the position they are in, but need to lean on everyone else around them more than they should do. Their demeanour leads you in to the vicinity of the busy fool because they are always busy with something. It is only when you get closer to them that you realise that numerous things are going on, but very little is achieved.</p><p>There is very little that can be done to help this scourge of your business because they have very regularly worked their way into a more senior position. Unfortunately, this is the cause of their affliction, and their lack of output doesn’t seem to matter any longer. Without the clear indicators that come with lower positions, they have replaced productivity with busyness and imploded into themselves.</p><p>Implied stress from workload is all of their doing. You see, the busy fool is a business mime act. Displaying all the outside actions of achievement and high output, yet under the surface there is no substance to their bluster. Identifiable by last-minute preparations for every task, pleads for help on basic things they have no time to complete, and constant instance that they have too much to do.</p><p>Do not fall into the trap by convincing yourself you are productive when you are just busy.</p>

      <p>I am one of those people that constantly strives to do things better. Always looking out for tips that help get things done simpler, and also seeking simplifications to processes that <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/kia-kamgar/">Kia Kamgar</a> would be proud of. Yet, there are things that seem long-winded, perhaps a little messy, but just need to be left alone.</p><p>When looking for all these gains there is a tendency to go a little too far. You see tech bros and CEO’s trying far too hard to hack everything to find gains. Some which make perfect sense, shaving some time here and there, particularly in a busy life, pays for itself in a short period of time. However some are changed just for changing sake.</p><p>As Anna Winer puts it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_Valley_(memoir)">Uncanny Valley</a> “Reading wasn’t about mainlining information. The tech industry’s efficiency fetish was so dreary”. Some things just need to be slow and not the most efficient way of doing things. Yet provide the best return for your investment. Take reading for example, more and more services are sprouting up to <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/">cut all the corners</a> and give you the book in a faction of the time it takes to read. This might pay off for some, but hacking reading seems like something that wouldn’t be that useful.</p><p>The joy is <em>in</em> the reading. Absorbing the information at your pace, and thinking about things as you read them. Much like <a href="/2019/04/29/skipping-silence.html">trimming the silence from your podcasts </a>(don’t do that either) often it is reading between the lines and applying your experiences that provide the most feedback. I could have dictated this whole blog post instead of writing it out. Or perhaps recored it as a voice note. Yet, the process of writing it out, editing and trimming along with everything else that goes into it is as enjoyable as the result.</p><p>Simplifying processes saves not only time and effort, but typically money. Meaning, you win on all fronts and improve your life for the better. However, this doesn’t apply to everything, you can’t hack some things, and they are just better left alone.</p>

      <p>There have already been many words written about the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/considering-jumping-the/">walled gardens</a> of tech companies. Usually reserved for talk about Apple and its tight grip, it’s also a long-term aim of almost every company. Build a reliance on your company that runs too deep to change, and you will have a customer for life but perhaps a frustrated one.</p><p>You can achieve this in many ways. You can’t simply build a product that is so good that others pale in comparison because, eventually, someone else will either copy or overtake you. There needs to be a grip that keeps a customer, and the strongest grip in technology circles is to provide everything your customers may ever need. There is no denying this approach when I think about my purchases and reliance on Apple, but it isn’t just about what they sell.</p><p>The reality is, for me at least, the premium I pay for the products I buy from Apple is a worthy exchange for the service I get. Not only is it a well-rounded software and hardware experience, unlike any other I have experienced. The purchasing service and the after sales support is unmatched. I can’t find another company that provides me with a complete wrap around service that Apple does, and although it feels trapping at times, it gives me a huge amount of confidence.</p><p>I appreciate the level of service that Apple gives in retail is not as good as it used to be. Some interactions feel more like a sales pitch than a support visit. With that said I have experienced, in the past Samsung and more <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/nordictrack-cross-trainer-resistance-too-high-heres-the-fix/">recently Nordictrack</a>, customer service once I have made a significant purchase and nothing seems to live up.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that I cannot be critical of the things I use, nor does it mean I am not open to new experiences. It simply means that I am aware of what keeps me using Apple products, and it isn’t just the fact I am trapped by services. App stores and competition of services doesn’t really bother me, but a company I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/where-to-put/">put my investment</a> in providing good service does — as such I am, unfortunately, stuck!</p>

      <p>There is a tale to be told here. One that having a blog sometimes feels a little like having an unpaid job. A job that you feel like you should be doing better and more often than you are, but I reality you don’t owe anyone that obligation.</p><p>The feelings of owing the people who read and subscribe to my blog at least some kind of activity have been circling for years. In 2018, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-was-going/">I struggled with the motivation</a> to do it, and despite improving my drive to publish, and even picking up <a href="https://thedent.net/the-denties2021/">an award</a> for doing so, the motivation still comes and goes.</p><p>Despite my desire to push things out, I still think the peaks and troughs of publishing just need to be ridden. There is little point going through the motions for little reward, I’d rather wait until I have <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/something-to-say/">something to say</a> rather than waste your time. The constant changing requirements in my life mean that for long periods I don’t have the energy remaining to catch up on the latest news. Despite now doing <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/">one of my own</a>, my podcast consumption remains low, and almost every article I read and want to make a comment on I do so in <a href="https://getmatter.app/gr36/">Matter</a>.</p><p>Having different outlets is great, but doesn’t get away from the fact I want to write more things. My desire to write and publish never leaves me, but the motivation or time to do so frequently does. Life has this funny way of getting in the way of everything else that you would like to do doesn’t it. By the time the day is done, I have done too much staring at a screen that even a little while longer to bang some keys seems like too much.</p><p>With all this said, I shouldn’t feel like I need to. There is no reason for me to worry about those that enjoy my things because they won't stop. They may just be a little delayed while I attempt to write something.</p>

      <p>Unless you’ve been living under a technology rock, or simply don’t care, you can’t escape European legislation trying to cub technology companies. Investigating, charging and regulating the world's largest and most influential companies can be tough, but they seem to finally be getting a handle on things. Yet, what seems easy could be impossibly hard to achieve.</p><p>The latest round of legislation by the EU, termed the Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims to <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2022/03/26/will-the-digital-markets-act-help-europe-breed-digital-giants">level playing fields</a> dominated by a few companies. Despite containing many well-educated and thoughtful changes to current acts, including increasing the responsibilities of companies deemed large enough to be “gatekeepers”, the focus has been on messaging interoperability. The ability to send a message from one app to another.</p><p>Make sense in theory, doesn’t it. The EU want my messaging app to be able to send a message to anyone else's messenger app, and not be locked into using one companies service. People have long talked about iMessage lock in, which in Europe is substituted by WhatsApp lock in (which thankfully is available on every platform). Messaging should function as a universal or accepted standard. Take email for example, I can send the same message to another email address regardless if that is a gmail, hotmail or custom domain. The EU argue messaging should be the same, a user should not be restricted to what service they want to use.</p><p>Messaging is different though. It’s messy, controlled by big players and tech giants that either start up a service or buy a service that already has a large user base. With this kind of control comes benefits. Unlike phone calls, emails and sms messages that are all interoperable, the best messaging apps are encrypted — often end to end. So, interoperability is essentially impossible.</p><p>Perhaps that’s the point. The EU powers know that interoperability should be easy but is, in fact, a privacy breaking ruling of epic proportion. We already know that the powers in charge don’t like encryption, they love snooping on your information and arguing it's for your protection. They know that the average Joe won't care and only half understand the issues at hand. Instead, arguing for the ability to be able to message their friend on WhatsApp with their Telegram account.</p><p>Interoperability and big tech giants are not the real target, your privacy is, and they want the right to snoop on you. Sure, messaging <em>should</em> work like email, but the governments of your country made a world that requires your messages to be encrypted and are now breaking it with something ‘simple’.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>As excited as I was to unpack my new purchase as soon as it arrived, that was all dispersed the first time I used my Nordictrack SE7i Cross Trainer. The resistance felt far too high, and I puffed and panted my way through 15 minutes despite being used to doing an hour on others.</p>
<p>I put this down to being a little unfit, or maybe I just needed to get used to this specific version. However, the shine was well and truly dulled by my first experience. Thankfully, for my sanity, I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nordictrack/comments/g8iuev/resistance_became_way_too_high/">wasn’t alone</a>. Several people were having the same issue on brand-new machines, some of which returned their purchases because of this. To say the Nordictrack customer service doesn’t have a great reputation is an understatement — not to worry, here’s the fix to the resistance being too high on your equipment.</p>
<p>After watching <a href="https://youtu.be/B1J_i3k55Es">this video</a> to see how things worked, it’s easy to see there is some adjustment to the tension management cable. Numerous people have done this and made walk through video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ2D806K1V0">their version</a>, but thankfully my Nordictrack SE7i or S700 wasn’t nearly as complicated.</p>
<p>You will need a screwdriver and small spanner. Remember, you do this at completely your own risk, and keep in mind this may void your warranty.</p>
<h2 id="1-remove-the-footplate">1 Remove the footplate</h2>
<p>Four screws at the back of the machine will mean you can remove the foot that the machine will stand on if you fold it up.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1508c9bc61.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="2-remove-the-surround">2 Remove the Surround</h2>
<p>Two more screws to remove on the top above the footplate.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b90c98a6c3.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Once removed, you can remove the curved surround from the back of the machine.</p>
<h2 id="3-find-and-adjust-the-cable">3 Find and adjust the cable</h2>
<p>One removed, you will be able to see inside the read of the Nordictrack Cross Trainer. Look down on the machine’s right-hand side, you will see the silver cable join that you need to adjust.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3b94a01661.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Mine was finger tight, but you may need a small spanner to make adjust the resistance. To accomplish this, first loosen the smaller nut away from the longer piece. Then you can adjust the longer piece to your desired effect. Unscrewing makes the resistance decrease, tightening makes the resistance increase.</p>
<p>For more information, watch the below section of video.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card">[embed]https://youtube.com/watch?v=B1J_i3k55Es&amp;start=100&amp;feature=oembed[/embed]</figure>
<p>The advantage of not taking lots of the machine apart is you can now test and readjust as required. Mine required lots of loosening. iFit recommends a starting point in their workouts of resistance level 7, but your ability will vary.</p>

      <p>It’s very unlike the world of Twitter to lose its mind when the company changes something about its app or service. More words were written about the move to <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself">240 characters</a> than the world needed, but most users just get used to the noise. Some throw all the toys out the pram and quit. Perhaps move to Mastodon for an hour and come back, but as a Twitter developer, you have to expect the outrage when you mess with the timeline.</p><p>For some strange reason, Twitter have been obsessed with forcing users, or at least fooling them, to use their <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-timeline">‘home’ feed</a> for a very long time. One not composed of reverse chronological tweets. Instead, filled with spammy content to boost engagement, 7 different tweets that someone you forgot you followed liked, and random topics someone somewhere decided you might not hate.</p><p>This week was no different. The big brains at the blue bird decided instead of being able to tap an icon and switch between the way your timeline displays, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/twitter-just-made-a-big-change-to-our-timelines-and-i-hate-it">both need to be pinned side by side</a>.</p><p>There’s no denying that, when social networks get to a certain size, some algorithmic sorting and pruning is recommended. Simply so users can deal with the sheer value of information. It’s simply a <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-problem-of/">product of scale</a> that needs to addressed at some point or another. With that said, Twitter seems to be a different breed of social network. It doesn’t fit the mould of others (with perhaps an exception also made for Instagram) and needs to hang on to its free flowing, constantly updating nature.</p><p>Twitter has been the birthplace of some of the best movements to be enabled by social media, and indeed some of the worst issues plaguing society. Both ends of this scale are caused and enabled by an always on chronological timeline. Perhaps something does need to be done, but sorting a Twitter feed by a ranking algorithm is not it. Boosting posts by popularity could potentially lead to a much worse place.</p><p>If there is one thing that Twitter users engage with is drama, and surfacing the posts that are engaged with the most is just asking for trouble. This is without mentioning that a move towards algorithmic sorting is simply not what users want. Thankfully the rollback came <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/twitter-finally-rolls-back-another-terrible-feature-in-new-speed-record">quicker than I expected</a>, but no doubt is to be followed up by a move similarly deaf to its users desires.</p><p>Algorithms, machine learning and development smarts improve numerous tech issues, but Twitter is not one of them. To kill the reverse chronological feed is to kill something at the very core of its nature. Perhaps one day, hopefully when it is not too late, Twitter will listen.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>If the last two years(ish) has taught me anything, it’s that I love working from home. I have been happier, able to get more work done and also be more engaged with home life than ever before. There are a few things I miss from working with people in person, but on the whole I love it — but I’m lonely.</p><p>I am not sure what sparked me thinking about the interaction I have, of which I do have quite a lot, but the realisation is that I have very few friends. Don’t get me wrong, I have people in my life that I care about outside my family, but I don’t have any close-knit friends like I used to when I was a kid.</p><p>I’ve given up attempting to make them too because it’s almost impossible as an adult.</p><p>I don’t even know where to start, I miss the times when my motivation to be friends was that the person lived vaguely close to me. Shared similar interests as me, or just went to the same school. Whereas now, everyone I speak to has busy lives, and we all carve very little time for just being friendly.</p><p>Unfortunately, it could be a major cause of depression. Certainly, the root cause outlined in a large portion of <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_this_could_be_why_you_re_depressed_or_anxious?language=en">Johann Hari TED talk</a> is this lack of connection I feel. Online tools, and smartphone are great, they give me at least a sense of what I am missing, but can’t replace real connection. There is no excuse not to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/reaching-out/">reach out</a> to those in your life, but nothing replaces an in-person chat, or <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/missing-a-good/">a hug</a>.</p><p>There is an inbuilt, perhaps masculine, trait I have to accept that I don’t need or won’t ever have friends. It leads to feeling further away from the people I am forced to interact with because they are in my circle, but I really want to try. I just don’t know where to start. Do all adults feel like this?</p>

<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>It has been a long time since a new Nexus has been usable for the general population, two years ago LG produced arguably the most successful Nexus so far. A 5 inch screened device, with good specs that was affordable to the masses. For the first time it was a phone you could recommend and you actually saw Nexus’ in use on the street.</p>
<p>Now there is debate over what the Nexus line is, but Google effectively does whatever they like and chose to supersize a Moto x and release a 6 inch phone. Partly to keep with the sequential naming scheme and partly to see what they could do with such a massive screen. The answer for many was nothing and it struggle for sales as much as users did to reach the top of it’s massive screen.</p>
<p>A complete change of plan this year as Google have released two phones, an Nexus and a Nexus plus if you will. Giving Chinese OEM Huawei a chance to produce a better 6 inch phone, and (as we have here) LG another crack at its beloved 5 inch Nexus — the result being the Nexus 5x. A tongue in cheep name for what is essentially a small spec bump on it’s last Nexus.</p>
<h2>Spec Race</h2>
<p>Specs have be come a bone of contention for some, but we are finally getting to a point where all spec sheets give reasonably the same results. The Nexus 5x sits in the sweet spot for most users, the 5.2inch 1080p IPS screen (423ppi) leaves little bezel at the sides. Meaning just over 70% of the front of the phone isn’t covered by glass, so it is almost impossible to tell when the screen starts and ends.</p>
<p>The majority of the remaining 30% is dominated by the two front facing grilles. These certainly give the impression of stereo speakers a la the Nexus 6. However this is only illusion, as the speaker is behind only the bottom grille, with the top on being for call audio only. Although does help give a very balanced look to the front of the phone which has been lacking from previous Nexus phones and makes the phone appear very premium.</p>
<p>Sadly that premium look is in appearance only, as the phone body is made entirely from plastic that will feel familiar for users of the old device. It still maintains some of the same grippy feel of the last Nexus 5, and unfortunately very similar creaks and cracks from the plastic while actually using the phone. The handset styling is sleek and understated as with every Nexus device and could easily fit in any situation, but during use things like the vibration motor make the phone feel and sound very cheep indeed.</p>
<p>With that said you are using a phone that is ‘only’ £299 (when purchased from Carphone warehouse) so some compromises should be expected. For that price you are also getting a phone with Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 (MSM8992) the Hexacore processor that has mediated the disaster that is the Snapdragon 810. Coupled with a somewhat limited 2gb of RAM, but it does give a smooth and quick user experience.</p>
<p>There is one new hardware addition, a small ring on the back of the device you could be forgiven for dismissing as decoration. It outlines the finger print scanner, placed approximately where your index finger rests during use. A top finger print scanner it is too, fast and accurate and a pleasure to use. It takes only a few days to get used to the placement and will be particular useful for those wanting extra security without entering a pin on every unlock. A quick top on the circle wakes and unlocks the phone with ease.</p>
<p>In side by side tests the scanner was as accurate and for the majority quicker than the Touch ID sensor on the new iPhone 6s. Which just as with Apples new handset almost renders the lock screen useless unless you unlock the old fashioned way by using the power button. However you wont want to as all three of the buttons placed down the right hand side of the device leave a lot to be desired, feeling mushy and sub par to say the least.</p>
<h2>Long Life</h2>
<p>The 5.2 screen has allowed LG to squeeze in a slightly larger battery than the last iteration, a 2700mah battery that should see it through a day of use according to Google. Unfortunately this is the one and only area that may sway a few people to opt for something different. In real world usage all day life is possible — but not guaranteed, if you are a heavy user you are going to struggle to see 7pm without at least a little range anxiety.</p>
<p>However for lighter users the battery life is superb, using Marshmallows ‘doze mode’ the phone blocks wake locks and other battery drains, backing off from system tasks the longer it is left. Meaning standby battery drain is dramatically reduced without compromising important notification or messages while the phone is sat idle on a table etc. Unfortunately this is not optimised for those times the phone is sat in your pocket, so doze is only really useful if you place you phone somewhere when not in use.</p>
<p>There are also lots of battery optimisation built into Marshmallow such as optimising app usage to prolong battery use and an ambient display each time you nudge the phone. All in an attempt to avoid waking the phone up to se if you have any notifications. So in reality the 2700mah battery should do better than it does, but Google service are again the largest battery drain. If you use things like Google Now and location services you are going to struggle being away from a charger for long periods of time.</p>
<p>For those times you are caught short (which you will be) the Nexus 5x comes complete with new USB type C charging cable, which is great. No more fumbling or having to turn the cable around 3 times to get it to fit the bottom of the phone, but a massive pain when trying to buy some spare cables. Bare in mind also that the supplied cable with both of these phones is USB type C on both ends, so you wont be plugging it into your computer without an adapter or unless you have a Chromebook Pixel.</p>
<p>Once plugged in the phone charges incredibly fast, going from less than 10% to 100% faster than anything I have experienced — and a quick 10 minute charge will add another 4 hours of battery life to a dying phone.</p>
<h2>Snap happy</h2>
<p>With the build quality and the battery life being little improved from the last Nexus 5 its a refreshing change to not have to also moan about the camera performance. Previous iterations have not had bad cameras per se, but have made little use of the sensor with image processing and software benefits. Fortunately, at fourth time of promising Google have delivered a very capable couple of handsets. They have included the same sensor into both new handsets, a 12.3 mp Sony sensor and optimised it to the best of their ability.</p>
<p>Shots are not going to blow anyone away, but for the first time they are not an embarrassment either. They at least can hold a candle to some of the best on the market, and in the ball park of those from LG’s own G4 and Samsung’s S6. In good lighting shots are crisp, with colours are bright and vivid. Comparison to those of the S6 or iPhone 6s is more down to personal preference, sitting somewhere between the S6 bright colours and the more muted ones of the iPhone.</p>
<p>The biggest let down is still focus, and was a particular bone of contention when taking some pictures. Needing a touch on the screen to manual focus or a few shots to get it correct. Something that is a huge let down when both the Lg G4 and the S6 do such a great job, not to mention the lack of manual controls from Googles camera app. None of the issues above are major and could be updated with a point release, but the camera app is slow and look outdated when others are so quick and easy to use.</p>
<p>Low light usually lets any non optimised sensor down, and it creeps into some shots from the 5x. The lack of OIS does show in quite a few of the shots, leading to some blur and noise in lower light shots. Particular when the light is fading as this is exaggerated by the muted yellows and oranges in the images. It very difficult to show sample shots as they are never how you are really going to use you phone, but there is a gallery of images below of my walk around the park!</p>
<h2>Android and You</h2>
<p>With all that said you can praise the hardware as much as you like but heres the thing, its Android that is the let down. I still really like Android, like really really. However I think I liked the idea more than the actual OS, the young upstart against the behemoth that is Apple. Except they are both made by huge corporations and both have the same ends in mind. Its all about the revenue but with completely different ways to get it.</p>
<p>Android and iOS both have completely different angles in approaching the end user and earning that revenue. Apple charges a premium for the phone, that is the only place it is available and then provides the user with the best experience possible. Whereas Android makes its OS available everywhere, handset makers make no money from the sale, and then hope to makes a much money as possible while the phone is in use.</p>
<p>Android still feels like children’s software trying to live up to being a serious OS, its fun and friendly but could occasionally put on its big boy pants and play grownups. Gone is the hollo blue, but it is replaced by every primary colour in tones that could damage the retina. Unfortunately for the Nexus, it also features the Google logo in multicoloured glory right on the home screen — as it runs Googles version of Android and its more Google like than it has ever been.</p>
<p>There is an unspoken of pressure to hate anything produced by the other side, an unwritten law that you are not allowed to like or even appreciate both Android and iOS. It is unfair to compare the Nexus 5x to the iPhone 6s as the handset is half the price, but that is where most people are going to want it to be. The best of Google vs the best of Apple, perhaps the Nexus 6p is a better comparison — but both are ultimately let down by Android.</p>
<p>I know thats an unfavourable thing to say, Android 100% has its advantages — you can mould and shape Android exactly as you like. Change default apps, launchers all sorts of things, but Android apps fail in comparison to their Apples counter parts even when developed by the same companies. The iOS Twitter app is light years above the hot mess that is the Android app — yes you can change the default app but general users will relate official apps to Android straight away.</p>
<p>When the applications in use reflect so heavily on peoples perception of the OS and therefore the hardware its time for Google to put a foot down. Billions of apps make little difference when only a small percentage are any good, and show the full ability of Android. Material design has helped to improve things, but when Google themselves show inconstancy amongst their own apps how can you expect others to follow. Come on developers make the Android what it could be and take over the world.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I don’t want to dismiss a Nexus device that holds so many found memories for me, but Im afraid I just have to. Each and every time I picked up the device it felt good in the hand and took amazing photos, but Android is just not going to win over anyone. The 5x will stay with me, but to occasionally test Android because it is such a good phone for the price — nothing more.</p>
<p>When so much of an Android phone review is useless now, there are only so many words you can use to say the same thing. Readers will scroll down to the camera and battery sections and thats it. It has a great camera, let down a little by a rubbish camera app, and it has a good battery let down by a battery draining OS. One Android phone is the same as the next one by and large, spec sheets mean little above a smooth working device — and this one is great for £299.</p>
<p>If you are an Android user, and looking to upgrade then it is a worthy contender — one of the very best on the market. Even more so for the price you pay. Google finally made some great hardware with its partners, but is let down by the app market not showing Android to the best of its ability. With a heavy heart the Nexus 5x is a budget best buy but nothing more.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Glass was possibly the most polarising gadget in recent memory. Many Explorers argued that the device was a great aid, a fantastic device and should be excepted due to reasons that don’t really sit well with me. I just don’t get it. I didn’t when Google tried the cyborg angle with Google Glass – and Snapchat won’t change that.<br />
<p>With that said I don’t understand many things in technology – VR and Pokémon Go included. Thats not to say they might not appeal to many people, but a computer on your face worries me the most. Not least because I really would like to keep my life to myself.</p></p>
<h2><strong>My Life</strong></h2>
<p>There is already a swirling need for us to document every minute of every day – just in case other people might find it vaguely interesting. Coupled with the many people that go much further and stage life events just for the ‘clicks’ or ‘views’ or other measurable thing dependant on your platform of choice.</p>
<p>During a recent concert I lost count of the amount of people that watched the majority of the event on their phone screen while recording. I’m not sure what these people feel about events afterwards, but it must be much more hollow than my memories of enjoying the event.</p>
<p>Our life and memories should be short, fuzzy, and open to interpretation by our feelings. Thats just the way a Human experience has been for thousands of years. Sharing moments with loved ones is one thing but saving everything online is another. Humans just are not made to remember everything; we are fragile and complex individuals with different abilities.</p>
<p>The Black Mirror episode “The entire history of you” hits at a hyper extension of these types of recording device. Unfortunately, the dystopian future predicted in each episode is well inside the realms of possibility – our brains are already much shallower than they used to be, could they be useless soon? Do we eventually have to accept computers and recording devices into every part of our lives, will nothing be truly private again?</p>
<h2><strong>Privacy Push</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve ready lots of commenters say that these new Snap Spectacles are much better than Glass. However, despite many of the same arguments before society decided Glass wasn’t ok. That shouldn’t change with these new inventions just because they have a light on them!</p>
<p>The fact is I just don’t want to live in a world where I could be on camera at any point in the day. I can tell when people are taking pictures with any type of camera, including a smartphone. I don’t care how careful you are, I can see you creep shooting people on the train you weirdo! I don’t want to have to worry about spy glasses to.</p>
<p>Edit: Saying it shouldn’t be an issue unless I have something to hide? Do you have the same argument for Edward Snowdon?</p>

<p>When colleagues tell me Twitter is failing, I am dismissive. When websites tell me they are not doing very well I am equally unbelieving. Simply because Twitter makes $595million instead of the $608million expected makes no difference to me or to any of it’s users.</p>
<p>Something is only really wrong with Twitter when you experience it for yourself. Usage <em>is</em> declining, new users <em>are</em> slowing and that <em>is</em> an issue for current users. The real problem is it is almost impossible to understand why.</p>
<h1>Tweeting Users</h1>
<p>Watch the TV for any length of time and you are inundated by hashtags and little Twitter logos so you can ‘join in the conversation’ online. Right down to the news and weather you are treated with their @ so you can read everything they have to say. At a cursory glance you could be forgiven for thinking that Twitter is filled full of every celebrity imaginable and meaning full debate.</p>
<p>Yet finding and keeping new users is Twitters number one problem. New users more in tune with ‘friending’ and clicking thumbs up usage declines because Twitter is simply not Facebook. This quarter Twitter added 5 million new users, building that to <a href="http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/march-2013-by-the-numbers-a-few-amazing-twitter-stats/">310million users that actually use the platform</a>.</p>
<p>Not an insignificant amount of people, but numbers that are dwarfed by the big blue F’s <a href="https://zephoria.com/top-15-valuable-facebook-statistics/">1.65 billion monthly</a> active users. When advertising is your only way of monetising, attracting brands to a platform a fifth of the size is tough. Yet they still come and advertise, sponsoring tweets and interrupting your timeline on a regular basis. Unfortunately the lack of users and leverage has been a hinderance to Twitter being able to develop its own ad platform, but not to show ads.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fav-and-RT-based serotonin reward system unintentionally built into Twitter also has the side effect of forcing introverts to obsessively write pithy jokes for huge audiences for free, day in and day out. – Jon Hendren</p></blockquote>
<h2>Follow Me</h2>
<p>What is leaving the platform a long way behind Facebook is frustrating even a long time Twitter users, and thats discoverability. New people to follow are becoming hard to find amongst a sea of bots, brands and buffoons. Once the social media of choice for anyone that wanted to engage with fans, Twitter becoming instead filed with accounts run by PR reps and brands.</p>
<p>Twitter is well aware of its issues, I am sure they read the news. Even Jack Dorsey himself <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/06/02/jack-dorsey-twitters-stagnation/">admitted at the Code conference</a> that at times twitter can be confusing and alienating. Its only option so far has been moments.</p>
<p>What are all of these users fed up of? Harassment? That certainly must have a massive impact especially to some users. In fact <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/05/26/every-10-seconds-someone-on-twitter-calls-a-woman-a-slut-or-whore/">think tank Demos found that every 10 seconds, someone on Twitter calls a woman</a> a ‘slut’ or ‘whore’! That is from female and male users alike, harassment is a network wide issue.</p>
<p>Much like many before me, I am actually starting to think Twitter <em>does</em> have a problem. What I don’t understand is how! Jon Henderson summed it up perfectly so I will leave you with his words.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s amazing to think that a company whose content is provided for free, who gets free mass advertising from basically every angle, and whose only real responsibility is to Not Break Itself can’t figure out how to be sustainable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Join the conversation and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gr36">follow me</a>.</p>

<p>I have been listening to podcasts for many years now. It’s kind of a natural progression from talk radio, but you can listen to whatever you like. However still lots of people still don’t know about podcasts, so the platform is always going to get bigger.</p>
<p>They have been around for a few years, but now is the real boom time of podcasting. With the great thing being the barrier to entry being more easily available than ever. Sure there are some big players, but lots and lots of individuals that make and publish them online – and to be honest it’s the little ones where you really find some brilliant work.</p>
<h2>The Bar is low</h2>
<p>Here’s the thing, I have read recently from a couple of places but most notably from the creator of the ‘bumpers’ app – that podcasts are hard to make. Which is annoying because they really aren’t, you can do it all with free software and a bit of time. A ‘podcast’ is just an RSS feed that links to and audio file after all – how simple is that!</p>
<p>For the last 2/3 years I have been appearing on all kinds of podcasts, and over the last year begun to publish my own. I really didn’t realise how quick and simple it could be. I currently produce 2 podcasts a week over at mobiletechtalk.co.uk about technology and you can start too.</p>
<p>• There are loads of free audio recording tools out there, all out team currently use audacity to locally record all audio. This is then ‘mixed’ together later, because ours is conversation based.<br />
• For ‘mixing’, I now use Logic Pro which is an expensive bit of kit. However for a long time I used GarageBand which comes free with all of Apples computers. If you are a Windows user you can use Audacity to edit and remove any mistakes you have made really easily.<br />
• We record all our shows through YouTube live streaming, which is completely free to use. This makes recording even easier if you fancy being on camera too. You can download the recording afterwards and convert this to audio using audacity, you might even make some money in YouTube views too!</p>
<p>• Hosting can be done free of charge on sites like Soundcloud or if you want something a bit extra, very cheaply via libsyn. My total hosting fees for two shows is a lot less than you might think!<br />
• Then you just have to spread you RSS feed as wide as possible, which is an hours work maximum. Submit it to iTunes, Stitcher and Pocketcasts to cover the main platforms, and many more places will pick it up on their own.<br />
• Artwork might take you a bit of time, but consider that you can submit simply a photo you have taken.</p>
<p>The time you spend editing depends on the level on perfection you want, quite often normal conversation is the best thing so a few slips ups are nothing to worry about.<br />
Got a free afternoon? You can easily knock out a podcast and sort out your hosting and distribution. That’s hardly a massive barrier to entry is it? If you need a hand with anything there is a huge network of websites out there to help have a quick Google. Feel free to drop me a line if you need my help and share your podcast with me.</p>

<p>I guess we are all too busy deciding if to leave the EU or if to stay in. Or maybe loosing all our marbles deciding which Oneplus ‘peer’ to give a review device too. However the Labour backed investigatory powers bill has been passed by UK parliament while no one was paying attention.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, Labour pledged its support for the proposed investigatory powers bill leaving it with 444 votes in support and only 69 in opposition. The controversial bill will now progress to the House of Lords for consideration. Meaning the governments plans to ramp up its surveillance of UK citizens is very much a go!</p>
<p>The SNP, Liberal Democrats and the Green Party are still apposed to the dubbed ‘snoopers charter’. Unfortunately Labour support was gained due to the third draft meeting Labour parties Keir Starmer’s ‘significant demands’.</p>
<p>In reality Labour have already supported the new bill, which significantly increases the surveillance levels of UK citizens that are completely innocent. So the bill sails through with no real opposition, despite the government already believing it has much of the powers already.</p>
<p>In 2007, UK spies drew up secret plans to snoop on the activities of “every visible user on the internet”. UK state lawyers admitted six years later that the number of people targeted was an “infinite list”. — The National</p>
<h2>Section 94</h2>
<p>In fact GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 have been using section 94 of the Telecommunications Act to collect bulk surveillance on the whole of the population for quite some time. As far back as 2004 GCHQ have been circumventing the current UK surveillance laws with little to no oversight.</p>
<p>Bulk surveillance is something many have long suspected, but arguably we would know nothing about the level of intrusion had it not been for Edward Snowdon.<br />
The bulk powers are available and being exercised at the moment under the existing arrangements, by and large — there are some exceptions — therefore what this bill does is put them onto a statutory footing with proper safeguards. — Keir Starmer, Shaddow home office minister.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that GCHQ are already operating with arguably similar powers, that is not the say that the ‘Snooper’s Charter’ should not have come up against severe opposition from all citizens world wide. Evidence already exists that information was accessed by Scottish police and shared with American organisation despite the techniques used being outlawed in the US.</p>
<p>In fact more questions are being asked of the Scottish police than of our own Government. The SNP home affairs spokeswoman Joanna Cherry has already expressed her delight at independent studies into the data collecting powers of the Government. Refusing to support the proposed bill because so many opposition view points and proposed amendments have been ignored. A movement that has increased since more evidence revealed the extent of data access by the Scottish Police.</p>
<h2>The Snoopers Charter</h2>
<p>The bill is only inches away from bringing into law a provision of the interception of communications, equipment interference and the acquisition and retention of communications data. Drastically increasing the level of data that can be retained by the security agencies, but also the level of data kept by private companies.</p>
<p>Passages in the bill will force companies such as Apple and Whatsapp to alter encryption used to give security services access to all communication. As well as all your internet connection records would be collected by service providers and kept for up to a year without reason or suspicion of criminal activity.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is time we stopped worrying about the new mobile phones on the horizon, or the latest reality TV rubbish and become outspoken over the government altering the way in which we can use the internet and intercepting all our communication. If you want to find out how you are going to be harmed by this bill, read a brief overview here.</p>

     <p>The constant need to make smartphones as thin and light as possible has made them fragile. So anti ‘lifeproof’ in fact that you have no choice but to put them into a case. Some manufactures are making their phones waterproof, but they still don’t survive a fall if the worst happens. Thats where X-Doria comes in, a long time producer of tough cases, with the Defence H2O it makes your phone waterproof too.</p><h1 id="defence-h2o-overview">Defence H2O Overview</h1><p>The X-Doria Defence H20 Waterproof Protective Cover Case that I tested is for the iPhone 6/6s. X-Doria want you to be able to take your phone everywhere by making their Defence H2O case waterproof, snow proof, dirt proof and drop proof. That’s a lot of proofs, but can the case really protect my phone from anything?</p><blockquote><em><em>Jump in the puddles, dance in the rain, swim in the ocean! Don’t let the fear of soaking your iPhone stop you from enjoying your life. With X-Doria Defence H2O, savour every moment without the fear of drowning your device.</em></em></blockquote><p>The case can be bought from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/X-Doria-Defence-Waterproof-Protective-iPhone/dp/B0187LRV6E" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Amazon in the UK</a>, and also this give you a heavy discount. Taking the cost down from the £59.99 RRP to £34.26 for the black or £47.71 for the white version we tested. All of these prices may vary though and are correct at the time of review.</p><h1 id="design">Design</h1><p>With any drop proof case you are always expecting it to really ruin the design of your phone. Although this isn’t the smallest case in the world, it is surpassingly thinner that expected. Leaving the iPhone still easily pocketable, and adding loads of grip to the phone which is a really bonus with the iPhone 6 being so slippery. For extra reassurance there is even a lanyard in the box.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/91ac831360.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="660" height="400" /></figure><p>The design uses a bumper around the sides that ‘exceeds military standards’ in drop tests of over 2m onto concrete, complimented by an almost perfectly clear polycarbonate back. So the Apple logo and the iPhone tramp stamp can still be proudly on show, but more importantly it still shows your colour of handset. Meaning your choice of Space grey, Silver or either Golds are not hidden away like many other cases.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/46055539df.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="660" height="330" /></figure><p>The bumper also covers all of the buttons to keep it nice and watertight, but doesn’t loose any of the reassuring ‘click’ when pressing. They do however need a little extra force to press them down, but I have had a much worse experience from much smaller cases. The bottom is covered by a rubber flap which plugs the headphone and charging port, allowing them to be used when required, but doing so obviously removes all of the ‘proofness’ highlighted above.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/e9932fbe93.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="660" height="330" /></figure><p>The Defence H2O also covers the screen with an inbuilt protector. It is surprisingly thick with a small gap between the cover and phone screen. Glare in direct sunlight is almost removed, but at the expense of viewing the screen is sometime slightly inhibited in some instances due to the thickens of the cover. Thankfully there are no issues with the touch sensitivity nor the Touch ID sensor.</p><h1 id="usage">Usage</h1><p>I am a big believer in <a href="https://amzn.to/2fL0SJ6" rel="external noopener noreferrer">smartphone</a> cases, with my iPhone spending most of its life tucked inside the official leather case. What that doesn’t give me however is any protection, well against anything really. When our smartphones are now our lives why not get some protection when you need it. The X-Doria Defence H20 Waterproof Protective Cover Case is so easy to get on an off again, if you’re even half active this is the case you will need on stand by.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/b2045139d3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="660" height="400" /></figure><p>In fact with the case only bumping the weight of an iPhone 6 to 176g, you may find yourself using it for all sorts of situations. When enjoying some craft time with the kids I didn’t need to worry about putting my phone out the way. Or equally when bathing the kids or even when washing up, I had zero phone worry at all. Remember those times when anyone could be dunked into the swimming pool at any time? Those times return when your phone has protection this good!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/acfb9e9e40.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="660" height="400" /></figure><p>When using the X-Doria Defence H20 your phone can be immersed in water at a depth over 2m for an hour. I am not sure what you would be doing to need such a long time, but it’s reassuring to know you’re covered. I think more than this though it makes your phone life proof, free from the worry over not just water but also dust and dirt. It is a must for almost every user even just for occasional use you are out and about.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/95d2487b81.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="660" height="400" /></figure><h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2><p>With the only downside being the cost, at an RRP of £59.99 it is more expensive that you might want to spend. Particularly for an occasional use case. However weigh this up against the cost of a replacement handset and its excellent value.</p><p>Is this case for everyone? No – if you live a life of office work and not much else then the Defence H2O really isn’t for you. However if like me, your life is filled with kids, sports and being anywhere near water keep one of these on stand by.</p>

    <time datetime="2016-06-01 23:00:00 &#43;0000">01 Jun 2016</time>
  </div>
  </div>
<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>No it has nothing to do with radio waves, magnetic fields, or any other obvious way we thought technology could kill us. It’s getting to your body in a very slow, stealthy way and you won’t even realise it. What’s more, new evidence claims that it doesn’t matter how healthy you are for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>All this health kick from Apple, Google et al. is all well and good but it doesn’t help the fact that technology is helping to secretly shorten your life by making you sedentary. I bet you wouldn’t even know it would you? Lifting weights a couple of times a week, even a jog on the weekends. Unfortunately, current research suggests even that doesn’t make a difference.</p>
<h2><strong>Insert Dramatic Music</strong></h2>
<p>Now technological advances are not the big bad wolf here, they have enabled our lives to be much easier, more enjoyable, and much safer. What is the real issue is the cultural shift that’s been enabled and sometime encouraged by Silicon Valley’s explosion. Technological advancements are the single underlying factor that has made humans less active in their lives.</p>
<p>This is most apparent whilst working; jobs are much more sedentary. These ‘sedentary types’ of jobs have increased by 83% since 1950 (American Heart Association). It’s no coincidence as the increase in technology and computing available in the workplace started in the 50’s. We are not just talking about computers, however the strange correlation happened around 1951 with the first commercially successful electronic computer, UNIVAC. There has also been a decrease in manual jobs due to the robotisation of many manufacturing and production lines.</p>
<h2><strong>Parked At The Office</strong></h2>
<p>According to research by Sanlam Private Investments, those of us with an ‘office job’ spend up to five years of our lives at a desk. With most spending anywhere up to 8 hours a day seated, other than the occasional trip to the printer or out for lunch. This only continues at clocking off time, spending anything up to 2 hours on public transport or driving. You can relax when you get home though, to our modern luxurious house filled with entertainment to keep you nice and relaxed seated.</p>
<p>The normal day is now so inactive we are not only struggling to keep up with the obesity levels, but both the physical and mental stress is killing us slowly. We have cut around 300 calories out of our working day according to Dr John Buckley, programme leader in cardiovascular rehabilitation at the University of Chester. Over a year that equates to around 26 lbs of fat, but some pudge around the middle is the least of your worries.</p>
<h2><strong>It’s Killing You</strong></h2>
<p>Slowly but surely things for your body start to look worse. A study from the journal Circulation: Heart Failure has revealed that those who sit for more than five hours a day have an <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/271518.php">increased risk of around 34% of heart failure</a>. This is despite how much exercise they might do outside of those hours sitting. This doesn‘t even take into consideration the increased levels of depression and insomnia, along with higher risks of developing some pretty life limiting conditions including diabetes and cancer. Take stock of that if you are one of the average people that spend more than 9 hours seated. Even if you have an active job; sitting for long periods of time surfing the internet, watching TV, or even playing games is simply not good for your body.</p>
<h2><strong>Keep Google Fit</strong></h2>
<p>I could go into the details of how the sitting position is just not natural for your body, the anatomical reasons for the pressure on the spine and digestive system. But this is a technology editorial. So the facts are these: You’re sitting down too much! Too much of your beloved tech is focused on keeping you seated in front of a screen engaged with it.</p>
<p>What’s more is no amount of good feeling you get from pounding the treadmill after work, getting your Google Fit goals, or even doing your steps for the day is going to change that. You’re going to have to change yourself. Many don’t even realise they are seated so long. The solution is a simple one: Stand Up.<br />
Lets get this straight, I love technology. I’m what you could describe of an evangelist. I spend the majority of my day preaching to those less able about access to technology. Technology is so brilliant and so wondrous it deserves to be used. It’s simply a case of making your usage as active as possible.</p>
<h2><strong>Active Tech</strong></h2>
<p>Simple things can make a world of difference, you won’t even notice the difference if you try it. The future you might come back and thank me though so please do if we ever invent time travel. Most of us are not in a position to get everyone using stand up desks so the changes we make might have to be a lot smaller. Just walking around whilst reading some of the daily social media intake and standing at lunch are a few easy fixes. I’m pretty sure you can be creative about slotting those active hours back into your day.</p>
<p>One bit of feedback I have made to Google is to include alarms if you are sitting still for a preset period of time in order to encourage a little activity during the day. This functionality is already available in some other smart watches and fitness trackers. The Fitness goal of 10,000 steps should not be the end all, and these steps should be evenly spread. It’s no good doing 8,000 in the morning and sitting for 6 hours.</p>

<p>Since the companies inception in 1976, Apple have been held in high regard for their hardware. Woz produced revolutionary designs for motherboards and circuitry, and <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-obsession-with-the-quality-of-the-things-unseen/">Steve was so obsessed with even the design of internal components</a> that nothing left the company without achieving a certain level of design and engineering beauty.</p>
<p>The brand Apple sums up visions of iPods, Macintosh computers and more importantly iPhones. Although as the enormous growth of the iPhone slows, the revenue Apple gains from its services is going from strength to strength. Sure this is not new news, but in the week that has followed since the second quarter earnings call the real stories have been shadowed by a slight drop off in iPhone sales.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate,” admitted Apple CEO Tim Cook</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple now in fact makes more in its ‘Services’ column than it does from Mac sales. This includes iTunes, the apps stores and also things like Apple pay, iCloud and licensing. Increasing to over 6billion this quarter and a 20% increased when compared to last year.</p>
<p>Splitting out individual components of Apples services – The App Store revenue increased again by 35% year-over-year. Even Apple pay no has over a million users per week, although the payment service alone does not make a “meaningful financial contribution at this point” says Apple CFO Luca Maestri.</p>
<p>As Services sits as Apples second biggest revenue provider behind the overshadowing iPhone it may show a glimpse into the future business model. Or it may simply be Apple makes meaningful updates to its Mac line up and it bounces back above services, but the thinking towards Apple surely has to shift.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Well they finally did it. Google finally listened to all us geeks and produced a premium phone for the 7th generation of its Nexus line. A show stopper, Google produced the pinnacle of what they believe an android phone should be, and how it should work. This is the Nexus 6p — and when p stands for premium all others should take note.</p>
<p>When something is made well, it has Apple build quality — it’s a phrase used over and over again. A few have successfully matched, and down right copied, but the name still sticks. There have been a few Android phones to push those ideas, but none of the Nexus line have ever got anywhere near the upper echelon of build quality.</p>
<h2>Build Quality</h2>
<p>You could argue that is not what Nexus is, they are there to show the best of Android and put it in an understated and affordable body so developers can tinker. It is the prevailing opinion that the claimed developer focus is just not the case anymore. When specs sheets are almost null and void because Android runs well on almost anything it’s the outside that will win over the user. With the 6p Google have shown that the Nexus line can, and hopefully will continue, to not just point the way but also keep up with the best of them.</p>
<p>It’s not a fair comparison to compare the 6p with its little brother the 5x, but they are both born of the same parents. Gone is the plastic found on the Nexus 5x, replaced by metal and glass. It is strong and weighty which is reassuring in the hand rather than frighteningly light and creaky. There is no risk of you bending the phone despite what you may see, the whole phone feels premium with nothing spared.<br />The manufacturing partner for this outing is Huawei — unfortunately little known to much of the general public. They have already produced some stellar hardware, that is often let down by the software. Thankfully you will find nothing but Googles Android here, notice that doesn’t say stock, because Nexus versions of Android are more Googley than ever.</p>
<p>Huawei have done a perfect job squeezing a 5.7 inch screen into a body that is infinitely easier to hold that the previous version (Nexus 6), with flat sides and slightly chamfered edges the phone is a little slippery to the touch but does its best to grip on where it can. The screen dominates the front, rocking an eye watering 1440 x 2560 pixels (518 ppi) that covers more than 70% of the front. Only flanked by stereo speakers at the top and bottom giving THE best audio experience on a smartphone I have experienced to date.</p>
<p>Around the back, in order to get the all metal design Huawei have placed all the radio equipment and camera lenses behind a strip of glass. This has caused contrasting opinions in the design world, due to being raised very slightly from the rest of the phone. In reality rather than taking anything away from the design, it makes it much easier to tell which way is up when pulling the phone from your pocket. Combine this with the ability to still lay flat on a table it is likely to become a non issue and one of the best features of the phone.</p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>Its also 100% worth the trade off for a bit of a hump, because Google made a big deal about these ‘Sony sensors’ they used in the new Nexus — and for once the results live up to the hype. As with the Nexus 5x, the camera is amongst the best Android snappers on the market. Images are crisp, and clear when there is plenty of light — with small amounts of noise creeping in when the light begins to fade.</p>
<p>Its unfortunate they didn’t include OIS even into this bigger phone, so images with small amounts of light survive by cracking the ISO up and image processing does the rest. You can mediate this by using HDR+, this reduces overly flattened areas of light and images are much more pleasing to the eye. See my periscope video above for some indicators of what you will be up against.</p>
<p>I have not struggled to get picture I want, although I have resorted to using the intelligent burst mode on more than one occasion and discarded the undesirable photos. This burst mode is only found on the Nexus 6p, and will not only take photos for as long as you keep your finger on the shutter, it will also make them into a moving GIF for you to share. Beware of all the images being backed up to Google photos though! You will find sample photos below from my Nexus 5x review — a cop out I know but its the same camera.</p>
<h2>Fingerprint Scanner</h2>
<p>The back of the phone does suffer the same fate is most previous Nexus phones, it doesn’t so much recieve a tramp stamp than a full back piece. With Nexus plastered all down the back of the phone just under the the mysterious small ring you will find on the back of both new Nexus phones. This of course outlines the fingerprint sensor, one which provides perhaps the best unlocking experience on the market.</p>
<p>After a few days of use you quickly become trained to the placement, a quick tap on the circle wakes and unlocks the phone with ease. In side by side tests the scanner was as accurate and for the majority quicker than the Touch ID sensor on the new iPhone 6s. Which just as with Apple’s new handset almost renders the lock screen useless unless you unlock the old fashioned way by using the power button.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>It is unfortunate to miss out on Android’s lock screen because it still does everything right, but the added security and ease of unlocking using just a tap is something no phone should be without. Once you are using the phone, it’s clear to see Google’s work hard to implement material design, the system animations and design elements flow easily into each other.</p>
<p>This still falls down in some apps, as with my Nexus 5x review it is the app ecosystem that falls short. It was months since I had used Android fully before popping my sim into the 5x, and although most things are obvious Android is still inconsistent in interface and also quality of apps. There is a tendency to be overly critical because of this, but with a bit of time getting used to and trying out new apps it’s not impossible to find everything you should need.</p>
<p>With that said, Google is trying to implement some kind of Android interface guidelines, but you don’t get enforcement when the platform is at least reasonably open. However if Android is ever to attempt to win over users from iOS the vast inconsistency between even app developers by the same companies needs to be addressed — but that is just not what Google is interested in.</p>
<h2>Battery Life</h2>
<p>Battery life has been somewhat of a small disappointment for me, packing in a 3450 mAh battery gave me hope of all day usage. While that is true for moderate usage, and it is light years better than the 5x, do not expect much more than 4.5 hours of screen on time. Although that is not everything in battery life, standby time is dramatically increased by Android doze mode, this is only useful for light users and if you place your phone on a surface for large parts of the day</p>
<h2>Buy it?</h2>
<p>The belief was that users bought an Android phone because they couldn’t afford an iPhone. It was what parents bought their kids, it then began a succession of Android handset until eventually they just bought an iPhone. If you owned the last Galaxy plastic phone, when you upgraded you went Apple and almost never went back — at least according to Apple.</p>
<p>That’s just not the case anymore. With phones like the 6p Google has a top tier that users graduate to and stay with Android. There is just no reason to switch, no longer is the iphone the only phone to get great pictures. The results and experience is the same and Android is familiar. The 6p is never going to win over iPhone users, because that’s just not what it is for, it’s for current users to buy — the best Android has to offer.</p>
<p>If you are in the market for an Android phone just stop, click that big button next to the 6p and buy it. It’s the best Android has to offer — and it shows.</p>

<p>It’s a weird thing the S upgrade of the iPhone, it is often overlooked — but always brings in features that become staples of the hardware line. The touch ID sensor with the 5s and Siri with the 4s, these models are not just the ‘tock’ to the redesigned models ‘tick’. However as every Cosplayer finds out, putting and S on something doesn’t make it super, after a stellar year can Apple give enough reason to upgrade?</p>
<h2>Size Matters</h2>
<p>Growth for Apple came from all directions when the 6 hit stores, most notably in China but also spurring a migration from Android users all over the globe — at a pretty high rate. No doubt turbo charged by Apple finally increasing the screen size to start at 4.7inches, something which is now considered pretty normal (or even still on the small side) for the rest of the smartphone market.</p>
<p>This new model from Apple has also been hitting the gym as it has changed quite a bit in shape, well for an S model anyway. It gains 0.2mm in height, 0.1mm in width, 0.2mm in thickness and a whopping 14g (6s) or 20g(6s+) in weight. Those few grams don’t seem like much but you really can feel it when you take it out the box, and all those little bits of millimeters mean an upgrade in dress size as some cases for the iPhone 6 won’t fit.</p>
<p>You really are going to notice the heft if upgrading on a two yearly contract cycle and coming from the 5s. With personal preferences aside, the extra weight isn’t a deal breaker but to say it’s unoticable is simply not correct. It does add a certain reassurance when handling the phone sans case, somewhat offsetting the retention of the slippy round corners — but as with the previous model these iPhone’s really look better in a case than out.</p>
<h2>Touch It</h2>
<p>The increases in size and weight are to account for something that Apple believes is the next level of multi touch. Including technology first introduced in the Apple watch and Macbook, but this is no longer force touch — its 3d touch. Expanding multi touch into the third dimension and allowing for multiple (read 3) levels of touch (read force) you can apply to the screen.</p>
<p>Adoption of the ‘next generation of multi touch’ is at the moment hit and miss, but almost all Apple apps have short cuts reminiscent of Jailbreak tweaks and in app peaking and popping. The almost kindergarten names for a quick preview window with a slightly hard press to the screen, but still doesn’t give me the option to slam the phone down with a really hard jab of the finger.</p>
<p>If Samsung et al were the creators of such technology it would be universally dismissed as a gimmick. Destined to spend it’s life alongside other software almost has beens like eye scrolling and hand waving, but Apple has the software and hardware clout to just maybe make this work. After the initial check to see which apps support shortcuts (if they don’t you just received a double vibrate in a virtual head shake) it easy to forget due to the lack of visual clues — but as more and more apps adopt it you may be 3d touching for a long time to come.</p>
<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<p>Touch improvements also expands to the Touch ID sensor, with the home buttons sporting Apple’s second generation hardware. Tim Cook claimed that the home button is now not only more accurate but halves the response time — and this certainly shows in real word usage. In many ways the speed and accuracy now negate the need for a lock screen at all, reduced to just a fleeting glance as the home screen appears should you unlock with the home button.</p>
<p>It still falls occasionally to finger tips that are slightly damp but much less than with the first generation, but continued home button to wake the phone means notifications are often missed due to the speed of the sensor. That is unless you resort to using the notification shade — which although it finally shows notifications in chronological order, still is next to useless. You can couple this with forgetting about the camera lockscreen shortcut, as it’s gone before you get chance to open it — however 3d touch gives you a quick way of getting you straight to those selfies.</p>
<h2>Not just flash, Retina flash.</h2>
<p>Once you do get the camera app open, the interface remains untouched, bar being coupled to Apple’s updated iSight sensor which bumps images up to 12mp from Apple usual 8. Although its is 50% larger, Apple have managed to maintain the speed and performance of its predecessor but don’t expect a revolution. This feels very much the bed for a much larger upgrade in future generations and a small hint that Apple is aware it is compared to much larger sensors supported by its Android rivals.</p>
<p>It is a very good camera, the best iPhone camera yet. The larger sensor allows for a larger image captured, meaning cropping and zooming is much easier and detailed. However in a stark change from many preceding years I am not sure the camera is the best smartphone camera any longer. Many Android alternatives produce much crisper and detailed snapps particularly when the light is fading — but the iPhone is consistent in capturing images with ease and simplicity we have always known.</p>
<p>There is one small difference to the interface that users might not even notice, three small concentric circles at the top allow activation of what Apple calls live photos. Reminiscence of HTC’s Zoe the camera app catches the few seconds preceding and immediately after taking a picture. Allowing for no doubt some great small clips to be captured.</p>
<p>In reality all I have managed to catch is video of me taking my phone out of my pocket or a few seconds of posing before the picture is taken. Unless you make a conscious effort to think this might be a good time to capture a live image it’s likely to spend much of its life turned off. That is without taking into account that live photos take up twice the space as a normal picture, a few seconds of low frame rate video and audio doesn’t seem worth the trade off.</p>
<p>The revolution this time around is around the front, now Apple have finally updated its age old 1.2mp camera to a more modern 5mp one. In order to make sure you always get a great selfie Apple have also included a hardware chip allowing the screen to act as a flash by increasing brightness above its maximum level. Selfies are well and truly here to stay, but even if that isn’t your thing camera quality across facetime is now much clearer and brighter.</p>
<h2>￼Bigger, Faster, Stronger</h2>
<p>Battery life also joins the many specs that leave you with the same feeling as last time.The size of the battery has actually diminished but with improvements in iOS9 real world battery life remains unchanged. The regular model will see you through a day unless you are a heavy user and the bigger plus model is nearly impossible to kill.</p>
<p>So there you have it, a few changes amongst a phone that Apple claims ‘everything has changed’. There are countless things that haven’t changed amongst a few that have, slightly. Most review focus on the improved internals, the new A9 gives console level gaming on a handheld device.That may be the case — and real world usage indeed shows how quick the phone is in a few short minutes.</p>
<p>However most of (at least my phones) its life will be spent texting, tweeting and the odd game of dots. The upgrade is made ever the more difficult by the fact last years model is no slouch either — so if you already have the 6 it will be a tough call to upgrade or not. If there isn’t a feature above that stands out, and you don’t like the look of Rose Gold (pink), there really is no reason to switch.</p>
<p>No matter what the adverts say there is no revolution here. The 6s is without doubt the best iPhone yet, but it’s not one that will change the industry — it’s just a tock.</p>

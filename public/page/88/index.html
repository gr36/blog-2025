<p>This is the first time in a long time I have had something effortless to talk about. Two things that have been large in my life and felt like they matter to me again. Things are starting to come back, but I have a feeling they will never be back to normal. Unfortunately I spend no time traveling and no time in my office, so I am listening almost no podcasts.</p>
<p>I am not alone either, it’s great to not have to travel all the time and commute to meetings all the time, but I feel I am missing a certain amount of information by not listening to my beloved podcasts. The only time I can grab an episode or two is while running, and that doesn’t happen very often since becoming much more <a href="https://gr36.com/injured-best-thing-health/">inclined to take my bike out</a>.</p>
<p>Listening seems to have shifted to an <a href="https://medium.com/acast/how-covid-19-is-changing-the-podcast-landscape-now-and-what-the-data-tells-us-about-the-future-81210e504aff">at home experience for some</a>, but I just can’t make it stick. If I try to do things whilst listening then I don’t pay nearly as much attention and often missing large sections. Ultimately, I just don’t feel as engrossed as I am if I listen while driving. No great loss, but I do feel less informed than normal — perhaps that’s a good thing.</p>

<p>Now is not the time to start talking about features, there is enough coverage out there for you to find out all the details. What is relevant is the experience and the way in which Apple competed their keynote and it was interesting to say the least.</p>
<p>Thankfully for my inner nerd instead of cancelling the event, Apple took the whole event online. WWDC is usually packed full of developers and press, and tickets to be able to attend the headline keynote are well thought after. People packed into a theatre obviously isn’t possible at the moment, so attending as out, but the video portion took on a completely new feel.</p>
<p>The whole keynote was prerecorded, with special effects, cleaver editing and a really nice feel. It managed to keep Apples usual flair and in jokes but got straight to the point. I enjoyed it much more and it was easier for my wife to suffer through it due to not feeling pushed out. Ultimately the event felt more approachable for almost everyone, it was much easier to understand and didn’t get dragged off talking about retail or revue income.</p>
<p>If I could choose, id like Apple to keep the more streamlined appeal, but also with some in person feel. What that looks like I am not sure, but it helped not to have to pause after every announcement for whooping in the audience. Developers have also <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1275849771190759427">felt more able to code alongside</a> an event you can pause and rewind, so I think everyone will benefit from the lessons learnt this year.</p>
<p>This should be a lesson to all companies needing to switch their business model, it is Vitaly important you keep your business moving but maintain your personality. Moving things online doesn’t mean you need to miss out on the personal touch.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>What is there to say that already hasn’t been covered about the new email service from Basecamp. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now, having made sure I got hold of invites for me and <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/hey-feature-requests-and-improvements-id-love-to-see/">a couple of people</a> I wanted to take a look at it. After initially rejecting it, I have grown to like it and feel like it will make a difference to my email interactions. So if you want to reach out to me, you can always email me <a>greg.morris@hey.com</a>, especially if you’re using the service too, as I would love to know your thoughts.</p><p>This is without discussing the Apple App Store issue that are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch">combined with the launch story</a>, which I don’t really want to comment on because this has been said a hundred times and will continue to be head about every so often for ever more. Some fo this is a valid concern, some of this is marketing and it’s nearly impossible to find the divide, but there has been a resolution for the time being, so we will wait to see what happens.</p><p>There are two things that have really changed the way I use my email and made finding thins so much easier. Hey allows you to rename the subject of emails, not something you would think revolutionary but it makes a bit of difference. I get loads of emails with no subject to being able to rename them makes it look and feel much better — this is completely on your side and doesn’t mess up anything for the other person that emailed you.</p><p>The second is being able to combine threads. I have never found an email client that gets this right and often end up with disjointed emails on the same subject. Or just followups that the other person didn’t reply to and instead sent a new email. In Hey, you can select any emails chains you wish and combine them all together. Agin this is completely on your side, so you can combine those from different people but about the same thing and nothing messes up the other end.</p><p>This is without considering all the features like reply later, tracking blocks and notification customisations. For a great overview check out Matt Birchler’s video below.</p><p>There is so much wrong with email, but there is nothing better. Every time someone tries to come up with something better it become tied down to payments, or locked to services. Hey is both of those things, but still open for people to contact you the same as normal. To me, this service is not perfect, but shows all the signs of making email better. It might not be forever, but at the minute, it’s great.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I have made it my mission to not talk about all the App Store issues surrounding the launch of this app. I might mention it, but it’s a conversation for those that are more educated than I. I have been using the service, however, and after two weeks of use I have some features that I want to share with you that might just make your life easier.</p>
<h2>Imbox</h2>
<p>This is the most obvious feature that is talked about. This is an inbox for you most important things — hence Imbox. Horrible name, great idea. When you get an email from someone for the first time, this is flagged for you to approve, or deny the request to get through.</p>
<p>So only the most important things alert you to their presence. If this is a receipt you can select to deliver this straight to Paper Trail, which stores them all silently, or if this is a marketing email or newsletter this can go to The Feed.</p>
<p>Watch an overview of this <a href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI?t=22">here</a></p>
<h2>Renaming Subjects</h2>
<p>You know those emails you get with no subject, or the email body is in the subject. Well, turns out they annoy all of us, so Hey made is possible to rename the subject of an email, without any input from the persona emailing you.</p>
<p>With a couple of taps you can rename the email, making it easier to find it later, and it doesn’t affect the other side of the conversation.</p>
<p>Watch an overview of this <a href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI?t=1090">here</a></p>
<h2>Merge Threads</h2>
<p>It drives me insane when you get an email about the same thing, but it’s not a reply, or your email app decides it needs its thread (looking at you Apple mail). Will this is fixed too. You can merge threads back together, and even emails chains form different people about the same thing. Again without affecting the other side of the chain.</p>
<p>Watch an overview of this <a href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI?t=1180">here</a></p>
<h2>Clips</h2>
<p>Ever want to remember something like an account number of insertion but don’t want to go searching through all your emails to find it. You can clip text from an email and make it easier to find when you need it.</p>
<p>Watch and overview of this <a href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI?t=1600">here</a></p>
<h2>Notes To Self</h2>
<p>Ever wanted to keep all your information in one place about a subject, but didn’t know how to do it. In Hey, you can make notes in an email chain that only appear to you. So for example you can make notes of telephone conversations with the person or simply notes to cover when replying later.</p>
<p>Watch an overview of this <a href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI?t=2030">here</a></p>
<p>There are loads more features than these but I wanted to give an overview to show this is not just another email service. Many things you can do with Gmail filters, but these above have already come in really useful for me — I even signed up and paid the yearly fee yesterday!</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>
<p>Much like the COVID-19 outbreak, all things seem unimportant any longer. Over the past fortnight since the last edition, at some points it felt like the whole fabric of the world was going to fall apart, but we are getting through things and trying to return to some normal. Of course some things need changing for the world to continue, and although some of us don’t speak up and walk with you, we are behind you every step of the way.</p>
<p>With that said, it doesn’t change the fact that things do continue, and can continue alongside more important issues. It may mean that things become less important but struggles like this should allow us to reframe our existence and find out what really matters to us.</p>
<p>What we once considered smaller things in life have suddenly become critical to people. Walking with my family has become significant to me, as has exercise and cycling specifically that I have spoken about before.</p>
<p>The real dichotomy of the situation is that cycling really shouldn’t matter to me, as with all sport in the current climate, it appears on the surface a pointless endeavour. Nothing is achieved by it, I am not serving a purpose and you could argue it is not essential. But the real beauty of sport and exercise is that taking part is so important to us.</p>
<p>I have seen some usually upbeat and active people going through a painful process of looking at their activities with critical eyes. Whatever your interest they have taken on some weird oxymoronic place in many peoples lives that it is both essential and non-essential simultaneously. Whatever it is that you take part in shouldn’t make you feel bad for carrying on.</p>
<p>This may be the place technology takes for you. You understand that having the latest phone or computer doesn’t matter in the slightest, but also matters a great deal to you.</p>

      <p>When first starting out publishing to the internet I had no idea what I wanted it to be. I had no idea how WordPress, or much of the web, worked and would update my HTML site by building a new page and linking to it from an index.</p><p>It seems strange now looking back at the few months I spent doing that before getting to grips with a CMS. But all I was worried about was writing a post and getting it online. That fact I didn’t even know how to publish to the internet properly but spent so much time making sure I did leave me with nostalgia for simpler times. Times when I thought of myself as a writer, so I did what I though writer did and that was publishing often.</p><p>I wasn’t worried about stats, or SEO, or optimisation of any kind — I just wanted my word on the internet. I wanted for a very long time to join the ranks of a large publication and write away all day until I ran out of ideas — but now I couldn’t think of anything worse.</p><p>Compared that to todays world and you would think things would have improved. Yet whenever I think about writing anything now I am filled with dread unless it heads to my blog. I don’t have to worry about anything that content writers need to worry about, I can write exactly what I want and hit publish.</p><p>As <a href="https://pjrvs.com/about">Paul Jarvis</a> wrote about in his excellent <a href="https://pjrvs.com/blogger">I’d rather be a blogger</a> post, the hassles and strains of content producers should not be any of our concern. I used to want to be a writer, but now I love being a blogger.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>At some point each year I fall out of love with my Apple Watch and leave it on its charger. This isn’t a new thing, but I always return after <a href="https://gr36.com/hey-apple-we-need-a-rest/">a week or so rest</a> and kick myself for not keeping up with my activity rings. This time feels different though, and I am starting to wonder if I am about to follow <a href="https://gr36.com/ive-taken-my-watch-off-chis-hannah/">fellow enthusiasts</a> down the route of removing it for good?</p>
<p>The weird thing is, the Apple Watch has been my favourite device for the <a href="https://gr36.com/i-like-this-apple-watch-more-than-i-thought/">past five years</a>. I have written <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/apple-watch/">so many posts about it</a>, and my love of wearing it, above and beyond anything else. Despite a few <a href="https://gr36.com/i-cant-settle-on-an-apple-watch-face/">recent grumbles</a>, I have owned all five iterations of it and gone out of my way to keep one on my wrist at all times. So, it seems even more strange that my love has faded quite dramatically.</p>
<p>I am not sure if it is because of the warmer weather or worrying about tan marks. Working from home could be removing some fo the need for it. To be honest it could be a range of things, but for some reason this keeps happening and this year it has been a few weeks since i continuously put it on each morning. I have been sometimes intentionally putting it on if I want to be contactable but with out my phone, but more often than not it has been left on my bedside table.</p>
<p>The health benefits that filling my rings have been huge. When <a href="https://gr36.com/my-life-beholden-to-three-coloured-circles/">first realising</a> this would make a difference, too now, the three rings have pushed me that bit further to improve my health. Yet I don’t feel the need fill these <a href="https://gr36.com/filling-all-those-rings/">tricolour pests</a> any longer and just cycle when I want (all the time). I am not at the stage where I would get rid of my watch, it gives me the opportunity to not take my phone out and the £5pm is negligible for this convenience.</p>
<p>Currently, it makes an expensive bedside clock and that’s about it.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about this since <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/my-place-in-tech/">Matt Birchler wrote about it</a> a few days ago. Matt has managed to carve out a huge market for what he has to say and often attracts a large audience and invitations to many podcasts. In many ways he does what we lowly blogger dream of, and all whilst not really trying — and being amazingly talented.</p>
<blockquote><p>I hope that I am a sobering voice in the world of tech bloggers. I don’t try to write things that are scandalous or are just written to stir the pot of controversy, and I am not on any company’s list for getting pre-release hardware for reviews, so I don’t tend to go viral.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is it right to think, or worry, about such things instead of just writing? I think it is nice to know where your angle is and stick to your guiding motivation. Otherwise, you can end up being one of those people that moves themselves into camps easily and publish content just to point towards one of them. Things that get picked up and get you loads of views are great, but often only fall into the extremes of arguments. No one is paying attention to the write-ups of their Magic Keyboard in which they are measured, objective and make sound judgements — which is where the issues can start to arise if you’re not careful.</p>
<p>Everyone wants views, clicks, watches, whatever the metric is that defines you, but we must stick to our principles and make sure we find our place in the market whatever we are doing. It’s easy to present them as facts, but presenting our ideas and making them rational and easy to understand is key to staying true to yourself and others. I hope I do a good enough job at this because it is one of my main focuses when hitting publish.</p>

<div>
<p>I am at the stage of my life when I really don’t care who did what, and why things happen. I am perfectly ok with companies copying features that make life easier, but are we all ok with blatant design rips offs now?</p>
<p>Admittedly <a href="https://gr36.com/copying-the-notch-is-only-part-of-the-problem/">this</a> isn’t a new thing, and not exclusive to technology products either but such blatantly rip-offs have become so common it is hard to tell the difference. Walking around the streets I see imitation AirPods (the stems are usually longer and thicker) which is part and parcel of the status symbol they have been come attached with. They are sold in shops of a dubious nature for a fraction of the price and of course much of their features missing.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>However, that is nothing when comparing big brands like Oppo and Xiaomi ripping off designs and selling them like everything is ok. Imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery, but copying such horrible designs as the notch in the iPhone X(S) is downright stupid. Yet here we are, with the tech press perfectly ok with it, and nothing done by regulators.</p>
<p>Above is the new Oppo Watch, a product that is undeniably a rip off of the Apple Watch. This in itself doesn’t really matter, after all there isn’t match you can do with a smartwatch, but the watch faces and overall software design is so blatantly copied that it can’t be taken seriously. This should be sold on markets stalls and corner stores, not taken seriously. Yet all the big outlets are reviewing it so this must be an acceptable practice now.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Since sharing my <a href="https://gr36.com/todoist-organise-my-life/">Todoist set up</a> and how I get things done loads of people have given me some ideas and shared their experience. <a href="https://twitter.com/MrChrisJWilson/status/1262601218674786304?s=20">One of which</a> I wanted to try to help out with, and that is the natural language input. This feels amazingly natural to me, but for some feels like a bit of a code — so let’s crack it together.</p>
<p>On Mac, you can use <a href="https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/115001745265-Task-Quick-Add">Control+Command+A</a> to open quick add. Or to start your entry, regardless of platform, just tap or click on the Plus icon. Quick Add is the fastest way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a new task</li>
<li>Set a due date and time for a task</li>
<li>Attach a label to a task</li>
<li>Set the priority level for a task</li>
<li>Add a task to a project</li>
<li>Assign a task to a collaborator</li>
</ul>
<h2>Date And Time</h2>
<p>If you can’t crack this bit then there might not be much help for you, as it’s that easy. Simply write out when you want to complete the task exactly how you would say it. For example, “tomorrow at 4pm” or “every other Tuesday starting March 3rd”.</p>
<p><code>Call mum next wednesday at 2pm</code></p>
<p>This can be as simple or as powerful as you need it to be. Most tasks you add will have a context date e.g. next Friday, or an actual date 2nd March, but some don’t fit into this pattern. Luckily, Todoist understands even complicated expressions and will interrupt what you need pretty much all the time.</p>
<h2>Repeating Tasks</h2>
<p>For things that crop up regularly, or just every so often, you will soon get to grips with typing ‘every’ to get these set up. Every is the start of all things repeating and is really helpful for even the most complex things.</p>
<p><code>Call mum every wednesday</code></p>
<p>But it doesn’t have to stop there, you can arrange tasks for whenever suits you.</p>
<p><code>Call mum every other week day</code></p>
<p><code>Call mum every wedneday june 2nd to july 1st</code></p>
<p>For those tasks that you want to happen a specific period after you complete it put in an !.</p>
<p><code>Call mum every! week</code></p>
<p>This will set up a task to call mum exactly a week after you complete the last item. You can of course use every! Day, month, year — depends on how often you want to do it.</p>
<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>
<h2>Labels</h2>
<p>Labels help me highlight something that I want to know at specific times. For example, I have a morning tag, and a someday tag, so I don’t need to give these due dates or times, but I can find these tasks easily when required.</p>
<p>To add a tag just put a @ before the name.</p>
<p><code>Call mum next wednesday @morning</code></p>
<p>You can make these as complex or as easy as you like. Some people like to have tags for tasks they need to do while driving, or when they have a spare 5 minutes.</p>
<p><code>Call mum next wednesday @driving</code></p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-05-20-at-14.12.45-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9f38a405b9.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 05 20 at 14 12 45 1" width="595" height="91" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Priority</h2>
<p>I have never adopted priorities in either email flags or my tasks, but it helps hugely if you want to sift through all your tasks and really get down to how important things are. To assign a priority (flag) just type p1, p2 or p3.</p>
<p><code>Call mum next wednesday p1</code></p>
<p>So, when your tasks are listed in Today view or Upcoming view they will be sorted by priority so you can get the most important things done first.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>Projects are the main sorting point for most users set up in Todoist. They can be used in a variety of ways to highlight long-term project or simply having an area to assign task to — such as home and work.</p>
<p>To move a task to a project you simply put a # before it. You can type all of it out or just the first few letters and then tap on the suggestion.</p>
<p><code>Call Mum next wednesday #home</code></p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Todoist-Quick-Add-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8313fcffd9.jpg" alt="Todoist Quick Add 1" width="2000" height="955" border="0" /></p>
<h2>Collaborator</h2>
<p>If you need some help, or just want to allocate your task to someone else that you work with, you can do this by typing a + and then their name. Again type it all out, or just the first few letters and then tap their name in the popup suggestion.</p>
<p><code>Call Mum next wednesday +Jon</code></p>
<p>This is only possible in shared projects so make sure you have assigned the correct project first. The above example would not work, but the following <em>will</em> if you share a home project with Jon.</p>
<p><code>Call mum next wednesday #home +Jon</code></p>
<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br /><ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8335452151565777" data-ad-slot="6575033860"></ins><br /><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>
<h2>Linking it all</h2>
<p>The real power of all these ‘codes’ is that you can link them all together and make powerful but quick entires into your task list. This rapidly becomes second nature and allows you to brain dump effortlessly with minimal sorting afterwards.</p>
<p>So setting a reminder to call mum at 7pm every 7 days for 8 weeks, adding it to your routines task and attaching a personal tag becomes</p>
<p><code>call mum every! week until 8th july #routines @personal</code></p>
<p>You’ll be using <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">Todoist</a> as power user in no time and setting it up to remind you of everything you need. Why not <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">sign up</a> and give it a shot as I’d love to see your setups or how you use Todoist to help you get things done.</p>

     <p>Since moving to a <a href="/2021/11/05/a-new-home.html">new domain</a> and trying to put all the things I create together online, I&rsquo;ve been feeling a bit of pressure. Granted, completely self-imposed, but a very real tinge of anxiety to be better at what I publish there. A noble pursuit but one that’s made me feel down.</p>
<p>Before I discuss these worries, let&rsquo;s take a step back a bit and be honest. I&rsquo;m playing pretend. In a world of writers, photographers and all around publishing masters — I&rsquo;m not even small fry and the framing of this is important when discussing these types of worries. Simply because I shouldn&rsquo;t have them at all.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a0cf84bb2c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Publishing my thoughts to the internet was easy when I didn&rsquo;t care. My domain wasn&rsquo;t my name, and I wasn&rsquo;t even pretending to build some kind of online presence. I’ve been putting things online for a little short of a decade and never worried once about what it looked like. Something worth remembering because my blog in no small part is one of the reasons I have my day job. Yet now, I have some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yips">blogging yips</a> because nothing is good enough to be published.</p>
<p>There are no shortage of ideas on what to write about, but they rarely make it past a draft. To cure it, I’ve had to <a href="/2022/09/16/why-gr-has.html">strip everything back</a> and make my writing more personal. Go back to my blogging roots and make my website about me again. I may be boring, I may make ridiculous typos, but it’s the only way for me to seemingly publish more often.</p>
<p>I am positive others feel this way because they compare themselves to others. It’s the way of the modern world online, comparing <a href="/2021/05/31/insides-vs-outsides.html">your insides to everyone else’s outsides</a> and we all know it. Sometimes you have to get out your own way and just do it.</p>

     <p>There is no getting away from my love of photography and cameras. My favourite thing in the world is going somewhere, anywhere, and just wondering around pointing my lens at things. The simple act of doing so is like mediation to me, and nothing thing else comes close.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I shoot loads, sometimes I don&rsquo;t. Occasionally, I get things I am happy with, more often they <a href="/2021/08/04/other-peoples-trash.html">all go in the bin</a>. I love having my camera in my hand, and each year when new iPhone day comes around, I seemingly forget no phone can replace it.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/58a79e02e9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The process of taking photos has nothing to do with the camera I have. The iPhone camera that’s in my pocket is more than capable of capturing most of the street photography I do. The reason a camera matters so much to me is that it is <em>just</em> a camera. Nothing more, no internet, no restrictions. I am alone with the world.</p>
<p>I do take loads of photos with my phone too. No doubt once I <a href="/2022/09/18/schrdingers-iphone.html">get over myself,</a> I will enjoy using the iPhone 14 Pro huge new sensor. In fact, it’s the only reason I bought it. I couldn’t care less about dynamic islands and always on displays. As soon as Apple began talking about the new 48mp sensor, my brain was already thinking about what I could do with it. It’s just not a camera.</p>
<p>Let’s take nothing away from mobile photography. In no way do you <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2018/10/14/224500.html">need a camera</a> to be a photographer, people get spectacular shots using smartphones. That is simply not me. As strange as this sounds, <a href="/2021/07/29/having-a-camera.html">having and using a camera</a> has become part of my identity as an individual. I carry my x100v with me anywhere, and <a href="https://social.lol/@gr36/108966608695072912">despite my initial thoughts,</a> I don&rsquo;t think that will stop. I’ve never really enjoyed using a phone to take anything more than snapshots but I think now might be the time to at least try.</p>

     <p>Damon Beres writing for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/iphone-14-apple-annual-upgrade-improvements/671380/">The Atlantic</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a market generally defined by boring hunks of plastic, Apple gained an edge through impeccable design that was actually less functional than most of the competition.</p></blockquote>
<p>The iPhone got its foot hood in the market because it <em>was</em> Apple. They designed and presented it in a way that was theirs, and no one else could come close to the pull they had. It wasn’t the best, didn’t have all the features that everyone else did, but it was exciting and new.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The iPhone 14, meanwhile, with a suite of incremental and frankly boring improvements, is the iPhone that will change nothing.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a bit steep to say nothing, but it doesn’t change much. The rate of change is so small now that new releases are boiled down to a few words. Even the marketing is clutching at straws and the presentations are filled with things that the old model could do, or can now do with the software update launched with the new phone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where the iPhone once symbolised verve, it now evokes crushing inevitability. The company will produce, the people will consume, and the waste will pile up (and up and up).</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple doesn&rsquo;t even need to try to sell phones. Users buy the version newer than the one they have and continue to do so. Complacency is nothing to fear when your market is this dominant and if you sell a few less, you spent less in developing it, so what does it matter.</p>

     <p>Each year, when the new iPhone is released, I feel the same emotions that I experienced the year before. The iPhone takes up a weird position in my life where I both want it and don&rsquo;t want it at the same time. Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t open a box and remove the device from its unknown position.</p>
<p>I first observed this <a href="/2020/11/21/the-iphone-line.html">with the iPhone 12</a>, but the new iPhone 14 pro has taken this to a whole new level. The shiny new device that landed at my house on Friday is beautiful and really nice to use, but also ultimately pointless and offers me very little exchange for the outlay. This is the problem, it’s so impressive and shiny and new that I want to pick it up and use it, but also don’t want to use my phone all the time. I don’t have anything <a href="/2022/09/06/the-internet-is.html"> to do on it anyway</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/800a58b184.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I am not motivated nor excited by gadgets any more. Perhaps because I am getting old, or perhaps <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/iphone-14-apple-annual-upgrade-improvements/671380/">iPhones are getting boring now</a>. My phone is a tool, a tool I try to use as little as possible, but have accepted that it must exist in my life. The iPhone 14 pro is so good at its job that I can rely on it to do more things than ever before. I can read, and write, and take outstanding photos. I can also doom scroll social media and miss the world around me.</p>
<p>I realise all of this is no fault of Apple or the iPhone, <a href="/2020/09/09/itxs-not-the.html">it’s me</a>. I want to put these barriers in place so that I enjoy my life more, yet I miss the times that iPhone delivery day was one of the best times of the year. The new iPhone didn’t cost me much due to selling my old one, and there was only one version to choose from. Now my comparison is against the £1200 I spent buying my shiny new toy and the value it gives me back.</p>
<p>As for right now, I’m typing this out on my iPhone 13 mini. Trying to express my feelings as if writing in a journal to myself. Can I afford the new iPhone, sure. Do I really want to spend this money, not really. This one does just fine, and probably will for a while. It’s just the desire for the shiny new things I can’t switch off. That&rsquo;s what marketing does to you, I guess.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>My life online is often complex and filled with preaching advice that I don’t take. More often than not, that involves my use of an app or blogging platform. If you’re new around here I go backwards and forwards in just about everything and most the of words coming further down the page I have said before but still don’t really believe. My blogging habits suck.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, I have wanted to be a writer. About technology mainly. There are two pretty big reasons standing in the way of though. One is that I’m not any good at it. Two, I can’t be bothered to put in the effort to become good at it, despite the number of blog posts I have written telling myself I am going to.</p>
<p>At various points in my life, I convince myself that I am going to knuckle down and get on with it. Or build a more professional blog, or just burn it all down and publish what I like. Of course, I believe all of these things, at the time. I’m well aware of what I should be doing, and messing around like I do is not that.</p>
<p>Anyway, those more observant of you might have noticed that I am publishing on my ‘old’ domain again. The reasons for this are related to a lack of motivation rather than a brilliant idea. Publishing more personal posts and returning to more of a microblog intention is where my current motivation is, and I really couldn’t be bothered to move things properly. The friction is <a href="/2022/08/26/the-quiet-and.html">deciding where the different types of posts</a> I was writing began to get too much.</p>
<p>All of my old blog posts can still be found on gregmorris.co.uk, but I won’t be publishing anything new there going forward. Not because I’ve given up, I just couldn’t find an easy way to do what I wanted with the permalinks and RSS feed. To be frank, I could have sorted it out, but the work I would have put in vs the return from actually blogging just didn’t make sense.</p>
<p>So, everything is here, and also there. Get it. Good. Carry on.</p>

     <p>Over the last few weeks, I have come to realise how much time that I spend waiting for people. Islam sat in my car, just chilling and waiting for something to finish.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8b14a0a391.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is usually my view. Waiting for my son to finish school and walk to meet me. I’m not cool enough to be able to actually go to his school any more, so I have to sit in the car and wait. Which I guess could be viewed as wasted time.</p>
<p>Thankfully it gives me time to catch up on my reading queue, or listen to a podcast or write a quick post (like this one). I used to spend much longer time on my own, but driving all over the country, so I guess in the grand scheme of things it’s a net win.</p>
<p>I love to people watch too. Just take in what else is going on in the world. I just wish my waiting places were a bit more interesting. Does anyone else live there life like this? I don’t mind it, really.</p>

     <p>Day two of <a href="/2022/09/09/caught-again.html">being positive</a>, and it has been a lonely one. In other circumstances my day might have been considered perfect, filled with crap TV, books and chilling out. I don’t feel ill per se (bar a headache and a bit of a cough) but I am completely drained of energy.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/15ded37443.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Despite my family checking on me and making sure I am OK, it’s not the same as hanging out together. This is what I miss the most. Keeping myself away from the others is the right thing to do, but it feels really isolating and not what I am used to. I look forward to our weekends together and even if we don’t do much, enjoy time just hanging out.</p>
<p>I am having to do things in burst due to feeling worn out, just sitting up and typing this out is bound to leave me feeling tired again. However, there isn’t much sleeping going on due to my dreams being disturbed and a bit hallucinogenic. When I wake up, I feel as if I have been out running, not laying in my bed.</p>
<p>COVID is such fun. It isn’t like any other illness I have had before and despite having three vaccinations, and catching it symptom free last year I can still feel this ill is weird.</p>

     <p>On Wednesday afternoon, I started to feel a bit under the weather. Nothing major, just a bit of a sore throat and lacking energy, but I’d already been for a run that morning, followed by loads of meetings, so I figured I just needed some rest. After taking some tablets, I headed to bed for one of the worst night of sleep I have ever had, and that’s where the fun began.</p>
<p>Tossing and turning, periods of hot sweats and feeling unbelievably cold gave way to a massive headache and no energy. I knew this feeling from earlier in the year though, so I did the sensible thing and did a COVID test, which came back negative. The giant headache I had was like nothing I had experienced before, making me feel sick and unable to do anything.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/97f7965ea6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Thankfully, this morning I felt a bit better and managed to shake off the bad head thanks to loads of painkillers. I thought it was all behind me until the cough caught up with me, and at that point I decided to test again and the dreaded red line appeared!</p>
<p>Could be placebo, or could be that I am heading down hill, but the cough is worse, and my energy levels have dropped to zero. However, I am feeling OK in myself. The worst part by far is having to stay away from my family. I’m semi distanced upstairs, and I miss them tremendously. Lucie didn’t understand why she couldn’t have a cuddle after school, but I couldn’t bare her getting poorly.</p>
<p>Could be much worse, I suppose.</p>

     <p>For what seems like forever, I have been trying to cut down my usage of Twitter. Going around and around in circles with tactics to reduce the time <a href="/2022/08/02/writing-instead-of.html">spent scrolling</a> and place it somewhere else. I know the service is bad for me, for issues that are <a href="/2020/09/09/itxs-not-the.html">my own, not the services</a>, but after years of usage I just can’t stay away.</p>
<p>It drags me down rabbit holes that I use to avoid doing other things, and ultimately make myself feel worse about the world and affecting my mental health. I know this, yet still do it, so I’ve taken some drastic action to avoid even logging in. On Sunday, I changed my password to one that I do not know, and then <a href="/2022/09/03/ive-had-to.html">deactivated my account</a>. I now have no choice but to have a little break away from using Twitter, with the surprising realisation that the internet is actually pretty boring!</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/851409a86b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Granted, I don’t stray into much of the web, but it no longer provides the entertainment relief it used to, and I’m fine with that. The itch to reach for my phone is slowly going due to the fact I open up a couple of other apps, realise nothing is happening and then close them again.</p>
<p>I guess I’ll carry on reading or writing instead of scrolling, as well as lifting my outlook on the world. I’d like some more group chats in my life though to fill my <a href="/2022/08/30/social-media-interaction.html">slightly isolated feeling</a>.</p>

     <p>Today is one of the scary times as a parent, the first day at big school for my son. He’s 11, so he’s off to secondary school, and at this point in life it’s a hug shift to go through. Thankfully he’s coping with it really well, and despite some nerves he’s really looking forward to new experiences.</p>
<p>On our way to school, he was asking me about my first day at school, and to be honest, I don’t even remember it. Not because it was more than 25 years ago (yes I am that old) but because not much of my school life seems to have stuck in my head. I guess that’s the thing with the events, they seem huge at the time, but depending <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/01/06/it-depends-on.html">on when you write the novel that is your life</a>, depends on how much space it takes up.</p>
<p>All I remember are fleeting little memories that really stuck out, but the nerves and terrible feeling that no doubt happened on my first day are lost to time. We spent a few minutes talking about that, and he realised he couldn’t even remember his first day back last year, so that gave him confidence.</p>
<p>I am so proud of him. Not because of what he achieves or the things he does, but because of the person he has become. <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/james-morris/">James</a> is such a nice person to be around and that gives me confidence with the way we have worked as a family. We will only get this experience once, as Lucie stays at the same school until she is 19, so we might as well try to enjoy it today.</p>

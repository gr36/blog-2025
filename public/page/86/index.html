      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Vishal Kataria <a href="https://aryatra.com/anteambulo/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every artist whose work made an impact did more than just his work. He appreciated the opportunities he got to clear the path for patrons which in turn, helped him see how things worked on the inside and opened new doors for him. Rather than getting angry about having to “serve others,” artists saw this as ways to add value to their patrons. In the process, they added value to their own work and lives.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Being an <em><em>anteambulo</em></em> is not about making others <em><em>look good</em></em>. It’s about providing others with support so that they can be better. It’s about associating with people <a href="http://aryatra.com/secrets-successful-people/" rel="noopener">more successful than yourself</a> and clearing the path for them. It’s about helping declutter their lives so that they can focus on their strengths.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Being an <em><em>anteambulo</em></em> is not being a sycophant. It’s not trying to make things <em><em>look better</em></em>. It’s not about sucking up to your boss so that you get a promotion or a better salary hike.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like Vishal I came across this concept reading <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ego-Enemy-Master-Greatest-Opponent-ebook/dp/B01AWUTMB0/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_">Ego is the enemy</a> and found it really interesting. Making life easier for successful or people in a position of power seems counter intuitive, but has been the path to greatness for so many people. It is simply ego stopping everyone from doing similar things and exploring the opportunities that come your way.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Kim Lyons for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/15/21370020/mozilla-google-firefox-search-engine-browser">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Most of Mozilla’s revenue comes from search engine companies like Google— as well as Yandex in Russia and Baidu in China— that pay for their search engine to be the default option in Firefox.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I really like Mozilla, their approach to something has been a bit strange, and they have wasted loads of time messing around with an OS and VR, but at the end of it all they have the open web as a whole at their heart.</p>
<p>But with that said, I don’t agree these agreements that Google makes to be the default search engine. They don’t just do it with Mozilla, they also pay <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/24/why-google-is-willing-to-pay-apple-12-billion-per.aspx">Apple billions</a> to be default on iOS, and I am sure elsewhere that we don’t hear about. It’s not just google, I don’t agree that any company should be the default, I believe that customer should be given the choice with transparent information about the different approaches.</p>
<p>Thankfully, regulators are starting to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlypage/2020/07/02/uk-regulator-takes-aim-at-apple-and-googles-billion-pound-search-deal/">take aim at these deals</a>. After the EU ruling on <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/duckduckgo-is-now-a-default-search-engine-option-on-android-in-the-eu/343073/">default search on Android</a>, Google must now implement a choice screen reminiscent of the browser screen on Windows from back in the day, for all new devices. Meaning that the data mining company presents the customer with more choice, that is ultimately going to make little difference.</p>
<p>Killing these deal will no doubt kill Mozilla, which is a huge shame, but if your company depends on these deals and is yet to make any money elsewhere, perhaps these deals are just preventing the inevitable. I don’t like Google controlling search because they then control access to products such as maps, but more users flocking to Chrome could possibly be worse.</p>
<p>Any company controlling the web is bad news, but when it’s Google it should be avoided at all costs.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>That’s the easy bit right. Sitting in the chair, then you’ve got to sort all your desk out, check out Twitter for a bit, change writing apps 3 times and then what?</p><p>Talking about writing is easy, what’s hard is actually writing anything and hitting publish. Deciding to do things, saying you are going to do things, anyone can do those two parts. Don’t believe me there is a <a href="https://novel.coryarcangel.com/">whole book about it </a>— but are you actually going to do something about it?</p><blockquote>Writing, like so many creative acts, is hard. Sitting there, staring, mad at yourself, mad at the material because it doesn’t seem good enough and you don’t seem good enough. — from “Ego is the Enemy: The Fight to Master Our Greatest Opponent” by Ryan Holiday</blockquote><p>Writing is one of those weird acts that everyone thinks is straightforward, but actually very few people can do consistently. More people should do it and simply stop messing around pretending to write and put something down — on paper, on a web page wherever you want put it — just sit in the chair and then do it.</p><p>There are a million reasons not to do it, not to start, not to carry on, and even more not to hit publish when you are done. You are not good enough, your posts are not getting enough views or even worse your blog doesn’t look like others. Whatever the reason to stop is, you either listen or you get going and publish something. Don’t just talk about it, do it.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>A year or so I wrote about the <a href="https://gr36.com/letting-your-ego-in/">trouble with letting your ego in</a>, what I really should of titled it is when I let <em>my</em> ego in, but stopped short because of well….ego.</p>
<p>It’s easy to write a blog post giving imaginary readers advice like you are someone that should be looked up to. Someone worthy of giving advice that has been learnt from previous mistakes; but my ego is funny like that and makes me think that I am. These types of posts can be easily described in the words of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_as_I_Say_(Not_as_I_Do)">Peter Schweizer’s</a> “do as I say not as I do”. Not only because the advice is often obvious and straightforward, but because I often fall foul of my own words.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Do you know how you can tell when someone is truly humble? I believe there’s one simple test: because they consistently observe and listen, the humble improve. They don’t assume, ‘I know the way.’”</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s easy to claim that your ego is an enemy to be battled, and examples can be given in bucket loads, but until you realise this for yourself it is often impossible to comprehend. Anecdotes that fill self help books, or are spoken about by individuals with a higher purpose are easy to ignore because they simply don’t apply to people like you — until you realise within yourself that they do.</p>
<p>Ego is not simply something individuals should be aware of in triumph or every day life, ego has a huge effect in times of failure and magnifies every mistake. Instead of embracing failure and the lessons that can be learnt, excuses are made because of comparisons to others and nothing is gained. Energy is wasted on thoughts about others, when it should be focused on learning and growing as a person.</p>
<p>Humbleness is one of the most claimed traits in a person, but very small numbers actually show it. It’s easy to claim to be, but showing this in everything you do is much harder. I let my ego in sometimes, as does everyone, but learning from these mistakes makes me a much better person — because you can’t grow and learn if you think you already know.</p>

      <p>When thinking about my smartphone usage I always long for something simpler. A life not filled with beeps and bings, one without a phone at all — but there is always something in the way. A need to be contacted, a reason to have emails pushed to your phone at all hours of the day or a drive to be contactable. So when all reasons in the world seem to conspire against you, at some point something has to give and I wasn’t prepared to change <em>my</em> stance.</p><p>When the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/10/19/148493/smartphones-are-weapons-of-mass-manipulation-and-this-guy-is-declaring-war-on-them/">notion was first posed</a> that smartphone were perhaps too good, I was dismissive. Overly critical at the very idea that a company must make their product worse in order to stop people using it so much. In fact it’s absurd, to think that people don’t have enough self control to sort themselves out and require someone else to do it for them. That reasoning still somewhat exists, but I don’t blame Apple for manipulating me, but I know it is written into the DNA of attention merchant companies.</p><p>It is almost impossible to resist without a hyper conscious focus on resisting the urges they pull on. This isn’t so much about self control, we aren’t dealing with having one too many donuts, these are base urges that are being used against us all. Each and everyone of us.</p><p>So I can hardly be critical when I know it’s happening, I am aware of the tricks and the techniques used — and still fall for them. So those less aware and less conscious about these issues stand no chance whatsoever, but they are hardly going to live without a smartphone without a serious hinderance on their lives. They are so ingrained in us now that in may places I can’t park my car, book a taxi or open my hotel door without needing an app for that. There is no way to go back, not now, not ever.</p><p>So my dream of using something dramatically different is dead, only accelerated by COVID-19 into a world filled with contactless payments, app purchases and smartphone addiction. I might need a smartphone to live, but I don’t need to use it more than essentials, I can remove a lot of usage with some effort.</p><p>My dream of going back has changed, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-really-want.html">my smartphone has changed</a> but my dream is not quite dead — yet.</p>

<p>Last week Chris Wilson opened up his newsletter <a href="https://learncreateshare.substack.com/p/sharing-despite-self-doubt?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNzM5ODM4LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo3NzEwNDYsIl8iOiJUSGJ3YiIsImlhdCI6MTU5NTc1MjAyNiwiZXhwIjoxNTk1NzU1NjI2LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItNDU5NzEiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.gGEKcZ15hKCqzKJR3bfcvlwcTs3LFeGa5IKLdvhIK08">‘Learn, Create, Share’</a> with the following quote.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Your problem,” my brother explained “is the same as mine. We’re bad at self-promotion because we were taught not to be boastful.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Undoubtedly this isn’t <em>the</em> reason I never made it as a writer or content producer, but it is something that I really don’t want to ever do. Sell myself to an online following is great if you can make a living out of it. However building a brand and resorting to clickbait titles, or constant self-promotion online is just not anything I ever want to resort to.</p>
<p>My online persona is the same as my real one, and I don’t see any reason to change. Fair play if that’s your thing, but too often I see great people I follow online build a following and then become boring bots of shameless self-promotion and shape themselves into something different.</p>
<p>Can it be self-promotion if you’re not being yourself?</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Whenever I write <a href="https://notareal.blog/2020/07/27/my-inspiration.html">about my daughter</a> and share it with others they always say how lucky I am to have such an inspiration. That of course <em>is</em> true, but I am lucky enough to in-fact have two of them. Because although our times are hard, and some days difficult to get through, we always have someone at our side to keep us going and that is my son James.</p>
<p>I hate thinking about him as a young carer, but at just 9 he is the most kind and loving person you could ever meet. Since before he could even walk he has fetched things for Lucie, played with her and been her motivation to get up and walk. She only took her first step because she was determined to be just like him.</p>
<p>He shouldn’t have to worry about the things he does at his age, but he does so with a smile on his face and a skip in his step. He has taught me so much already, and made me confident that we can do anything together because if we managed to raise such a brilliant boy I can’t wait for the man he will become.</p>

<p>Newsletters are the new hotness. I know, I write one and you might have heard of it. There are a huge number of fantastic ones out there, providing content direct to your inbox and making good money doing it. So as with everything that starts to take off, every one thinks they can write a paid for newsletter now and unfortunately that just isn’t the case.</p>
<p>So many people are starting one up and asking for money straight off the bat it’s become in a bit of a joke. There is absolutely nothing wrong with monetising your product, be it a blog or newsletter, but you have to put some free work in first. Publishing your work should be the first step, getting consistency and pushing out things that people want to read builds the foundations.</p>
<p>How on earth can I get invested in paying for something if I have no confidence in you consistently publishing things. Spending a small amount of money on something you enjoy reading is a great thing to do, but asking for money upfront without content is a pretty crappy thing to even suggest.</p>
<p>It took more than 10 years of writing to even pay for my blog hosting, although I’m a pretty shitty writer, so monetisation will come, but put out the content for the love of doing first. Don’t ask for money too early because it comes off as needy, and may not turn out the way you think.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>I am currently experimenting with moving all of my social things to micro.blog. I know I have tried <a href="https://gr36.com/youre-not-cool-enough-for-micro-blog/">this before</a> (twice) but this time I don’t want it to be my blog I just want a place to hang out and post everything to. This will mainly be an Instagram replacement, posting checkins as most importantly books and films I have watched.</p>
<p>I can’t quite work out Goodreads yet, but by using <a href="https://letterboxd.com/">Letterboxed</a> I can post watched film easily using <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2017/api-posting/">Micropub</a>. You can of course use this with micro.blog but also with any service that support Micropub, so also applies to WordPress and other more mainstream services.</p>
<h2>Choose your way</h2>
<p>There are two relatively easy ways to do this, one free and one paid, both with pros and cons. They both rely on singing up to Letterboxed, and using your profile RSS feed to post updates. So, whichever you choose, you will need to sign up and then copy your feed address from your profile page. Once logged in, on the menu bar furthest to the right you will notice an RSS icon. Right click and copy this first.</p>
<h2>IFTTT</h2>
<p>This method is completely free so is a win straight off the bat, but as a caveat is a little more complex to set up and I found a little limited to work with. This is personal preference, of course, but IFTTT is still very straight forward to set up.</p>
<p>Click on Create and chose RSS as your IF (the trigger), choose new item in feed and paste in your RSS feed from Letterboxed. The Then (action) part is a Webhook to allow you to post to micropub services. For this example, I am going to run through a micro.blog, but they will all be pretty much the same.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-07-24-at-09.27.01-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/23cd288f5c.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 07 24 at 09 27 01 1" width="599" height="551" border="0" />Make a web request, and then put in the URL of your service, in this case it is <code>https://micro.blog/micropub</code>. Method is POST and content type is usually application/x-form-url-encoded. In the body you need two bits of information, an access code and what you want the post to display. This will be dependent on your device but in my micro.blog case I use the following.</p>
<p><code>access_token=ABCDEF&amp;content={{EntryContent}}&amp;name={{ItemTitle}}</code></p>
<p>With the access token generated in my setting of my micro.blog.</p>
<p>You can customise the body content to whatever you want to display in the post. If you leave this as is, then it will display the raw content of the RSS feed.</p>
<h2>Zapier</h2>
<p>This is a much more rounded service that makes it much easier to customise the post content, but at a cost of £20 per month. For this cost, you get the ability to automate many more things, so it <em>might</em> be worth considering but please bear this in mind.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-07-24-at-09.11.31-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/249f233fa1.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 07 24 at 09 11 31 1" width="1000" height="962" border="0" />Start by creating a new Zap, the trigger is RSS and the event is a new item in the feed, Past in the Letterboxed RSS feed you have saved and that is all you need to do on this step as you don’t need any information to access this feed. On the next step Zapier will find the data — so make sure you’ve at least recorded one watched film, and then pull everything into Zapier.</p>
<p>The action is Webhooks, and the action event needs to be POST to tell micropub to post information. By customising the request you can go as deep as you like, this is where Zapier makes it so easy to post images, ratings and everything the feed contains effortlessly and understandably. To do this put the Micropub url into the first box, in my case this is <code>https://micro.blog/micropub</code> and leave the Payload type and Form.</p>
<p>Click the plus sign under Data, and type <code>content</code> into the first box, and then you can customise the post until your heart is content. Click the plus button again and type <code>access_token</code> into the first box and in the second one copy in an access code from micro.blog. Your service may not require this, but will usually require some kind of authentication.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2020-07-24-at-09.12.01-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7a61b825bb.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2020 07 24 at 09 12 01 1" width="1000" height="919" border="0" />All the other topics can remain as they are by default, by clicking continue you are given the option to test the post. Do this and check that everything appears correctly — you can always go back and change things before re-testing. This is another option that makes Zapier a great service to work with. Once you’re happy, finish everything off and now every time you review a film it will post to Micropub.</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>These kinds of posts usually start out as a small note in my journal or Apple Notes. Sometimes they stay there for quite a while because I am at risk of sounding like a grump old man – and <a href="https://gr36.com/life-through-a-lens/">not for the first time</a>.</p>
<p>However in Lockdown there has been an increase in social media posting that has continued now that things are easing (sorry America). When biking around, or walking with the family there has been a stark increase in people looking at their phones or constantly taking pictures. Posing with things, or shameless self promotion, you know the types of posts I mean.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking photos, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gr36m/">I love it</a>, I take far too many of them – but I don’t miss the world for a shot. When everything on Instagram is fake, what exactly is the point of posting. It’s supposed to be about showing what you are doing, not doing things so you can show them.</p>
<p>Stop missing the world, or watching it through the screen of a phone – put it down and live it.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Yeah, I’m <em>that</em> guy this year. I couldn’t decide which iPhone size I wanted, so I <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1327606056562925569?s=20">got them all</a>. It’s a weird position to be in but also provides me with some deeper insights into the real differences. I am not talking about specs and all those kinds of figures that people get too caught up in, the real things that make a difference to actually using the device. One of the strangest ones I have had to think about this year is the MagSafe wallet — so here is how it fits with each size iPhone.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="MagSafe-Wallet-iPhone-12-Mini-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dab53b524a.jpg" alt="MagSafe Wallet iPhone 12 Mini 1" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<h2>iPhone 12 Mini</h2>
<p>The smallest of the bunch is, somewhat understandably, the worst one regarding the MagSafe wallet. The iPhone 12 Mini is the same width as the wallet and the magnet position mean it goes all the way to the bottom of the phone also.</p>
<p>Meaning no margin for error, but a nice neat look and a perfect fit — in theory. In reality this means it’s the hardest to get on fully, and it’s also the easiest to move off the edge of the phone. The small size of the iPhone 12 Mini also means that it is the hardest to get off when you need to get a card out. Mainly because the only option you have is pushing it down from the top not side to side.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Magsafe-Wallet-iPhone-12-Pro-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/06439a696b.jpg" alt="Magsafe Wallet iPhone 12 Pro 1" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<h2>iPhone 12 Pro</h2>
<p>The best compromise in the sizes of iPhones is arguably the best size to use the MagSafe wallet with. When fitting the wallet you have some room around the phone to position the wallet securely if you don’t get it right straight away. Also some space on the back of the phone to remove the wallet easier when you need to get a card out.</p>
<p>It lacks the neatness of the iPhone 12 Mini, but doesn’t look too bad at all. I have also found that when using the MagSafe wallet on the back of your iPhone 12 Pro or iPhone 12, the phone is easier to hold. I feel much more comfortable using my phone out the house without a case when the wallet is attached enabling a bit more grip.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="MagSafe-Wallet-iPhoen-12-Pro-Max-2.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4adbbe06b7.jpg" alt="MagSafe Wallet iPhoen 12 Pro Max 2" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<h2>iPhone 12 Pro Max</h2>
<p>If you’ve read this far, you’re interested in what the MagSafe wallet is like with the biggest iPhone ever! The iPhone 12 Pro Max is humongous so there is no getting around that the wallet looks, well a bit weird!</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of room around the wallet, given the expansive slab of glass. It also moves around quite a bit when you are trying to use the phone, due to needing significant hand gymnastics. Quite often the MagSafe Wallet will move from side to side, and occasionally making me a little nervous!</p>
<p>The positive is that there is plenty of room for you to move the wallet to the correct position if you get it wrong. However, I would love to see a bigger version for the Pro Max simply so it doesn’t look so lost on the back of the phone.</p>
<p>MagSafe, especially the wallet, feels a little like version one so I am sure we will see revisions on future phones. Stronger magnets and better connections are a must as well as different sized accessories. However, the MagSafe wallet is a great addition to my fairly minimal lifestyle, so I’m pretty happy so far.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Three years ago I was <a href="https://gr36.com/the-amount-of-times-ive-missed-the-dual-camera/">dismissive of the zoom lens</a> that featured on the bigger versions of the iPhone. In part because I didn’t want a bigger phone, in part because the lens didn’t offer me much at that time, and there maybe me talking myself out of spending more money in there too.</p>
<p>Whilst many others, and Apple, have never been dismissive of the ability to get that little closer to your subject, they haven’t given it the attention it really needs. It terms of ability it often comes behind the main (or wide) lens, loosing quite a lot of detail. Although the telephoto lens is improved on the iPhone 12 Pro Max with a bigger sensor and wider ƒ/2.2 aperture, it still seems to lag behind the main sensor.</p>
<p>Yet in stark contrast to my thoughts a few years ago, I think the telephoto lens is used the vast majority of the time. Taping the 2x on the screen gets you a more representative image of what your eye is seeing (at 52 mm equivalent) and gets you closer to what you’re trying to shoot. In many situations it becomes the default.</p>
<p>Portraits, photos with a subject, information shots — in fact pretty much anything other than a landscape or group photo become the telephotos stomping ground. Yet the quality of the shots just don’t stand up to images on the wide lens. I am hoping Apple addresses this going forward, as they clearly see photography as being a huge selling point of the iPhone.</p>
<p>Perhaps next year we will see the larger sensor triple down to the smaller iPhone pro, and the pro max can push on even further by introducing lager sensors and better lenses. Using the iPhone 12 Pro Max for just short time has already proven handy to get a further 0.5x towards a subject I am trying to shoot.</p>

<div>
<p>I am currently trying, and failing quite a lot, to write my iPhone 12 review. Not because it isn’t an excellent phone, but it’s hard to review something that is basically the same as the old one. Cramming in 5g and changing the design to flat sides (why?) aside there is not a lot fundamentally changed. However, this has me thinking about a wider question of separating the iPhone from the iPhone Pro. What exactly is a Pro iPhone?</p>
<p>You tell your mum to buy an iPhone because it’s easy to use, you push the square you get the app. Yet dig a little deeper and you can delve into power features and now with iOS 14 actually start to customise your phone to whole new levels. The iPhone 12 Pro doesn’t change any of these interaction elements, which is both a good and a bad thing. It means that an iPhone feels like an iPhone. You’re using the same iPhone that you see in the hands of powerful people, but you’re also using the same iPhone as everyone else.</p>
<p>The Pro moniker appears to separate these two types of people now, creating a separate brand for those that like shiny things that are the best you can get in an iPhone package. Give those wanting something above and beyond the standard iPhone range, and also something to play into those that yearn for a status symbol. In the same way you see coffee shops littered with £2,000 macBook Pros for writing emails. A Pro for a Pro’s sake.</p>

  </div>

      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><a href="">[youtu.be/G-M13O-ur…](https://youtu.be/G-M13O-urnA)</a></p>
<p>Despite ordering weeks ago, out of the blue my MagSafe Wallet turned up yesterday. I happily posted a picture on Twitter and all of a sudden quite a few people wanted to ask questions about it. So, I thought I might as well answer them all at once.</p>
<h2>How Many Cards Can You Fit In It?</h2>
<p>There is space for three cards to fit, that’s it. No more. However, the case is quite a snag fit so you won’t have any issues using one or to cards in there without them falling out.</p>
<p>There is also obviously no space for money, it’s very minimalist.</p>
<h2>What Colour Did You Get</h2>
<p>I opted for Baltic Blue, which pairs really well with the Pacific Blue iPhone 12 Pro I have, and also the Blue silicone case I occasionally use.</p>
<h2>How Strong Are The Magnets</h2>
<p>The real question we all wanted to know. The short answer is they will be fine. However, the longer one is, probably not as strong as they should be.</p>
<p>When in use I don’t think the wallet will slide off without you knowing about it, but it doesn’t sit nearly as solidly as the iPad Magic Keyboard. Particularly at the bottom it doesn’t take much force to move it around, and when using the phone you can feel it move around some times.</p>
<p>The reality is if you are not paying attention and wearing slim fitting trousers it may come off when you put your phone in your pocket. Using the wallet with a case adds a bit more friction, but I would like to see the address in a future update — I don’t think it is as secure as it should be.</p>

<h2>Can You Charge With It On?</h2>
<p>Nope, not at all, no wireless chargers work with the wallet attached. Not only it is probably too thick, but the wallet is shielded so you don’t ruin your cards, so nothing will get through anyway.</p>

<p>As soon as Apple showed off the iPhone 12 new design I was already dubious about how it would feel in the hand. Flat edges are great to look at, but there is a reason that no one uses them for modern smartphones. Put simply your hands are curved.</p>
<p>Sure the design of the iPhone 4/5 is lauded above all others, and the flat sides are part of that excellent design package, but this was at a time when screens and screen-time counts were much smaller. It still is a truly iconic design, but when your screen is 6.1inches and the phone weighs in at 183g it just doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, some people love the new design. Looking at it from afar it’s easy to see the huge change in design, and how great it looks. However, design has as much to do with function as it does form, and this just doesn’t work in your hand. The edges are uncomfortable, the weight is needlessly excessive, and it hurts my hands to use it.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am spoilt. After using the Pixel 5 and Note 20 ultra, they both feature a great feel it the hand. With the Pixel 5 sporting a similar 6inch screen in a much smaller, more ergonomic package that truly is a wonder to use. Sure it doesn’t feature the same types of materials, but high quality doesn’t mean great design. New users must take this into account when thinking about buying an iPhone 12 Pro especially.</p>
<p>I can understand why the change has been made. The iPad Pro, and new iPad Air, share a similar aesthetic and it’s important to reflect this in your line up. Without changing the design of the iPhone 12, what actually would have been updated from the iPhone 11? Growth at all costs leads to changes for changes sake, and you can claim that the flat design is <a href="https://om.co/2020/10/23/iphone-12-and-why-great-design-is-timeless/">”timeless iPhone design”</a> all you like. The fact remains that the iPhones design was curved for much longer than to was ever flat. For good reason.</p>
<p>The once notorious equal chin and forehead bezels with a round home button could be picked out in a crowed market. This iconic design has been replaced with the notched all screen display. Apple did not need to flatten the edges to make the iPhone stand out, it needed to work harder to build value to the design they have.</p>
<p>Perhaps the iPhone 12 mini will feel much better, perhaps it’s a non issue that people will get used to, and no doubt we will see loads of copycat designs now. However, right here, right now there is a reason other phones are not flat because they are designed to use not to look at. When all is said and done, a £1000 should feel better than this.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>A few times a year these kinds of posts start to appear. Around the time of installing new iOS updates, or getting a new phone, users start to think about what’s on their phone, and new people start to look for apps to use. Here are some of my favourite apps that are my first installs on any new phone.</p>
<h2>Pocketcasts</h2>
<p>I go backwards and forwards on podcast apps, but one that remains my favourite is <a href="https://www.pocketcasts.com/">Pocketcasts</a>. It works brilliantly across platforms, so I can still use it when testing <a href="https://gr36.com/pixel-5-review/">Android devices</a>, but also has a great macOS app and web player.</p>
<p>You’ll have to upgrade to get all the features, but that’s only £9.99 a year and includes a brilliant watchOS app that streams podcasts even better than the stock app. Oh, and it looks awesome too!</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2020/10/Image-1.png" alt="" /></figure>
<h2>Todoist</h2>
<p>Another staple of my daily usage is my task manager of choice, sure I have used others briefly, but it’s been on my device <a href="https://gr36.com/todoist-my-new-app-to-get-things-done/">for years now</a>. There are other apps that look prettier and perhaps have more in-depth customisation but to put it simply I can’t find any other app that can get your tasks from your brain into a plan quicker and easier. <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">Todoist</a> is also cross-platform and works petty much anywhere which is a huge bonus.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2020/10/Image-3-1.png" alt="" /></figure>
<h2>Dark Noise</h2>
<p>Now for something completely different, an app that provides most of my background sound. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/dark-noise/id1465439395">Dark Noise</a> is the app I turn to when working, it not only provides the best ambient sounds around but is also the best designed app I think I have ever seen! The developer <a href="https://twitter.com/_chuckyc">Charlie</a> is all kinds of awesome too.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2020/10/Image-4-1.png" alt="" /></figure>
<h2>Headspace</h2>
<p>When I am not listening to podcasts, or ambient noise I spend at least 20 minutes every day meditating. Headspace is a popular choice for those wanting to work on their mindfulness, and for good reason as its packed full of features. You can get <a href="https://www.headspace.com/register">10 days free to try it out</a> too!</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2020/10/Image-5-1.png" alt="" /></figure>
<h2>Pocket</h2>
<p>Every year, when my subscription comes to an end, I try and find something better to use as a read it later service. Each year I fail. There are cheaper options, there are newer services but I simply can’t find anything better that captures all the text from articles and also surfaces posts about interesting topics. At £35 per year it’s not cheap, but you can use it completely free with a few customisations removed and also a few ads in your article feed.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2020/10/Image-6-1.png" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Honourable mention to <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, <a href="https://hey.com/">Hey email</a>, <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder 5</a> and <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a>. If I have missed something, don’t be shy let me know and <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36">recommend me your</a> favourite apps.</p>

<p>Every iPhone release time everyone starts focusing on the cameras in them. Loads of people go for photo walks and get great shots “with just a smartphone” and even more people start to question the role of a dedicated camera.</p>
<p>That’s because for more than 10 years the smartphone has cannibalised the point and shoot camera market. The reason Apple worked so hard on the original iPhone was because they knew people didn’t want to carry around a phone, iPod and camera, and even perhaps a PDA — and that is still true today.</p>
<p>The best camera is always the one you have with you, and its ability is very tailored to the type of images you are going to take, but also give you the flexibility to use it more in-depth. While phone cameras are great, I take the vast majority of my pictures on them, nothing beats a dedicated camera in my mind. Anything from a simple point and shoot to a DSLR camera will give you much better shots and enable you to do much more.</p>
<p>But the question really is, what do you want out of a camera, and most people just want a nice image they can lay a filter over and post to Instagram. Increasingly users are asking more and more from their cameras though, and the manufactures are needing to lean more and more on algorithms and computational processing to achieve things you can do easily with a dedicated camera.</p>
<p>There is more than a little bias here because I love my A7iii so much, but I don’t think an iPhone will ever get anywhere near even an entry-level Alpha shooter. Couple this with the ability to wonder around somewhere completely disconnected from the world and look for shots means a camera always wins for me.</p>

<p>My shiny thing arrived on Friday. The new iPhone 12 Pro was delivered really early in the morning, and within minutes started to fill me with the feelings that I knew it would. It feels pretty much the same as the last one, and also the one before that, bringing such tiny updates that if they hadn’t changed the edges to flat ones you’d be hard pushed to tell the difference. <em><a href="https://gr36.com/iphone-12-pro-thoughts/">Read more thoughts here</a></em></p>
<p>It doesn’t do anything new for me, apart from hurt my hands. Quite why Apple chose to move the design back to such an unergonomic one I will never know. Apple sold me a dream of owning a new thing that I really needed, but the effect too mere minutes to wear off. I have bought the new iPhone every year since the iPhone 6 and used them all the way through. Not because better phones don’t exist, but because iPhone suits me much better than anything else.</p>
<p>Undoubtably the iPhone 12 Pro is much better than anything else available, but I just don’t enjoy using it. I am not a ‘power user’ — which is a euphemism for use your phone far too much — so I do not need top of the line everything. For the last few months I have been using an iPhone SE as my ‘home’ phone and it is one of the best phones I have ever bought.</p>

<p>I write to you at the end of a horrible two weeks. Even in this position of privilege I have, my eyes have been opened simply by the fact I am not allowed to leave my house. In fact, if you read this on the day it is published, it is my last day inside, and I am just a few hours away from being able to leave the walls of my home — and what a privilege that will feel like.</p>
<p>Due to my father-in-law testing positive (and also being quite ill) we have had to self-isolate for 14 days due to close contact. They are part of our support bubble for Lucie and as such we could have contracted it too. I am glad to say we have been lucky to escape, my mother-in-law has not been so lucky, and everything is fine, but we went through our battle regardless.</p>
<p>Isolating is a weird thing to have to go through. On the surface if it, and indeed looking back at it, we will see that in the grand scheme of things it’s not hard. You have to stay in a place of infinite number of entertainment possibilities. It’s warm, safe and filled full of creature comforts. Simply because you can’t do that one thing, you realise how much you enjoy it.</p>
<p>The first few days are OK, you start to wonder why you wasted so much time with the big wide world when you can get so much done when staying in. DIY tasks are competed, jobs are done and things tidied up. Yet after a while it starts to drag, all I can think about is walking the dog with the wind in my face or the sun on my back. Enjoying the world, and doing nothing more than simply being outside. Tasks I need to complete cannot be done without a trip somewhere or another and the same walls become tiresome.</p>
<p>The garden just doesn’t cut it, I need space to walk and routes to take, I won’t do nearly as much as I could do but simply knowing I can, is comforting. I start to think about how much I go outside, and how much I value but take for granted about it. I think about the liberties that are taken away by those that can’t go out, either by punishment or circumstance and all the possibilities it brings. Many people go through much worse than I, and I am respectful of these situations, but it’s been hard and I don’t want to do it again!</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>I watched most of the interviews at and around <a href="https://www.vox.com/code-conference">the Code Conference</a>, which happened to be around the same time as Meta Connect this year. So my world has been filled full of decrypting what tech CEOs are <em>actually</em> saying. One of the stand-out stars is this open and frank conversation with The Verges Alex Heath and Mark Zuckerberg is well worth <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23889057/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ai-elon-musk-threads-quest-interview-decoder">a listen</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aCg7jH4S1w">watch</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve pulled out some quotes from the transcript I found interesting. I focussed on the first portion of the interview on Threads and ActivityPub because I don’t really have any interest in AI or Metas new products. However, I do care about their open protocol ambitions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an equally important part of designing any product is how it makes you feel, right? What&rsquo;s the kind of emotional charge of it, and how do you come away from that feeling?</p></blockquote>
<p>There was obviously some shade thrown here Elon and twitters way (I am still not calling it X). But there is a lot of truth in what he says about the way people use social networks is often dictated by the way they are designed. He goes on to say that “Twitter indexes very strongly on just being quite negative and critical” which is absolutely true. Not that the designers ever wanted to achieve this, but by leaning into fast-paced, post anything, get engagement from the whole user base, this is always where you end up. Something that gets worse with no work on curation and Elons ‘free speech’ nonsense.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how you seed the networks and the culture that you create there, I think ends up being pretty important for how they scale over time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark and Adam Moseri have the luxury of building a network from the start, bootstrapping it to one of the ones they already have for a user base, and then leaning on their ability to scale up. No other network in history has had this, and Twitter certainly did not have the luxury of creating a culture. Sure, Threads might be building while the plane is in the air, but Twitter is bailing out a sinking ship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a lot of people just don&rsquo;t want to use an app where they come away feeling bad all the time, right? I think that there&rsquo;s a certain set of people will either tolerate that because it&rsquo;s their job to get that access to information, or they&rsquo;re just warriors in that way. They want to be a part of that kind of intellectual combat.</p></blockquote>
<p>As someone who got a lot of value from Twitter for years, and then didn’t any more, I knew exactly what Mark was saying here. It always left me feeling bad about the world, and no amount of curation and blocking could fix it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even when the world is moving towards richer and richer forms of sharing and consumption, I think that text isn&rsquo;t going away, it&rsquo;s still going to be a big thing. But I think how people feel is really important.</p></blockquote>
<p>By all measures, text-based things should be dead by now. So many times have we been told voice first this, short form video that. Yet, text-based interaction just will not die.</p>
<h2 id="activitypub">ActivityPub</h2>
<p>There as a whole load of quotes about ActivityPub and Threads. Many of which cover the same ground, so I might not comment on them all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had our team at various times do the thought experiment of like all right, what would it take to move all of Facebook onto some kind of decentralized protocol? And it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s just not going to happen. There&rsquo;s so much functionality that is on Facebook that it&rsquo;s way too kind of complicated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting that Mark would at least claim to have thought about moving Facebook more open. His statement makes sense, but the constant closing down and siloing of information speaks for itself. I don’t think Mark is lying here, but words are easy to say.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>one of the interesting things that&rsquo;s evolving around this kind of the Twitter competitive space is a lot of the others. There is a real ecosystem around that and I think it&rsquo;s interesting.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>my view is that the more that there&rsquo;s interoperability between different services and the more content can flow, the better all the services can be.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually think that we&rsquo;ll benefit and we&rsquo;ll be able to build better quality products by our products, making sure that we can have access to all of the different content from wherever anyone is creating it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think making it so they can use an alternative but can still interact with people on the network will make it so that that product also is more valuable. You can increase the quality of the product by making it so that you can give people access to all the content even if it wasn&rsquo;t created on that network itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is something encouraging about these statements, but they all feel a little too spun. I think there’s a shed load of advantages to Meta being able to point to ActivityPub interoperability, not least when questioned about timeline sorting and content moderation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>maybe for phase one of social networking, it was fine to have these systems that people felt a little more locked into.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of this funny counterintuitive thing where I just don&rsquo;t think that people like feeling locked into a system. So in a way, I actually think people will feel better about using our products if they know that they have the choice to leave.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is more about enticing people in whilst also letting them consume other&rsquo;s content than it is about users leaving and going elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in a way that actually makes people feel more confident investing in a system if they know that they have freedom over how they operate.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if we can build threads on this, then maybe we can over time, as the standards get more built out, it&rsquo;s possible that we can spread that to more of the stuff that we&rsquo;re doing.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think Meta see themselves as creating something that grows and expands on top of ActivityPub. I’ve said before that they would look to become the ‘blue bubble of new social media’, that offers more if you move to their Federated server – and then they can monetise your attention.</p>
<p>This whole conversation makes me feel more confident than ever that Threads will open up, but just a little. There are numerous moving parts, and they still do not really know where they stand with the EU and being outlined as a ‘<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_4328">gatekeeper</a>’. So it&rsquo;s a wait and see game, just don&rsquo;t hold your breath.</p>

<p>There’s a shared frustration that comes with these posts that is shared throughout my journaling and my photography. That is that my life is pretty mundane and built on load sod routines. My life is not one that social media would find very fascinating, and certainly is not all sunshine and rainbows.</p>
<p>This week, I have been preparing for my birthday and also numerous big projects coming up in my working life. Reflected by feeling as if this is the calm before the storm. I celebrate my 40th birthday (yes, I am <em>that</em> old) on Wednesday and before that, I have two days of kick off meetings. Oh, the joys! I hate my birthdays.</p>
<ul>
<li>Watched two games of the greatest team the world has ever seen (Arsenal), both with amazing atmospheres and great goals.</li>
<li>Celebrated my mother-in-law’s birthday with a visit of all the family to our house, which is where the photo above comes from. Too many kids to count and so much fun playing with their toys. Moments like this make me realise what a huge kid I still am at heart.</li>
<li>Ran just under 10 miles for the first time in a long time on Saturday. Meaning my weekly milage is slowly creeping up. The main issues I have is running more than 2 or 3 times in a week, at which point my body starts to tell me off. It is a struggle, but it&rsquo;s worth it for a great cause – donate to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024">London For Lucie</a>.</li>
<li>Received my iPhone 15 Pro max on Friday. I’ve gone up in size this time, and although I’m still not convinced, <a href="/2023/09/22/no-more-flat.html">the curved sides</a> and Titanium build make it much easier to handle. The zoom lens seems a bit meh, though.</li>
<li>I have been thinking a lot about blogging recently. Why someone would start and blog and the motivations to publish on the internet. A quote from Seth Godin stuck out to me, “ If you’re about to spend time and money and effort to create something, how will you know if it worked? What needs to happen to make it worth it?” The only external metrics you really have are clicks and responses, and it is up to you if you want to measure either of those things.</li>
<li>I managed to leave the sunroof of my brand-new car open last weekend, and, of course, it rained. There were some choice words muttered to myself, but it’s being repaired and should be back with me shortly. Mistakes happen, I guess, but the stress could have been avoided. I know how to make the sunroof shut when I lock the car now!</li>

     <p>Before myself and Nati recorded the first episode of <a href="https://toppodcast.com/podcast_feeds/bring-your-own-device/">bring your own device,</a> we made promises to each other. To be honest about everything. To be Apple fans, enjoy Apple devices but not be Apple apologists. To not be another voice in the sea of Apple bloggers that spent most of their time explaining why your opinions are wrong.</p>
<p>Sadly, the podcast no longer exists, but that idea that was core to everything we talked about stuck with me. I’ve never shied away from calling out mistakes from Apple, and <a href="/2017/10/25/not-being-a.html">tried very hard to not fall into fanboy traps</a>. This is an extremely long-winded way of setting up a way to say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l28UAs30Jjk&amp;t=101s">I was right</a> about the iPhone 12 design all along!</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c28e0726d5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I made a (feeble) video about the design almost as soon as I felt it because I was amazed at the massive step back. I read in amazement all the words that were then written to defend it. Claiming that it was a brilliant design, and perhaps I was “holding it wrong” (again). There is nothing wrong with opposing opinions, and some people seemed to genuinely like the update, so I did question myself a little.</p>
<p>However, the iPhone 15 smoothed out edges make me feel vindicated. Even more so when the same people telling everyone that the design was great, are now saying the iPhone 15 update is much better. There is absolutely no denying it. A combination of the curved edges, the titanium frame and the slightly slimmer bezels make the phone feel much smaller than it actually is.</p>
<p>I’ve gone up to the max this year with zero regrets now this phone actually fits in my hand! My pinky would like to formally thank Apple designers for thinking about the shape of human hands.</p>

<p>The frantic realisation that I hadn’t written my weekly post happened about 20 minutes ago. Not that anyone cares but with all the excitement of Apple announcements it completely slipped my mind. So excuse the two week update of what I’ve been up to. Weirdly mostly tech related.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordered the new iPhone 15 pro. This year I am moving up to the max because I’m old and want a bigger screen and this is now my only camera so I want the best one.</li>
<li>Skipped the watch updates. Nothing beats my current Ultra and a processor bump will not make me part with another £850.</li>
<li>Running just over 10k consistently now. My lungs are still and issue but mainly after my run. Please donate to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024">London for Lucie</a>.</li>
<li>Happy to have Matt Birchler on board with the stock <a href="https://youtu.be/7KMYKoDiIiU?si=hWB7S0-IsOaFVlsh">Apple podcast app</a>. Nothing works as well over several Apple devices and although it’s not perfect the iOS17 beta makes it even better.</li>
<li>My son may be disappearing to Spain for a week next year as part of a school event. Super proud of his dedication to his school work and being an awesome human being.</li>
<li>Everyone is back at work now and the house is quiet all week while I work from home. Almost makes me want to visit the office. Almost.</li>
<li>I bought and returned a Pixel fold last week. It’s just <a href="/2023/09/11/its-not-for.html">not for me</a> in the slightest. A poor phone and an even worse table rolled into on very nice but lacking device.</li>
<li>We have lots of hospital appointments coming up so this week will be a busy one. All of Lucie appointments come around at once and it always sucks. Hopefully I don’t forget to write stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>Continue to be awesome, and that’s an order but make sure you take it very easy my friends.</p>
<p>🤙</p>

<li>15, has zoom, probably buy this one</li>
<li>Pro, more zoom but only max.</li>
<li>Watch, there’s a new one</li>

     <p>There is nothing more polarising in the social media circles I travel in than iPhone announcement day. It brings out the worst in people from both sides, particularly the rampant consumerism and fanboy gloating. However, the thing that annoys me most is the snark that also appears.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with a casual ribbing. Might I suggest that fact that it took Apple 5 years to implement USB-C? Or that Apple claims things like 5x zoom is cutting-edge technology? Choose these things, and you might even find a fanboy to argue back with you for internet points. Though, I’d much rather you let people enjoy what they like and get on with it.</p>
<p>This isn’t restricted to tech, but it seems to bring out the worst tribalism in people. Whenever England are playing football, you see hundreds of posts similar to “yay sportsball”. Obviously, with less tactful word choice. In the same way, people can enjoy watching an Apple event without being a blinded consumerist sheep. They can also enjoy a game of national football without being a hooligan.</p>
<p>The fact that I even need to explain this to people makes me a little sad. Even more so, that I almost wrote a blog post explaining why I am buying a new phone. Undoubtedly, there are people that overstretch themselves to upgrade when they really don’t need to. Marketing and perceived societal pressure can influence some silly choices. The idea of making people more aware that they don’t need to upgrade is important. However, the holier than thou attitude isn’t.</p>
<p>We all enjoy weird and wonderful things in our life. I certainly have some things that others think are odd, but it brings me joy, and that shouldn’t matter to anyone else. I’m a big believer in loving what you love, and <a href="/2021/06/12/hate-what-you.html">hating what you hate</a>, but you don’t need to press those things on anyone else. Be constructive, not destructive.</p>

     <p>I read a recent <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/i-tried-to-use-apples-calendar-app-but-i-ran-back-to-fantastical/">post by Matt Birchler</a> talking about his experiment with going back to Apple’s stock calendar. It sparked in me thoughts about my recent switch (well a few months ago) and I thought I would share my experiences. Not that my lowly blog needs to lend credence to the amazing Matt Birchler, but it is often helpful to see more than one person pointing to the same things.</p>
<p>With that said, Matt and I have very similar jobs. One full of meetings, team catch-ups and projects to complete. I am sure he also has a fair share of family things to keep up with too, and I have all sorts of appointments and meeting for <a href="/2022/08/03/lucie-loves-her.html">my daughter</a> to contend with. So the benefits felt by perhaps one side of life for some people very much bleed into every part of mine.</p>
<p>For me, my calendar is my entire life and <a href="/2019/11/20/how-i-use.html">has been for some time</a>. When people turn their noses up at a subscription for “just a calendar app” I do understand. However, I get so much value from Fantastical, it is money I gladly hand over. You see, I <em>could</em> (and have) get by with the stock app, but I’m much better off with Fantastical. You might ask why, and that’s why you’re reading this post, so let me try to break it down for you without being too repetitive.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/22a9c87b11.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="meetings-and-integrations">Meetings And Integrations</h2>
<p>The pandemic accelerated my already increasing number of virtual meetings. Something I don’t really mind because I’d rather be working from home than traveling all over the place. For some reason, every company seems to use a different method for these, so I have to meet with SEO experts on Google meet, internal conversations on Teams and then move to chatting with event organisers on Zoom. Fantastical makes this a breeze. I don’t need to install loads of apps all over the place, just sign in with all of my accounts and click the join meeting button in my calendar.</p>
<p>Fantastical also integrates with my task manager of choice, Todoist, as well as my Office 365 work calendar, my shared iCloud calendar with my wife and even Meet Up for some sudo socialising! By having everything in one place, I can see all of my tasks scattered across the various platforms all in one full list. Not many apps allow numerous services to be integrated and work together as if they were all in the same place. This works on mobile too by selecting tasks in the top left menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8f102193a5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="time-boxing">Time Boxing</h2>
<p>Which leads me to my next major feeling point for Fantastical, time boxing is life changing. I first noticed this with Josh Ginter <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/fantasticals-duplicate-as-event-has-changed-my-time-blocking-routine/">writing about this for Sweet Set Up</a>, and it was the thing that inspired me to go all in on a better calendar app. As you can see from my screenshots, I block out time in my calendar to complete certain types of tasks all at once. Placing DND into areas that I don’t want to be disturbed – but I can do that in any calendar app Greg, I hear you say. Indeed, you can, but the customised colours and <a href="https://flexibits.com/blog/2021/01/getting-started-with-templates/">templates you can set up</a> make this easy to set up and understand with a glance.</p>
<p>This is where two things come into play and make time boxing effortless for me when using Fantastical. I can look at the upcoming weeks calendar and already all tasks with due dates are present. I can then begin to plan around them, blocking out my day to make sure I know how much spare time I have and what kind of tasks will dominate those days. Pressing CMD + R brings up a list of all the tasks I have outstanding, and I can simply drag these into the places that I have blocked out. For example, above are periods where I have blocked out designing time, and in this 4–5 hours I can get several design focused tasks completed.</p>
<p>Granted, I understand that these things might not make a difference to you. To be honest, there was a long time when I thought they didn’t for me, and now I couldn’t be without it. Fantastical saves me more than the cost of the subscription in time and effort, but I understand it is not for everyone.</p>

     <p>I love to try new things. To push the limits of where I am settled and see if new technology can help me out. This usually revolves around phones and for a long time I was, a phrase I coined, a phonehobo. I just moved around all over the place and never had a home. The constant release of Android phones in the early 2010s meant that there was no shortage of new things to try and the constant promise of the new one being the best.</p>
<p>Now I am settled into using iOS devices, I know that the Workflows I have built up and the apps I enjoy using are right for me. That doesn’t, however, stop me trying things out even so often, and if you’ve followed me for more than five minutes you will have seen my occasional dalliance with Android phones. Most of these dalliances are to make sure I don’t fall into the trap of being a fanboy, and can appreciate that different, and at times better, things exist.</p>
<p>Each time I decide to try one, I have the same ideas in my head. That the device will offer me a bit more than my trusty iPhone, and a return of the excited feeling I got every time I unboxed a new Nexus or Galaxy device in the distant past. Yet, a day or so into using them, I rediscover that Android is just not for me.</p>
<p>I like Android. I think it’s a great OS, and each update that Google release makes me wish I could use it. There are no issues with the hardware either, bar the camera, many of the handsets I try match Apple build quality and some are even better. There’s not <em>one</em> big reason why I always go back, there are just lots of little paper cuts that make the decision for me. Small things that I can’t get used to or just don’t work the way I want them to, and no amount of me forcing the issue will change that.</p>
<p>There are numerous things in life that are not for me. Mechanical keyboards. Red wine sauce. Anime movies. I just need to accept that Android is another one of those things. There is a comfort in being comfortable with yourself, maybe I should give that a try!</p>

     <p>I take loads of notes. Like a serious amount, that at some points it seems a bit unhealthy. I enjoy writing everything down for later use, and over the years it has proven invaluable numerous times. I like the process of doing it, I like to remember things, so I read them back, and I use them in personal and work related projects on a daily basis. This isn’t a post to polish my ego or anything. ”oh look at me, the perfect little notetaker” – it just sets the scene so to speak.</p>
<p>There are a few times that this habit has sucked the joy out of activities. It <a href="/2023/01/15/i-tried-to.html">ruined podcasts</a> for a little while, for instance, but I soon worked out my workflow and what I wanted to achieve. As I wrote about in my linked post above, there is a tendency in the modern world to want to hack everything. To squeeze and shape all the things in your life to get the most out of it. There’s a time to be efficient and proactive, but not with the things you enjoy. Those things are to slow down and enjoy the most.</p>
<p>There’s a benefit to subscribing to services like <a href="https://www.blinkist.com">Blinkest</a> and cramming in all the information you can get your hands on. There is also. Time to slow down, flip through the pages of a good back and enjoy the moment. Some people get immense benefit from listening to audiobooks or podcasts at 2x speed, and then there are other <a href="/2019/04/29/skipping-silence.html">that enjoy the pauses</a> and <a href="/2021/03/14/the-importance-of.html">the silence</a>, and want to dwell on the words.</p>
<p>I am in the camp of slowness. Of savouring what you enjoy, or benefiting from the things you do the most. I write things down in a <a href="/2023/05/17/get-a-notebook.html">notebook</a>, with a pencil! I don’t need to hack my brain with a Personal Knowledge Management system because I just write things down, and I read them. Likewise, I go over some of the things that I read and listen to (not all of them) for nothing more than to enjoy them again and remember the things they say.</p>
<p>I value the people that rush around and hack all the things, but this not me, and I am totally at peace with that. One is not better than the other, they are just two sides of the same story that is modern life.</p>

     <p>A recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22410374/julia-galef-book-scout-mindset-interview-think">Vox Conversations</a> episode brought me towards a book about <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/305/305779/the-scout-mindset/9780241308325.html">scout mindset</a>. This is the basis of making your mind more inquisitive to look for information and understand everything fully instead of defending your beliefs.</p><p>I wrongly presumed that this was obvious to everyone, and then immediately realised that I was defending my static position already. I started to think about what happens when your beliefs become so ingrained in you that they become part of your personality. Are you the Apple guy? The Android girl? The iPad dude?</p><p>When your very person is framed by something you believe in, how can you ever hope to look at anything with a scout mindset. I’ve been guilty of this in the past, and projected my own bias onto many different things. We all have these things in us that we believe in, but the real thing to take away from this approach is to be mindful of them and make sure it doesn’t cause you to miss any information or mean you’re defending your position because you feel like it’s personal.</p><p>Beliefs don’t have to be permanent.</p>

<p>Of course over the last few weeks I have been going backwards and forwards over podcasting again, but this is not more rumination. Instead it is emotion towards lost relationships, at least one sided ones.</p>
<p>During my 5 years working around the UK I spent a rough average of 5 hours a day driving, often much more. This time was always filled with podcasts. Each time I turned the key, after a few seconds pause my trusty Ford CMax (I had three of them in a row) was filled with my chosen episodes.</p>
<p>Hours and hours of my life I spent listening to Podcast personalities that taught me so much. They were my introduction to tech, to working on an iPad, my glimpse into brand new ways of thinking and new topics for me to become interested in. As the miles rolled on, I devoured whole episodes of my favorite shows over and over. The hosts shared personal insights with me, and we built up and very one sided relationship. I felt invested in them as podcasts and also individuals.</p>
<p>When my working life changed these dropped away, and as COVID hit they disappeared completely. These relationships my mind had built were severed and almost all of which I have no interest in now. It was only when compiling a list of <a href="/2021/05/12/my-podcast-feed.html">my podcast feed now</a> that I realised how many people have slipped out of my life.</p>
<p>I am filled with a strange melancholic feeling towards these shows and people. I am thankful for everything I have learnt and the interests I have found, but realised this was all one sided. All of a sudden understand people that become obsessed with people from TV shows than mean something to them.</p>

<p>I’ve changed my morning routine little by little over the last few weeks and it has made a huge difference.</p>
<p>I feel like I am stealing the idea a little, because Matt D’Avella made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIIGCTIpRMk&amp;t=198s">brilliant video about small changes</a> at the end of last year which inspired me so I cant take the full credit.  However after months of searching on how to put good habits into my life, it seems I have found the answer — slow and steady wins the race.</p>
<p>Introducing small, achievable things to do each day is the key to making much bigger changes in your life. I started with small things like meditate and go for a walk, setting a reminder each day and ticking them off. This soon evolved into exercising each morning and walking the dog before 7am by just moving slowly.</p>
<p>I have always wondered why people get obsessed by successful peoples morning routines. Perhaps they are trying to find something in them that will change their own life and make them successful too. This is bonkers, but I am in a different mindset to morning routines now. You don’t need to go all out, but changing small things can really set you up for the day. I was in no rush to change everything and not be able to keep it up, but just one new thing every couple of weeks has been a huge revelation.</p>
<p>What small, achievable thing could you do to improve your day?</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s been a while since I listened to podcast as intently as I used to. Somewhere in 2019 I fell off a bit as I didn’t have to drive as much, and the pandemic <a href="/2020/10/18/podcasts-and-me.html">just killed almost all of my listening</a>. The empty space I used to fill with talking and chatting about tech is not just empty but I’t still consuming up a little <a href="/2021/02/15/why-do-i.html">while running</a> or walking the dog. Chris Wilson <a href="/2021/02/15/why-do-i.html">pestered me into</a> writing about what I am listening to, so here it is!</p>
<h2>Wired UK</h2>
<p>The only Tech thing I listen to now is a good round up of tech news that is actually interesting. It got a bit too much in the pandemic due to talking about research and related things to do with COVID but its back to its best. No spec stuff, no wild rumors to get emotional about, just stories and insight about how tech is changing the world. If you like the magazine, you’ll <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/podcasts">love the podcast</a>.</p>
<h2>Duncan Trussell Family Hour</h2>
<p>My favorite person, perhaps on the planet (don’t tell my wife) never fails to entertain. With in-depth talk about life, reality, religion, psychedelics and almost anything goes. His insight into how he looks at the world has affected me deeply since discovering him on Joe Rogan a few years ago – <a href="http://www.duncantrussell.com">I never miss an episode</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c35764757c.jpg" width="666" height="307" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Vox Conversations</h2>
<p>This is a new one for me, I have only been listening a couple of weeks but have gone back and devoured a lot of the back catalog. It’s very political in places, and offers a very slanted view of the world, but has introduced me to some really good books and interesting people. I particularly enjoyed the recent episode on <a href="https://www.vox.com/vox-conversations-podcast">Satanic conspiracies in the US</a>.</p>
<h2>Tim Ferris</h2>
<p>What more is there to say about this podcast, it’s really great. I do dip in and out due to not having the attention or time for a 2hour + conversation but they are always a great listen. Tim has a great way of interviewing and bringing the very best our of people. His <a href="https://tim.blog/2020/10/27/yuval-noah-harari/">show with Yuval Noah Harari</a> changed my outlook on life completely.</p>
<h2>Darknet Diaries</h2>
<p>If you’re following me and not <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com">listening to Darknet</a> I don’t know what you’re doing with your life. This is one of my very favorite. It scratches my tech itch but in a completely different way. The story telling behind some of the greatest hacks in the world, and also some you’ve never heard of ,never fails to grab me.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  They really don’t care what employees have to say. If they don’t think it’s an issue, it’s not an issue
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of all the words in this excellent write up these speak volumes to me. We’ve all seen this arrogance recent years, the ego that runs amok in the founders comes and bites them on the ass.</p>
<p>When you don’t listen to feedback, when you think all your ideas and experiences are the only ones that matters, you have a real issue. Running a company in your vision and being thick skinned enough to stand by your decisions is one thing. But when the success goes to your head and you become tone deaf to everyone but the chip on your shoulder sooner or later that will catch up to you.</p>
<p>I am in no doubt Basecamp is not going anywhere, there will be thousands of people itching to take over these positions that don’t care. They just want a foot in the door. However if this knock tells the founders one thing, it should be that they are not as great as they think they are. Listening to people doesn’t mean you take the advice or feedback, but means you must at least appreciate where your employees and users are coming from.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  During the pandemic, he says, many people have sought comfort in the snacks they remember from childhood. “We went into the store, and we started buying products we hadn’t had since we were kids,” he says — recalling “great joyous moments.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s only when you step back and look around when buying food you realise that a sorry state the world is in.</p>
<p>Our brains and bodies have been hacked by nostalgic food, bright colours and gimmicks to a point of almost no return. A point further highlighted by the pandemic as we all reached for something that made us feel better and take our mind of the doom and gloom.</p>
<p>This is fine in the short term but when you look at all the psychology used by brands it’s reminiscent of social media manipulation. The whole world is out to sell us something and to hell with the repercussions.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I don’t need to resort to tropes to tell anyone how hard the last year has been. Since COVID-19 hit the UK like a train (no political discussion please) we’ve been in lockdown longer than I can ever remember. This has been hard on us all, but one for the weird consequences of this has been my contact with other people. I’ve only been able to see the outside world through Social Media — and that sucks!</p>
<p>I’ve spoken before about missing just being around others, and the <a href="/2020/08/20/missing-a-good.html">lack of physical contact</a> that I think humanity needs to survive. I have been talking, interacting and looking at everyone though the smokey lens of the online world for so long I forgot how great people actually are.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get disillusioned about the way of the world. More so when your bombarded with the worst that it has to offer, what feels like a constant stream of bad news and outrage with some random conspiracies thrown in for good measure. It’s only when getting back to some semblance of normal that it all starts to make sense. As the country opens back up again, I can now start to talk to people in person. Laugh and joke almost like old times that you begin to realise that the world is a much more positive pace when you remove all the digitals in between.</p>
<p>There is nothing like real people, in a real situation that brightens things up. Makes humanity seem great again and improve the despair felt when staying at home. I’ve got through the latest lockdowns with a few scrapes and metal bruises but being able to get out and about again is brilliant. These Smokey lens I have looking at the world through have been lifted, and I am forever grateful.</p>

     <p>Despite it being a standard feature in many Android phones it took Apple until the iPhone XS to implement <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT209044">a dual sim of sorts</a>. Even then you need to have one as an eSim and that limits the networks that can support it. Thankfully EE were one of the first, so for the last few years I have been using two sims in my iPhone, one for work and one for personal.</p>
<p>One major pain is dealing with moving phones. I do that quite a bit, so ordering a paper EE eSim each time became a pain, not to mention an expense at £1.50 a time. Preplanning helps a little, but there has still been times I’ve been without service because I’ve broken my phone and can’t just pop my sim in another.</p>
<p>Thankfully EE have a solution, and you can now download an EE eSim for your iPhone in seconds! Here’s how to do a digital EE eSim swop.</p>
<p>You will need your current sim to be working to receive a text message, and also have already set up your new handset and downloaded the <a href="https://ee.co.uk/ee-and-me/my-ee-app">My EE app</a>.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e6f6966773.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Once you’ve done that on your new phone in the My EE app, open the menu and go to Settings &gt; Device and SIM &gt; Replace my SIM &gt; and select your number.</p>
<p>You will then have two options on supporting devices, SIM card — Post (2 to 4 days) at a cost of £1.50. Or eSim — instant download at a cost of 50p.</p>
<p>Tap on eSim, then select this device, and you’ll be on your way to transferring your number.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2e4f4fff01.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>You will then get a notification that the eSim is ready to download, and then you can go through the normal set up options. This gives you the facility to choose labels for the numbers, which iMessage number is used and lots of others. Once completed you will need to activate the new sim by receiving a text to your old phone, put the supplied code into the app on your new phone, and you’re ready to go.</p>
<p>This is usually instant but can take up to  an hour, turn your new phone off and on again to refresh everything, and you’re good to go on your new handset with a new EE eSim.</p>
<p>Head into Settings &gt; Mobile data to change any of the options you’re selected on set up. If in any doubt call 150 from a working EE phone.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  I can see reviews coming a mile away claiming that the M1 chip is overkill for the iPad Pro and that it isn’t worth the same price as the MacBook Air, or that users should save money on the iPad Pro and just get the MacBook Air instead. As of right now, I can’t come up with any new arguments on behalf of the iPad than I had before this announcement. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>I can’t point at anything that moves the needle on being compelled to buy a new iPad. Even when compared to the 2018 version your pretty much getting the same thing, bar a camera and mini LED on the 12.9”.</p>
<p>I’m not sure either of things are needed by most people that use an iPad, but that’s a personal thing. No doubt the M1 is amazingly powerful but nothing changes at the moment. We keep holding our breath for a sea change in usability from iPad OS. Yet each you comes and goes with nothing bar a few tweets or changing the <a href="/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html">multitasking again</a>!</p>
<p>I’m not even sure what that is. Where does Apple go with iPad OS without compromising more than they add in? I’m lost for ideas but please Apple. Do something. Shock me. Surprise me. Make a £1000 investment worth it.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Following Apples move to offer Podcasters subscriptions to help increase revenue for podcasters, and also grab some cash for themselves, the doors will begin to slam shut. Granted we’ve already seen some try and muscle into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515840/luminary-podcast-startup-proxy-server-show-takedown">exclusive podcasts</a>, Spotify tries to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52736364">tie up some creators</a> and podcast producers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17314866/pocket-casts-podcast-app-acquisition-npr-wnyc-wbez-this-american-life">buy up applications</a>, but I have a feeling it’s going to get a lot worse.</p>
<p>Instead of offering something built on top of a secure RSS feed, Apple have chosen to close it down entirely. Should you choose to make your Podcast more premium and charge your listeners, you will have to upload the audio straight to Apple. Closing off any chance of the show being available in another app, and removing RSS entirely.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5425e7bf4c.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Anchor The Feed</h2>
<p>I am no lover of podcast platform Anchor, and have been outspoken about their practices, but this <a href="https://mignano.medium.com/podcasting-rss-openness-and-choice-50223b1f16d0">recent post</a> from its founder seems to be the most sensible move. Instead of launching a service to tie everything down, he talks about the love of the openness of the RSS-based industry, but also the issues that comes with it.</p>
<p>Each platform that hosts content will have no choice to make a grab for premium content creators. Not because that is who they should be appealing to, but because they can’t miss out on it. Left unchecked Apple could not only take money from subscribers. They will also cut out advertisers, hosting platforms and even apps in their own App Store.</p>
<p>It’s understandable that <a href="https://ljpuk.net/2021/04/22/its-time-to-leave-anchor/">some podcasters</a> will start to get a bit jumpy, but most of these things are motivated by continued attempts to control the market. Open podcasting won’t go away, but the type of content that is available for free, or indeed in the place you want to consume it <em>will</em> dry up over time. We are well and truly in the boom time of audio focused content, which after a year of stalling due to COVID-19 could be a refreshing change.</p>
<p>However, I have a feeling the market will right itself. This has happened to TV, video and blogging before, but there was still enough out there to consume. Perhaps those of us that have been listening for years have just had too much time in the sun? I don’t believe its time to get worried, there are a huge number of podcasters out there that are working away for free that deserve to be better supported. It’s time to wait and see, and support the creators you think need it most.</p>

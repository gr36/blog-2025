  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I would consider myself a pretty athletic guy, I have done various martial arts during my life — as well as completing marathons and exercise regularly. I at least thought I was doing the best for my health and my body, until the Apple watch came along that is. Since strapping the watch to my wrist I have had my eyes opened to a new world of activity and all because of three coloured circles.</p>
<p>I’m also no stranger to the health effects of technology, writing a long piece on the dangers of technology breading a sedentary life style. With an office job I was well aware that sitting for long periods of time was bad for my body. Unfortunately for millions of people world wide, with office jobs you have work to do and often hours blend together and you simply don’t realise how stationary you are.</p>
<h2><strong>Still Seated</strong></h2>
<p>In fact many don’t realise how seated we all are full stop, according to research by Sanlam Private Investments those of us with an ‘office job’ spend up to five years of our lives at a desk. With most workers spending up to 8 hours a day seated, other than the very occasional (and short) movement around the office.</p>
<p>Home time would come and before any more sitting, hitting the gym for an hour of going for a run would feel like it swept all the health issues aside and also allowed me to unwind. Unfortunately for me and probably millions of others that just simply wasn’t the case, unless I was building my mileage up for a marathon the health benefits of after work exercise were in-fact negligible — at best I was standing still.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for people like me the Journal Circulation: Heart Failure has revealed that those who sit for more than five hours a day have an increased risk of around 34% of heart failure. Regardless of how much exercison or exercise done once you have clocked off for the day.</p>
<h2><strong>Tri Colour Tormentor</strong></h2>
<p>Apple have made a big deal about the health benefits they wish the watch to have, <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/watch/health-and-fitness/">adverts and marketing</a> a like have highlighted it becoming more than just a watch. The truth is it really is for me at least. I still have a hard time recommending others to purchase an Apple watch — but for me it is exactly what I need.</p>
<p>Three colour circles have shown me the way, on a larger scale than I ever thought possible. It sounds strange doesn’t it — filling little level meters for no good reason other than to prove you can do it. If I am extra specially good I even get a shiny award, but that pales in comparison to the three completed circles displayed proudly on my wrist.</p>
<p>Granted the Apple watch is far from the only thing that shows you activity levels like this. The same system on Google Fit had a similar effect in building desire to complete an hours worth of activity each day, but for some reason having it strapped to my wrist amplifies the effects and I find myself standing up when I am told off by the tapping on my wrist — even I have no need to I just find something to stand up for.</p>
<p>Its a small addiction now, but it is only affecting my life and my body in positive way. It sounds strange coming from someone that is already active, but the Apple watch has spurred me to do even a little exercise on those days I really cant be bothered to — all to complete my circle.</p>

<p>The only hope for humanity is that Google retain its “don’t be evil” unofficial mantra. If they ever slip, manage to appoint a tyrannical CEO or frankly just change their model we are all in for it! Google spends it’s days indexing the world and the web, both for current and future purposes — but it now wants to back up your entire life.</p>
<p>Google have been granted a patent to <a title="patent to live record experiences" href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=33&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=Google.ASNM.&amp;OS=AN/Google&amp;RS=AN/Google">live record experiences</a> using a wearable computing device for later playback. This might not seem a big step — they already do similar things with static photos backed up into its magical cloud, but if this latest patent is any indication of intention we are all heading for a weird future. Whats more Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror should be held up as some kind of prophecy instead of entertainment.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with the UK TV show Black Mirror, it features an examination of modern society and depicts a future ravaged by the effects of technology. Proceed directly to series 1 episode 3 “the entire history of you” and you will see how exactly live recording everything in your life might play out.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Set in an alternative reality where most people have a ‘grain’ implanted behind their ear that records everything they do, see or hear. This allows memories to be played back either in front of the person’s eyes or on a screen, a process known as a ‘re-do’.” — Wikipedia, The entire history of you</p></blockquote>
<h2>Google brain</h2>
<p>Proof, if it were needed, that Google intends to slowly move more and more of our brain into the cloud. Solving bar arguments, finding a picture you took in 2001 easily and now remembering what your wife’s expression was when asked a question at 11:00am on June 10th 4 years ago. All live ‘experiences’ will be stored and searchable with user questions like “Who were the people at the business lunch this afternoon?”, or “What films did I watch last month?</p>
<p>Although filing for a patent doesn’t show immediate launch or even the ability in producing this technology. It does show at least a small amount of intention, possibly giving another usage to future versions of its Glass platform. This kind of technology could prove invaluable to enterprise or security organisations with the right implementation — however would privacy issues stop any kind of public use?<br />
Humans just are not made to remember everything, we are fragile and complex individuals with different abilities. Black Mirror hits at the dystopian future but each episode is well inside the realms of possibility — our brains are already much shallower than they used to be, could they be pretty useless soon?</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2015/06/10/an-apple-streaming.html"><h1 class="p-name">An Apple Streaming Service Was Unavoidable</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>For millions and millions of mobile users iTunes is inseparable from music. Since the birth of the iPod Apple’s platform supplies anything they wish to listen to — all be it 99p per track at a time. Unfortunately for Apple much as the 8 track, the cassette tape and the CD before it; the digital download began to die.</p>
<p>The portrayed impression is that increased demand for streaming services such as Spotify and GMAA, as well as on demand services such as YouTube have shifted the music industry completely. Retail based best selling charts that once relied on visiting a store with shelves full of singles shifted to only count downloads.</p>
<p>Even without anecdotal evidence Nielson Entertainment figures released just before Apple flicked the switch, show a fundamental change in music consumption. Whether it be from the influence of more illegal music avenues, or the tend for on demand everything — the streaming service(s) became king.</p>
<h2>Don’t Cross The Streams</h2>
<p>In the first half of 2015, Americans streamed twice as much as ever before — consuming 35 billion songs or music videos. With digital purchases falling 10.4 percent to 531.6 million, combined with overall album sales (either physical or digital) down 4 percent to only 116 million units.<br />
￼<br />
So Apple’s answer was the sincerest form of flattery — Imitation. Take one music streaming platform — add content from Spotify and expand until sufficient coverage. Mix in drive storage options from Google Music all access and warm until 10,000 songs. Once complete add in radio functions for live radio and serve in your own packaging — implement social network to your own tastes.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Obviously, the streaming piece is really great news, when you’re talking about darn near 100 percent growth … with no new players” — Dave Bakula, senior vice president of Nielsen Entertainment, told Re/code</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple clearly didn’t have a choice to move to a streaming platform, the resultant hybrid is not without its issues. When you put as many services into on app such as music streaming, uploaded music and also purchased music invariably some things are going to bump, overlap and have some teething problems.</p>
<p>Even with the promise of cross platform apps — Apple Music is not meant to be attractive to anyone other than iPhone users that pay for a streaming service currently, or at least entertain the idea. Whatever your thoughts on Apple Music a first party service on a platform that ships at a rate up to 70 million a quarter make the <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/06/08/rumor-claims-apple-wants-to-reach-100-million-subscribers-for-apple-music">rumoured aim of 100 million users</a> seem entirely possible.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">

<p>Since journeying back to using my iPhone more than anything else I have been stuck in term of wearables. My Moto 360 or G Watch R have been invaluable to me in daily life, allowing me to filter emails from work or just spend less time checking my phone. The pebble is great and all but it just doesn’t cut it when compared to Android Wear.</p>
<p>So I had a choice, learn to live without or stump up and buy an Apple watch, well if you clicked on the link to bring you here you already know I did the later. Unfortunately as I didn’t get in on the initial rush I had to wait for July if I wanted one from Apple — thats never going to happen if you know me.</p>
<p>Luckily I managed to find a reasonably priced one close by, in between the others that expected £600 for a 38mm version! I picked it up yesterday and I have been wearing it 24 hours. Yes I hate these attempted reviews done far to early to, but enough people asked me for some views that I put some down in ink pixels.</p>
<h2>Cost Effective</h2>
<p>The biggest wow factor I have had already is unboxing the watch, I have gladly paid more than £200 for an Android Wear watch already. However I felt cheated out of the money then, it was made out of plastic and presented like a technology company playing at making a watch.</p>
<p>Everyone knows Apple take pride in the boxing and packaging, but included in the high quality packaging is a travel box for the watch which feels great quality. Along with the usual charge cables, which feel premium and the plug is the best designed adaptor I have ever seen! Unboxing this felt like an experience in itself, I had spent the money and more than other watches it felt worth it.</p>
<h1>Running Long</h1>
<p>In its very short time with me the watch has been through the whole range of uses, answering calls and texts, through some circuit training and also been for a run. So as I sit here at 48% battery I think it’s done pretty well, I would be clinging onto 20% battery with a Moto 360 — that’s without running with it.</p>
<p>Much has been made of the poor battery life, usually from people that haven’t used it, but Apple’s figures seem pretty spot on — 18 hours of use should not be an issue at all. If you do spend 18 hours wearing it you wont have an issue either, as it is one of the most comfortable watches I have. My initial reservations of the strange fastening of the sport band were forgotten after a few minutes.</p>
<p>One of the issues with Android Wear for me was the first party apps, or lack of. Being able to choose which app you use for actions is one of Android great strength, but I just wish they would build Google fit as easy to use as Apple’s Activity and Workout app. Relying on third party apps to integrate with Android Wear sometime left a bad taste in my mouth with inconsistent ability and ease of use.</p>
<p>With the Apple watch a couple of taps and I had started my run (which can be tailored to tap you on the wrist after a preselected distance or time) and each time I glanced at my watch, the time/distance or whatever I wanted was easy and clear — I ran a new PB too, but lets not give the watch too much credit! The watch also recorded my heart rate every 10 seconds during the run, which seems quite accurate to monitors I have worn before.</p>
<h2>Useful Clutter</h2>
<p>My only gripe so far has been the OS, if anything it does too much. However I can’t work out if that is subjective due to my extensive use of Android Wear or not. For the life of me I can’t image who is going to scroll through twitter feeds or order takeaway when you can pull out your phone — but hey if you’re one of those people — it does it.</p>
<p>That is not the focus though — if you are not going to use apps the watch work brilliantly as a notification handler. You can even remove apps from the phone if you are never going to use them. One thing I have used more than I thought I would is the activity and health app. I have written before about the danger of sitting too long, and the taps on my wrist is a nice reminder. It’s too early to know if that will continue or be switched of after a few days as an annoyance.<br />
Ok so this is far too long already, more incoming as the days go on.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>In 2011 we all gasped as Samsung released a phone that was almost universally labeled as never going to work. It was an experiment that only Samsung could get away with, just to see if it would sell in any great number. The phone was the 5.3 inch screen touting Galaxy Note –  a phone that was too big and would never catch on.</p><p>The Note was the creator of the ‘Phablet’ name, being more about mockery than labeling a new breed of smartphone. You can kind of see where they were coming from when the current biggest seller, Apple’s iPhone 4 and 4s featured a 3.5inch screen! Even Samsung’s own Galaxy S2 was considered huge with its 4.3 inch screen.</p><p>Now in 2015, when the industry standard seems to be anything around 5.5 inches, what exactly is a phablet now? What we once gasped at as a size is simply a normal sized phone now, the 4.3inches found on the Galaxy S2 is now compact. So if a phablet sized handset is now just a phone; what do we call everything below that?</p><p><em>Resolved: henceforth Phablets will just be called phones and phones with smaller screens will be called Fun Size. — Dieter Bohn</em></p><h2 id="fun-sized"><strong><strong><strong>Fun Sized?</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>I have hit a strange point in my phone-owning life, for the two years previous everyone around me had an iPhone, whilst I had a long, almost endless stream of Android phones sporting ever increasing screen sizes. I laughed and offered my magnifying glass to those still sporting 4 inch screens, but the fun didn’t last long.</p><p>I now sit with a Sony z3c compact in my hand, surrounded by 4.7inch touting iPhone users, or combinations of anything up to 6 inches for every other OS users. In a cruel twist of fate or playground law, all of the jokes I ever had for phones made for ants are now towards me. There is of cause one lesson from all this, fun sized is just fine for me (at least for phones).</p><p>Phones with 5 inches or less are considered Mini or Compact, but they are no longer sub par or compromises made in downscaled versions of their brothers. If you want something more pocketable, or have small hands you no longer have to lose out like you did with older generation handsets. They stand alone sporting specs, and price tags, that are equal – so they deserve a title, but what title?</p><h2 id="mini-budget"><strong><strong><strong>Mini = Budget</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>If the Mini brand reflects less specs and a downgrade, should the ‘compact’ name be an industry standard for flagship specs in a smaller body body? Although the Xperia Z3 compact takes a step down in screen resolution, it sports the rest of the internals of its bigger brother. Wins hearts, minds and attention in a world dominated by monster pocket computers. Yes I am a little biased, so a pinch of salt all around.</p><p>The downfall of this theory is the screen on the Xperia compact line has already jumped from 4.3 inches to 4.6inches. So it’s now only a smidgen smaller than the iPhone 6. Even the Moto X ditched its market-bucking small form factor to nestle in with the rest of the heard. So maybe compact doesn’t mean small as a rule – just a bit smaller than the really big one that used to be called a phablet but is now just a phone.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-phablet"><strong><strong><strong>What Is A Phablet?</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>We are not quite at the point of a complete split, but it’s coming. It may come sooner than we think if Apple keep pushing forward with bigger screens. That’s without Android’s continued march towards holding a TV to your ear. Manufacturers will only make what sells, and that seems to be an endless pursuit for more. The Motorola-made Nexus 6 now stretches the palm at 5.96 inches – where do we go next?</p><p>The recent HTC m9 leaks point towards adoption of a similar model to Apple: releasing a new handset alongside by a bigger (plus) version. Samsung  have been do this for three years, but releasing them at different times and with different names. The Galaxy S and Note lines are more cousins than brothers.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>If you spend upwards of 12 hours a day in a wheelchair, there is one thing you need to be with it, which is happy. Some need extra padding, some need a new paint job and a few accessories to make it theirs. However that just wasn’t enough for 16 year old Mohammad Sayed, he demanded more.</p><p>Already <a href="https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/discover">a student at NuVU in Cambridge</a>, Massachusetts, Mohammed was in the right place. Students at the ‘experimental high school’ reduce the traditional courses of English and math to complete several practice projects. Honing skills in more hands on subjects such as manufacturing, engineering and design. They have showcased projects producing alternative and more stable crutches and even a prosthetic hand that can write.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/4f388f3179.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="400" height="267" /></figure><p>So he set to work hacking and modifying his own wheelchair using his 3D printing and design skills to completely transform his chair. Along with a few classmates they built Mohammed everything he needed – adding on a Laptop tray and a canopy with accessible storage. However showing what is possible they redesigned the chair to be propelled by <a href="https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/studios/hacking-a-wheelchair/hand-drive#tab-final">a rowing motion rather than the normal pushing</a>.</p><h2 id="rowing-wheelchair"><strong><strong><strong>Rowing Wheelchair?</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>Now this may not be the first <a href="http://gogrit.org/lfc.html">person to try a rowing wheelchair</a>, but they are the first to make the whole process ‘cheap’ and easily available. The students claim that each part of the conversion only costs around $3 to make, all that’s needed is the metal bar to row yourself to your destination. That being said the 3D printer will set you back a fair few digits from your bank balance.</p><blockquote>“If you are someone with atrophy and the muscles you would use to push with your biceps are getting weaker, allowing for different types of movement could mean the difference between continuing in a manual wheelchair or being forced to convert to a power wheelchair,” – Mohammad Sayed</blockquote><p>The design is enabled with a racket system that will enable movement both backwards and forwards, although this came with several headaches. “none of us are mechanical engineers, so we went with the guess-and-check method.” added Kate Reed, 16. A true feat when considering the age and experience of some of the students.</p><h2 id="pushing-further"><strong><strong><strong>Pushing Further</strong></strong></strong></h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/82765aab4c.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="wheelchair 3dprinted diagrame" loading="lazy" /></figure><p>The really shows the ability of the students given extra attention in different areas. Mohammed added that this experimental high school had helped him not just with his practical work. Sayed was open with what the school has done for him. “Before NuVu, I didn’t do well in groups, because as a creative person you always push your own ideas, Communication was sometimes a challenge, but now I’ve learned.”Projects such as this really do push things that are becoming more possible with easily available design software and a 3D printer. All of the work is being open sourced, so you could take the designs and convert your own chair with the help of a 3D printing company.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>So it’s now 2015, the year of the hover board, self lacing shoes and holograms – according to Back to the Future at least. As technology continues its unrelenting march to improving, streamlining and hugely benefiting our lives, is it also time to admit we have no control over the abilities of new technology? Almost everything to we thought sacred, personal and indefinable, can be found or created by technology – including our fingerprints.</p><p>Jan Krissler took to the stage at Europe’s largest association of hackers to detail how easy it was to recreate a fingerprint. All from readily (and freely) available public photographs, he showed a proof of concept in a recreation of the digit marker contained on German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen thumb.</p><blockquote>“Biometrics that rely on static information like face recognition or fingerprints – it’s not trivial to forge them but most people have accepted that they are not a great form of security because they can be faked,” says cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University.</blockquote><h2 id="wear-gloves"><strong>Wear Gloves</strong></h2><p>31 year old Krissler, in some strange Guardians of the Galaxy spin-off, is referred to as Starbug by the fellow <a href="http://www.ccc.de/en/home">members of Chaos Computer Club</a> he was presenting to, all in the hope of showing that the fingerprint already used by the likes of Apple is insecure. However at this point it is important to note, no proof of the ability was shown. A simple demo could have been possible, but Starbug instead chose to clone a fingerprint of a pseudo celebrity.</p><p>Why he chose Ursula von der Leyen remains to be seen. Presumably this has something to do with needing a clear picture of her thumb print and also others from different angles. So with this in mind claims made that “politicians will presumably wear gloves when talking in public after hearing about his research” seems a little far fetched.</p><h2 id="vein-patterns"><strong>Vein Patterns</strong></h2><p>There are worries however, as Apple, HTC, and Samsung all have implemented security around your digits – all of which can be fooled by anything from latex gloves to PVA glue. Not to mention its continued use in high security buildings, laptops and computer systems.</p><p>Fingerprint scanning is also set to be adopted in a <a href="http://techaeris.com/2014/10/18/contactless-biometric-payments-step-closer/">new wave of smart bank cards we reported on back in October. </a> However the next step may be finger vein recognition, a system of “pattern-recognition techniques <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein">based on images of human finger vein patterns</a> beneath the skin’s surface.”</p><p>This works either as a two step authentication or separate from the fingerprint, and is something already under heavy testing and in<a href="http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2363639/barclays-and-hitachi-unveil-biometric-security-vein-scanner">use by Barclays business customers</a>, as well as at cash machines in Poland and Japan. This only works with a fully functioning finger and isn’t affected by blood flow or pressure: removing the prospect of a criminal removing your digits!</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Right from the outset it’s obvious that this is a <em><em>Black Mirror</em></em> Christmas special filled with roast turkey, tinsel and snow aplenty. Also obvious from the very first scene is that the opening frames are building to a very different kind of Christmas special. Taking a delve into the not too distant, but very real technology influenced, dark and decrepit modern society.</p><p>Smile, it’s Christmas! The time for drinks, family time and peace on Earth to all men. Well maybe not all men, as the two main protagonists (played by Jon Hamm and and Rafe Spall) are clearly escaping or sentenced to escape away from the life they once had. From here, Charlie Brooker takes his usual stab at everything from Google Glass, to social media and even modern slavery and torture.</p><p>I told you this was dark, but all wrapped up in the way Brooker seems to cloud everything – just enough so the story seems to work on more than one level. The feature length special wraps three stories around each other, beginning at funny, and carrying right through to downright freaky. The story telling, writing and cinematography makes no changes from the two other short series we have seen before. If you haven’t already, then go a watch now as from here on in there be spoilers!</p><h2 id="romance-coaching"><strong>Romance Coaching</strong></h2><p>With wit, humor, and just a few white lies, Matt (Jon Hamm) begins to tell the story of of how he ended up in the place he is now. It’s narrated with all the silky smooth demeanor that his stereotypical American appearance conveys. Using his skills to coach what he describes as ‘dorks’, in this case Harry (Rasmus Hardiker), all while observing through “Eye­Link” all in the name of sex.</p><p>Providing jokes, motivation and a little stage fright in order to end the night in bed, they believe they have ‘hit the jackpot’ but the winning lady in this case, mistakes Harry talking to Matt as mental illness. When Harry aims to motivate her to do what the voices tell her by changing jobs she mistakes this for a suicide pact. So instead of spending the night between the sheets, they spend it dying on top of it, all whilst being observed by his ‘coach’ and anyone that has brought the footage. None are unwilling to get involved when the worst happens, raising questions to our current wearable technology, mental health issues and willingness to walk away rather than help someone in need.</p><p>When Matt’s wife is understandably unhappy when she discovers his involvement, we first see the best piece of social media critique ever as she blocks him.</p><h2 id="blocked-out"><strong>Blocked Out</strong></h2><p>Booker has taken the simple block option on social media and pushes this to what could be a logical extension. The person blocked simply becomes a greyed out vistal entity. The block solves nothing, conversation cannot conclude and nothing is resolved, yet the world moves on. Moving on is inevitable, as Matt’s day job raises all sorts of questions on what constitutes a human.</p><p>Matt’s day job is automating the homes of those rich enough to pay for the service, in this case Greta (Oona Chaplin), by implanting a small chip (cookie) into a persons brain to absorb ‘themselves’. They then record everything that makes up their personality and everything they like into lines of code, making smart and snide remarks to almost tease the ‘copy’ of a person. Once removed, this ‘person’ is put to work in automating everything in the house.</p><h2 id="forced-emotion-and-rushed-story"><strong>Forced Emotion and Rushed Story</strong></h2><p>Empathy for those imprisoned in the cookie is built fast with very real human reactions eradicated in a short period of time. The general tone and reactions from the story felt very forced and rushed. A human is not just their physical self, that goes without saying, but questions to Matt about the barbarity of his actions are forced aside quickly as if rushed. When Matt describes his technique of breaking ‘them’ in without snapping completely it felt as though this story could have should have been covered in an hour long episode alone. Just by using the word ’empathetic,’ Matt both insults and compliments.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/529221a3fb.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" /></figure><p>That’s all before we even move onto poor Joe (Rafe Spall) and his tale of woe. Casting bright colours against a plain white dusting of snow, Joes story starts with actions and sounds of love and joy. With an appearance from the same song when everything goes wrong in the second episode of <em><em>Black Mirror – </em></em>an offbeat rendition of Irma Thomas’ “Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand).”</p><h2 id="old-faces-and-ideas"><strong>Old Faces And Ideas</strong></h2><p>This throw back also marks the point where everything will seem very familiar if you have watched previous episodes. After Joe is blocked by his pregnant girlfriend, it descends into a mixtures of old episodes and characters. You see images of dancers on Hot Shots and even the comedy show that spawned Waldo.</p><p>After spending years being blocked and not being able to see his daughter, it is eventually rescinded when she dies in a rail crash, so Joe is finally able to set eyes on his daughter for the first time. From here on out its twists and turns that are not to be missed so I won’t spoil them here. The one-off episode is available on 4OD and also should be available on DirectTV in the US from the 21st onward. Merry Christmas!</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2014/12/13/lg-g-watch.html"><h1 class="p-name">LG G Watch R Review: Stylish But Falls Short</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Round is cool. That’s just a fact – wheels, money, Oreos… they’re all brilliant. We’ve only seen two attempts at round Android Wear watches, and just one if you count the flat tyre of the Moto 360. Why there isn’t more, only manufacturers know. Most have adopted the safe haven of a square. So here we are, left with the <a href="http://amzn.to/1GmJPB6">LG G Watch R</a>.</p>
<p>You can stop thinking that this is a round version of the original LG G watch right now. Thats a very wrong assumption to make, as much like the <a href="http://techaeris.com/2014/12/04/sony-smartwatch-3-review-the-best-android-wear-watch-at-the-moment/">Sony Smartwatch 3 I tested last week</a>, it has received spec bumps and improvements in all the areas that you need. The <a href="http://amzn.to/1GmJPB6">G Watch R</a> (GWR) is competing with the specs of the Sony watch, in what many consider hardware version 2 on Android Wear.</p>
<p>Unlike the original G Watch, design has been very much on the minds of LG when working on the GWR. Instead of the plain Nexus like design, we get something that looks a top of the range sports watch, all be it a sports watch from the 1990’s, and those design cues are straight from G shock.</p>
<h2 id="design-choices"><strong><strong><strong>Design Choices</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<p>Its almost annoying that the numbered dial around the outside doesn’t turn, so I can relive some youthful games of marking how much oxygen I had left. This does mean that, along with the Moto 360, it can actually be mistaken for a normal watch – something distinctly lacking from LG’s first model. Being more at home with a suit in the office with the Moto 360, than out running with the Sony Smartwatch 3.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e3a6043354.jpg" alt="" width="819" height="410" /></figure>
<p>The large bezel around the outside replaces the flat tyre look of the Motor 60, its actually a full circle! This does add a little bulk, and slightly inhibits you a bit when swiping cards away. Being a large margin above the 1.3-inch P-OLED display, the design makes the usual palm over the device a little more difficult. The display is noticeably smaller than the Sony Smartwatch 4, maintaining 320×320 dimensions, but colors are much more vibrant.</p>
<h2 id="strap-life"><strong><strong><strong>Strap Life</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<p>Coming with a leather strap its hard to know where LG want to sit the styling of the watch. You would expect a watch taking all its design cues from sports watches to come with a high grade rubber strap like most of the competition. However the bundled leather strap is a confusing mix of sports and fashion, and with the leather wearing within a few days around the fastening and strap end its clearly not high grade leather.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9209c87239.jpg" alt="" width="819" height="410" /></figure>
<p>That’s not all bad news as this leather wearing in does mean that after a few days use the strap is amazingly comfortable. Luckily the watch uses a standard 22mm watch strap so changing them for something new is easy. The only question that should be asked though is why should you have to? With the low grade leather its hard to see how they can justify the £220 price tag, given the Moto 360 come in at £199. It will be a tough choice to justify the extra outlay when comparing them side by side.</p>
<h2 id="harder-to-kill"><strong><strong><strong>Harder to Kill</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<p>Given the choice on paper, many will chose the Moto 360. During use, the battery life increase on the GWR alone is worth a little extra outlay. The 410 mah battery consistently gets me through 2 days with moderate use – even the odd day of heavy use still saw me through to the next morning.</p>
<p>Battery life on Android wear is a tough choice, the battery life needs to last through a tough day of heavy use, but does it really need to last more than that? We are a long way off anything last as long as the pebble, but I am fast coming to the conclusion that if the battery lasts more than a day, then it needs to last two – otherwise manufactures are just adding weight to spec sheets, for no real reason to the end user.</p>
<h2 id="harder-to-like"><strong><strong><strong>Harder to like</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<p>There are certain products that just don’t have that special something, and that last little bit is missing from the G Watch. It doesnt feel like a step forward, despite the improved display and battery, it just feels like a round version on the first generation hardware – all be it with much better looks and a much better battery.</p>
<p>The battery charger, although easy to use, is a proprietary piece of hardware I have to worry about. So anytime I spend traveling I have to make sure I know where this small bit of plastic is. Though I am sure this won’t suffer the same fate as my Gear Live charger, more manufacturers need to offer at least a back up of the basic micro USB connection.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2f2434d94f.jpg" alt="" width="819" height="410" /></figure>
<p>It does however feature a heartrate sensor, that seems to be much more accurate than others on the market. Unlike the Gear Live I can use it after a run and whilst damp. Despite the graphing ability in Google Fit, we are still lacking the ability to record it at intervals through out the day.</p>
<p>The lack of an ambient light sensor was also a big draw back after using the SW3 and Moto 360 as it means the screen is either on or off, which is constantly annoying. Luckily the 5.0 update to Android Wear has fixed this little issue (but more about that another time). The recent update however, has yet to fix all the small announces with the screen.</p>
<p>When the screen dims after covering of after a period of inactivity, the screen fades all the way to black, only to brighten back up to the dim screen. If the screen then turns on the face will jump slightly, very noticeable due to the high contrast colour on the screen. Again a small annoyance, but ruining the experience of the most expensive Android watch on the market ever so slightly.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong><strong><strong>Conclusion</strong></strong></strong></h2>
<p>If styling is the most important factor to you and you want a full circle Android Wear smartwatch, there is only one watch to choose from. For a good looking Android Wear watch without the battery anxiety of the Moto 360, choose the G Watch R. But for all the round ability on the G Watch R, it falls short of living up to Android Wear hardware v2. Given the expensive outlay be sure the styling is for you, as it will soon be outdated with new hardware incoming.</p>

      <p>To be social – “needing companionship and therefore best suited to living in communities or an informal social gathering, especially one organized by the members of a particular club or group”. In the modern age this no longer needs to be done in person, it can all be done without leaving your house. Facebook messenger, Google Hangouts and Skype mean you can interact with people much easier all over the world.</p><p>According to Ofcom, the use of social networks in several countries has actually felt a decline in 2014. Measuring web traffic to social networks compared to other websites, the UK regulator found some unsuspected results. Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are seeing less weekly visits from users in major countries around the world.</p><h2 id="social-visits"><strong>Social Visits</strong></h2><p>The largest decline in weekly access to social networks coming from users in the UK – dropping from 65% to 56%. Declining use also in the US (from 56% to 54%), Japan (45% to 42%), and China (62% to 57%). Many countries also had increased number of visits, however, such as France, Italy, Australia and Spain.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/8254be2649.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="848" height="416" /></figure><p>These figure will have no cause for alarm for those running these social networks, as many have actually recorded increased usage and interaction over the last year. With 1.35 billion monthly active users on Facebook (Facebook 28/10/14), and 284 million active users on<a href="https://about.twitter.com/company"> Twitter sending 500million tweets </a>every day!</p><p>Increased usage of less “traditional social networks” has been highlighted as a catalyst to these figures. Users are still visiting social sites in the billions, but increase usage of online videos and messaging services are “cannibalizing social network usage” according to Ofcom. Users don’t need to visit a website to interact with their friends any longer, WhatsApp and other messaging services offer quicker and easier solutions.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/8c79928f56.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="847" height="452" /></figure><h2 id="mobile-rules-them-all"><strong>Mobile Rules Them All</strong></h2><p>There is one winner from all of the Ofcom reports and figures, and that’s mobile usage. Social networking is the largest online use of your pocket computer. We have reported <a href="http://techaeris.com/2014/09/06/shopping-online-mobile-leads-way/">the rise of mobile browsing at several points</a> this year. Even the rise of online shopping is nowhere near as popular as those social apps, tipping other activities such as reading the news, shopping and playing games in all but China and Japan.</p>

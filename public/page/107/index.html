<p>Don’t worry. Nothing PG here. Merely the fact that at any hardware launch it’s important to really appreciate the lengths Apple go to to make the phone feel the best it can. Even while picking the phone up in the Apple store I am steered towards the cases that are marketed in a colourful display near the back of the shop. Clearly cases have become a necessity – but I’ve spent at the least the first few hours with the phone ’naked’.</p>
<p>Since the iPhone 6, all of the hardware has looked it’s best nestled in a case. That’s not to say that it isn’t nice workmanship, but the camera bump has signalled the need for some neutrality. A case equals out the depth of the phone and means everything sits flush once again. Cupertino <a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2014/9/16/6209759/apple-has-an-embarassing-bulge">are no longer hiding the appendix</a>, and in actual fact leaning in quite a bit. However the fact is it feels better in a case, I really wish they would thicken the device inline with the bump and add in some extra battery – but Apple like to design small packages.</p>
<p><a href="http://darylbaxter.com/">Darryl Baxter</a> pitched this idea to me when he got his iPhone 8 Plus, so this time I’ve made a conscious effort to really appreciate the design effort gone into producing the device. Using it case less is a revelation, appreciating how much smaller and lighter the phone is, using it as Apple intended. Apple design <a title="Apple Design Excellence Is Failing" href="/post/2017-10-06-apple-design-failing/">may not be leading the pack as it once</a> was, but they sure know how to pack loads of tech into a slim device.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have the Space Grey version that <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/926392604501176320">shows finger prints</a> like you’ve been eating KFC. Not to mention the extremely high prices for damaging your shiny new handset. Apple repair prices for the front glass is £279 and replacing the back glass complete with wireless charging coil is more than £500! So even at £200 Apple care + might be a worthwhile investment if you plan on living naked.</p>
<p>So my new iPhone X is tucked away in its leather case and no doubt will stay there – but it was a nice experiment.</p>

<p>The once relied upon tech journalists that influenced purchasing decisions are up in arms that Apple let some lesser known people be the first to release their videos.</p>
<p>Videos by channels such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPYe5343jdQ">Booredatwork.com</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r51fE02IVRE">UrAvgConsumer</a> and even streetwear channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQphKeR-fCo">HighSnobiety</a> have made traditional tech reviews act like entitled rich kids. Quite a few You-tubers were invited to what appears to be Apple stores and allowed to release their videos a day or so before everyone else. This is a huge achievement and great recognition of a changing media landscape. Yet those having to wait until later in the week to publish theirs have a huge issue with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031040332/https://www.recode.net/2017/10/30/16577146/iphone-x-launch-teaser-video">Recode described the videos as</a> “a little braggy”, and criticised them for the fact they “don’t feel like gadget reviews at all”. Indeed these are not reviews you are looking at, they are hands on videos. Made during a few minutes with the devices (around 45). Most of those complaining have already had the luxury of attending Apple campus and sitting though the keynote as well as handling the phone already. Not to mention the luxury of more than a week using the iPhone X – but are they too blinkered to see these things.</p>
<p>Videos such as these won’t replace reviews from large publications like Arstechnica and The Verge, but supplement and add to them from a completely different angle. Subscribers to these channels are seeking real opinions on questions they have about the device. They don’t care about flashy effects and top notch editing, they want real opinions and lots of them.</p>
<p>An honest opinion that isn’t pressured by the fact that Apple gave them a device FOC. Or that a certain amount of clicks need to be achieved to balance the books. The vast majority of us had to spend a lot of cash to buy one, and will still review the device because we enjoy doing it.</p>
<p>The time has come to face the fact that “YouTube channels you’ve never heard of” have a much more relevant opinion than many tech publications. <a href="https://twitter.com/superscientific/status/925210521049223168">Most</a> are not wrapped up in their own bubble of self importance they miss what is in front of them. They tell the tale of what it is like to use the device, if only for a few minutes, and don’t get bogged down in this CPU and that Screen.</p>
<p>With that said this isn’t the time to start being snarky back. The claims that you are the “future of the media” can wait for another time. Those that got hands on should be proud of their recognition and feel humble. Keep doing what you are doing but most of all – enjoy it.</p>

<p>Since pretty much the dawn of time we have been looking for ways to make sure we are different from each other. Understandable when you’re competing for limited terrain or food sources, yet we still do it whilst wrapped up in an easy existence.</p>
<p>What once was tribal warfare, evolved into splitting ourselves based on arbitrary drawn country borders, and now the lines are draw over some of the most stupid reasons you could imagine. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/21/5307992/inside-the-mind-of-a-fanboy">So called ‘Fanboys’</a> are nothing new – Mac Vs PC, Xbox vs Playstation, Nintendo vs Sega, the list goes on and on. Yet the venom and vitriol spat by some people because they use a specific mobile phone is just stupid.</p>
<p>It only takes one issue to pop up on either side of the iOS / Android fence and it brings the worst out in people. Matt Bircher’s <a href="http://pca.st/episode/3f9cafcd-301a-4653-bd94-ba40da8777d3">“Birchtree” podcast</a> started this off with his talk about Android hating tweets in his time line, and I had an interesting debate with Paul on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqB56pzcYVo">Snappytech podcast</a>. I try really hard to not be biased towards one system or another, and understandably it is hard to not get carried away – I just wish others put in the same effort.</p>
<p>People are so <a href="http://m.androidcentral.com/airpods-android-seriously">emotionally involved in protecting their mobile phone operating system</a> it borders on bazaar. Yet the weird thing is I kind of get it, the need to belong to a group. The feeling that others share your common interests and beliefs is one of the most powerful things a human can experience. How exactly do you think extremist groups get people do weird and crazy things for weird and crazy reasons?</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m a missionary,” says Thorne. “For me, it’s about being super passionate and super knowledgeable about their products, and not leaving that passion at the door when you leave work. You preach it all the time.” – Thorne, Microsoft Fanboy</p></blockquote>
<p>Hey, one of the most important things to me is my family #TeamMorris. For exactly those reasons, these are people that will love and protect me whatever the circumstance.</p>
<p>With that said, why are we intent on seperating ourselves out. Just because I am born here, doesn’t make me any different than someone born the other side of the world. We are all exactly the same except for the lives we have led up to that point. It makes zero difference based on skin colour, language we speak or where we live so why exactly is my opinion rubbish because I use one phone and you use a different one?</p>
<p>There is no pretending I use Apple products – almost all of them. However I have made a choice to do this because they fit in the best for me. The rate of Android and Apple fans that are over the top biased towards one thing or another is troubling. As Matt said in his podcast if you’re just a voice for one brand or another it simply makes you a much less interesting person to follow – so maybe that’s exactly what people will start doing.</p>

<p>For the last few days my Twitter feed has been awash with comments about the new Google Pixel XL 2 (or the Pixel 2 XL, I forget!). All of a sudden Android writers have split into two camps. Those that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/24/16519530/google-pixel-2xl-screen-issues-deep-and-unfixable">criticised the poor quality screen</a>, and those that <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/relax-about-pixel-2-xl-display">lept to its defence</a>. The truth is usually somewhere in the middle, but this screen debacle is only the tip of a very worrying trend creeping into manufactures.</p>
<p>Almost the whole industry seem to have adopted Facebook’s mantra of <a href="https://xkcd.com/1428/">”move fast and break things”</a>. Quality has taken a back seat to producing a product at least once a year, shipping it almost to the day of the last version. Google appear to have pushed out a phone with sub par parts, when in reality what they should have done is hold on a little longer and produce a quality handset. Unfortunately though this rush is not just portrayed by Google</p>
<p>Even the once highly held ‘Apple quality’ badge is starting to slip. FaceID and the notch seen in the iPhone X have a more than passing feel of a rushed production cycle. Many Apple users have been very vocal about the need for the company to really deliver a great new design this year – and we are <a href="/post/2017-10-06-apple-design-failing/">left with compromises</a>. The main worry is that these oversights will also be present in production quality, because Cupertino is also dropping the ball with its code.</p>
<p>Apples software has been on a downward trend for a while, suffering what appears to be the rathe of impatience even more. iOS11 has been <a href="http://www.techradar.com/how-to/ios-11-problems-how-to-fix-them">highly criticised as the most buggy</a> release ever, and <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/macos-high-sierra-latest-version-problems-fixes-features-compatibility-3647580/">High Sierra is not far behind</a>! Luckily these kinds of issues can be fixed and pushed out reasonably easily. However using sub par components tends to get found out pretty quickly – <a href="http://bgr.com/2017/07/07/oneplus-5-scrolling-issue-baffling-explanation/">just ask OnePlus</a>.</p>
<p>Is there a real need to throw out a new handset every year? The iterations from iPhone 6s to 8 haven’t brought any massive leaps, so the argument could be made that this is a self imposing cycle. The desire for Apple to produce more and more growth, and take in more and more revenue is only going to end one way. Either the cycle breaks, or the products do.</p>
<p>Now is the time for OEMS to take longer to produce hardware that is worth the upgrade. Handset prices have pushed upwards in the last couple of years with no meaningful reason to spend so much money. If build quality is the same at £300 and £900 then strong questions need to be asked.</p>

<p>Just incase you hadn’t gathered already, I really like Apple products. Not because I am some obsessive fan boy, but because (generally speaking) they all work together and achieve exactly what I want from my devices. Given this meek attachment I never feel the need to jump to Cupertino defence when they release products I don’t like, or do things that I think could be better. This is why <a href="http://byodpodcast.com/">the podcast</a> walks that line, and in actual fact I recent post on the <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2352/apple-is-really-bad-at-design">Outline that is very anti-Apple</a> makes many points I agree with. Apple design excellence that once existed is being eroded away and that’s a very bad position to be in.</p>
<p>Their own design choices of wiggly lines aside, I am always a little sceptical about these posts written to stir an emotional response. Do they really believe what they are writing or are all of these words written just for clicks. However Josh raises some very valid points (<a href="https://twitter.com/joshuatopolsky/status/879512768206053376?lang=en">something he didn’t with tweets surrounding the iPad Pro</a>) about the design and user experience of Apple products and I have to agree they are declining in quality.</p>
<p>I can forgive the Apple Pencil stuck in the Lightning port, I can also semi forgive a <a href="https://www.geek.com/apple/design-before-function-apple-magic-mouse-2-cant-be-used-while-charging-1636939/">mouse with a charging point on the bottom</a>, but when software and design choices actually make the device harder to use then questions should be asked. Issues with bugs in iOS11 are rife, the OS now contains a sudo lock screen that used to be a notification hub , and Control Centre has been turned into a grid of semi blobs with toggles in and it only looks to be getting worse with the iPhone X.</p>
<p>Removing a home button may allow Apple to squeeze in a large screen, but their are so many navigation items to include, users need to relearn everything they know about the iPhone. The developer of Overcast Marco Arment has a large job on his hands updating the app to work with the iPhone X. Changing the UI to work on gestures rather than buttons is all very well, but at the cost of hours of development time there are defiantly huge trade offs.</p>
<p>You could argue that this is too be expected when Apple change design, and it was a particularly painful experience for those that adopted the iPhone 6 plus early on. Unfortunately there is no argument against having to redesign the apps because Apple left a notch in the screen and didn’t design the UI around it.</p>
<blockquote><p>”Design isn’t just about beauty, its about market relevance and meaningful results” – John Maeda, former president of the Rhode Island School Of Design</p></blockquote>
<p>You can talk about <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/907764896829452288">website design and CSS safe zones</a> all you like, but the truth is these design trade offs in hardware and software are a modern Apple issue. We can sit around and muse over what Steve Jobs would of allowed the phone to look like, but I have a gut feeling he wouldn’t have liked it.</p>
<p>Design is not just what the device looks like, it is how intuitive and easy the device is to use. Design is not just an object, it is a sum of all the parts involved in any use, users are affected by the design choices made when designing the phone. If this is a confusing experience, with a notch cut out the screen that you are paying £1000 for then it doesn’t look good. Final judgement will come when the device finally goes on sale, but with more <a href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/09/28/iphone-x-reachability-support/">actions to fit into the UI</a> before sale Apple’s design dominance is really taking a battering.</p>

<p>My health and well being has always been a huge focus for me. I have been an avid runner, professional footballer and sport scientist but being active and healthy is increasingly hard in the modern world. The one thing that has helped me move more and weigh less is the Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Not to mention that when you have health complications and your doctor asks how active you are, it has proved invaluable to just pull out my phone and point to the screen. I honestly couldn’t see a life without this stupid thing strapped to my wrist, and would love others to embrace it.</p>
<p>The marketing spin was in full effect when Tim Cook referred to the newly released Apple Watch as “<a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2014/09/09Apple-Unveils-Apple-Watch-Apples-Most-Personal-Device-Ever/">The most personal device ever</a>”. All those hearing these worlds collectively rolled their eyes and waited for what it really does for you. The tech specs and the abilities are the main focus, however the personal angle has been far more important to me. This piece of equipment touches my skin for the majority of the day, and far outweighs the pokes and prods that my iPhone gets.</p>
<p>The truth is that I spend far more time interacting with a watch than I ever thought possible. The ever present three coloured rings have pushed me to move more, stand more and make me more in touch with my body.</p>
<p>After a long day, many of us would flop down into a chair and that would be the end of movement for the day. However more often than not, this is the time I stare at my watch and see I have been stationary for far longer than I think. Therese are the moments I fight with myself but ultimatly get my ass moving for 30 mins or more.</p>
<p>I’m always dubious about these things, and wonder if I have just been duped into a ploy to ‘gameify’ exercise. However I look down at myself and see the changes that have improved my life massively and I just don’t care. If filling a red ring everyday leads to me being much healthier, then so be it. Im a slave to those stupid rings, and I love it! Just please let me listen to <a href="/post/2017-09-23-podcast-watchos/">Podcasts Apple</a>!</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>There has been lots and lots of noise following the iPhone event on Tuesday, Which is one of the reasons I have left this post for a few days. As normal falling into two camps of opinion, which is always to be expected, however the prevailing narrative is that the iPhone x is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16291244/new-iphone-x-photos-video-hands-on">the future of smartphones</a> in a product made now – unfortunately this simply is not true.</p>
<p>The truth is that once phones like Samsung’s <a href="http://www.coolsmartphone.com/2017/06/30/a-mobile-love-story-comparing-the-galaxy-s8-and-the-lg-g6/">Galaxy S8, the LG G6</a> and various others from <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/09/mi-mix-2-designer-philippe-starck-talks-phone-design-bezels.html">Chinese OEMs</a> started hitting the market the traditional iPhone design became old. It was certainly iconic, but rooted in design and technical capability of a decade ago.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/63051934c9.jpg" alt="IPhoneX mockup png 1" title="iPhoneX-mockup.png-1.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="283" />Smartphone manufacturers are already producing handset of equal design and production quality equal to the iPhone X. The bitter pill to swallow is that Cupertino until now had been relying on legacy install base for sales results. The materials used and the manufacturing process may be a large step forward, but the design of the iPhone X shows that Apple is just catching up to the already high bar.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Apple have crammed in a huge amount of technology and achieved a screen to body ration that is <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/iphone%5C_x%5C_screen%5C_to%5C_body%5C_ratio%5C_compared-news-27264.php">leading the pack</a> – but does this really matter to users? FaceID although very impressive, feels a little too much like a compromise. Questions still exist if Apple believe this is the way we authenticate for years to come, or if it was developed simply because they couldn’t get TouchID to work under the screen.</p>
<p>Samsung beat Apple to a full screen handset and are set to have another crack at it in a few months time. Leaving Apple to inevitably play catch up once again. iPhone X is not tomorrow design today, it is todays design but a few months late.</p>

<p>As the saying goes, “Everything leaks”. Even as <a title="Tim Cook: Apple will &#039;double down on secrecy on products&#039; - The Verge" href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwievNWTpprWAhWFKMAKHZEYA5sQFggvMAE&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/29/3051521/tim-cook-apple-will-double-down-on-secrecy-on-products&amp;usg=AFQjCNF68aw2iuTrGn8uqoeQMSUQEo2MWA">Apple attempts to double down</a> on their security surrounding information leaking, readers of technology websites have been bombarded with information on the new handset. This started even before the iPhone 7 launched, but only a few days before the press event, the iOS11 build for the new phone found its way out, and apparently website shouldn’t be covering it.</p>
<p>For the last few weeks I have definitely <a title="Episode 19: You’ve triggered Cortana!" href="https://www.byodpodcast.com/episodes/episode-19-youve-triggered-cortana/9/9/2017">been experiencing leak fatigue</a> and admittedly the rate of leaks does spoil the event somewhat. However part of the magic is Apple executives filling in the gaps on stage. Walking through new features that are only on the new phone, and telling you how those features are going to fit into your life.</p>
<p>So leaking every last little bit of software <em>is</em> going to somewhat dampen the mood but that is just the tech circles we live in. Joe public will not care that some nerds found some code a few days before Apple talked about the phone. It wont stop hundreds of thousands of people watching the live stream, and it won’t dampen sales.</p>
<p>What you are really mad at is someone told you what you’re getting for Christmas. The outcry against publications <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/09/08/ios-11-gm-d22-iphone-8-details/">like 9to5mac</a> thats have “ruined Apple workers hard work” a few days before the event is laughable. Getting mad at a publication for doing so is like getting mad at rain clouds because you want to have a garden party.</p>
<p>Lets not forget most of the information was leaked a long time before that, bundled inside the <a title="HomePod firmware provides detailed look at iPhone 8 screen layout ..." href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqxrreqJrWAhUlIcAKHRkGDS0QFggoMAA&amp;url=http://9to5mac.com/2017/08/10/homepod-firmware-provides-detailed-look-at-iphone-8-screen-layout-resizable-home-button-more/&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBZir9huo8GA5NTItlZwZrEXzQtw">HomePod firmware</a>. Yet everyone was ok with that, it showed us almost everything about the phone bar a few details. Yet not so when this new leak rolls around, unveiling some interesting titbits but nothing revolutionary – it’s not as if they were going to put a <a title="Putting back the iPhone 7 headphone jack" href="http://www.gr36.com/iphone-7-headphone-jack/">headphone jack back in the phone</a>!</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a time limit on leaks, everything is fair game except for the last week before the event? <em>OR</em> maybe its time to just accept that things leak, the new iPhone is no different to Game Of Thrones episodes. Spoil or do not spoil, the outlook is up to you.</p>

  </div>
<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Sure enough, just after deciding that my workflow of using <a href="http://www.gr36.com/bear-and-ulysses/">Bear and Ulysses</a> to write all of my content was pretty much perfect – I’ve changed again. For the past week I have been exploring using Apple Notes instead of Bear now that iOS11 is about to drop, and it seems to be working very well.</p>
<p>The Stock Notes app on iOS has rightly got a lot of stick over the years. There are some people <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/ipad-diaries-optimizing-apple-notes/">that wouldn’t use anything else</a>, but many more users simply require a much more powerful app. <a href="http://www.gr36.com/bear-the-serious-notes-app/">Bear has filled that gap</a> for me since launch, making writing in markdown a beautiful experience and dead simple. However it always felt a little redundant paying for two subscriptions when they both do a very similar job. After learning how to improve lots of areas of my organisation through the <a href="http://www.gr36.com/learn-ulysses-writing-app/">Learn Ulysses course</a> this was even more the case, so I wanted a replacement.</p>
<h2><strong>Apple Notes in iOS11</strong></h2>
<p>With iOS11 Apple have improved Notes in many ways to make it more user friendly. Filing has become much more simple, drag and drop works flawlessly and the overall speed and app experience is much smoother. These improvements make it much easier to jot down quick ideas, saves links to look at later and even do some drafting if your heat desires.</p>
<p>What’s more I can use Siri to dictate a note I quickly think of, and unfortunately <a href="http://www.gr36.com/siri-falls-down-default-apps/">Siri cant do that</a> for every app at the moment. There is also the option to make hand written notes or annotations in line with text, add in images and lots of things you couldn’t do very well or the implementation was a bit clunky. One thing particularly useful is the ability to quickly launch the Notes app with an Apple Pencil double tap on the lock screen.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bb02dad611.jpg" alt="Image 05 09 2017 12 11 1" title="Image-05-09-2017-12-11-1.png" border="0" width="599" height="425" /></p>
<h2><strong>Downsides</strong></h2>
<p>I still miss a few things that can be found in more powerful apps. Tagging being the main one, as there is no way to organise notes other than in chronological order from last edited or Alphabetical. Folders are possible, however going backwards and forwards between them is not an easy task on iOS. This is partly made up for by a very fast and reliable search function, which even understands your handwriting if you’ve made some notes with the Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>The worst thing for publishing is Apple Notes app insisting on using a weird version of Rich text so converting to markdown is a pain. I created an <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/b75d1fc9f97e476d8a3e3765321184ea">Apple Notes to markdown Workflow</a> which automates the switch to Markdown, which is infinitely more friendly to work with for publishing. This Workflow also copies the resulting Markdown to a new sheet in my ‘ideas’ folder of Ulysses. I can then continue to draft this until I’m happy, add images and publish.</p>
<p>There is no X-Callback URL support in Notes what so ever, and the sharing of notes to other apps can sometimes go a little wonky depending on the app. However all in all the improvements made to app have made it a serious contender to be put back on many users main screen.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1bc9449bf0.jpg" alt="Apple notes iphone7 1" title="apple-notes-iphone7-1.png" border="0" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>I would like to see more user features in upcoming versions of Notes, perhaps the ability to change the font to something more readable. Proper Rich Text would be much easier to use than the current implementation, but I’d really love basic text or markdown support – although I don’s see that ever happening. However I would edge you to give notes another chance and see if the improvements make your life easier.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Does there have to be a reason to buy a bigger phone other than just a bigger screen? The Plus model of the iPhone has already proved a runaway success with users, but with the iPhone 7 Apple chose to give it something extra – another camera.</p>
<p>The big brother touted two camera lenses to aid zooming in on your subject, and also record depth information used to make any portrait subject really stand out with a bokeh effect. They made a huge deal about this feature when annoying the phone, and also in adverts, but it is hard form me to see the value without sacrificing stretching your palm and your trouser pockets.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=hcMSrKi8hZA">https://youtube.com/watch?v=hcMSrKi8hZA</a></p>
<p>The truth is as good as the portrait mode may be, the amount of times I have missed the other camera is next to none. Perhaps I am just able to get a bit closer to what I am taking a photo of. Maybe I simply don’t take the types of photos others do, but I wouldn’t give up a phone that fits in my pocket for a better zoom. What I really don’t need is yet another camera mode!</p>
<p>Having to worry about what setting to select to best capture the scene in front of me negates the whole point of having an easy to use camera. A camera app should be intelligent enough to know I am taking a portrait without having to access a specific setting. Applying the necessary blurring and bokeh as required and making it customisable to your preference.</p>
<p>Sure enough Apple is half way there, in portrait mode the camera app saves a copy of the photo without any depth effect. So why on earth can’t this happen in reverse like HDR photos? Hopefully Cupertino engineers have managed to stuff enough lenses and computing power into the new iPhone to make this camera more intelligent. However the delay in figuring out something that has been the staple of Sony cameras for a number of years is a little worrying.</p>
<p>Until then a simple, easy to use, single lens suits me fine, I don’t miss a dual camera at all.</p>

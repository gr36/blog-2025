  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>This year was the second year I set myself a goal. One that was born out of a frustration that my attention being stolen from me and my concern that I needed to get it back. 2022 my goal was to watch more movies. Like most New Year’s resolutions, it failed miserably in the first few weeks. Whereas reading, that’s my thing!</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/88c6fd84a3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="making-goals">Making Goals</h2>
<p>Setting a goal always seems a bit strange to me. I followed in the footsteps of Matt Birchler for movies, and was encouraged by micro.blog to set one for reading. The trouble was I had no idea what to set it at. I <em>had</em> been using the excellent <a href="https://epilogue.micro.blog/">Epilogue app</a> for a while, but not long enough to track a whole year.</p>
<p>I honestly had no idea how many books I <em>could</em> read in a year, and even setting a goal based on books read seemed strange. Some books are easy to polish off in a day or so, whereas some I have read required a long slog of considerable effort. I thought about hours of reading, but that seemed like a chore. I could think about <a href="https://tiramisu.bearblog.dev/2023-books/">counting pages turned,</a> I guess, but that’s more work than I want to put in. So books read is a happy medium.</p>
<p>I settled on 30. It was a bit finger in the air, sitting a long way below the extreme levels I have seen online, and also felt achievable. 30 books was a little over 2 a month and with a long backlog of purchases I felt confident.</p>
<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>
<p>That realistic goal setting turned out to be the perfect motivation. Once I had worked my way through the books I had waiting, there was a considerable lag in the middle of the year. However, with confidence in my heart and the positive results I was experiencing, the motivation to read even a few pages a day really helped.</p>
<p>I finished the year completing 38 books. There were a few re-reads in there, but they all make up a fairly eclectic bunch that I have mostly enjoyed. Check them all out below.</p>
<div class="callout" style="margin:20px 0px; border: 1px solid var(--main-color); border-radius: 11px;">
<h2>Books Read in 2023</h2></a>
</div>
<p>More than the small feeling of satisfaction having met a goal set 12 months ago, is the difference it has made to my mind. I feel like I have made a small win in the fight for my attention. Taken back, something that I felt I was losing control of, and learnt plenty of lessons along the way. I love reading <a href="/2023/12/14/the-joy-of.html">now more than ever</a>, and I owe a thank you to the micro.blog community that pushed me there.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Finally launching with iOS 17.2 <a href="/2023/10/27/new-journalling-app.html">Apple’s new journal app</a> immediately received criticism. Whilst some of it was valid, most of this focused on features Apple did not promise. It delivered a very barebones app that gives me the impression it was for nothing more than showing off the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/tech-talks/111384/">Journaling API</a>. <em>My</em> thoughts are a lot more positive, and I thought I would run through how I use it.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/c4468f7f07.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>I have been journalling on and off for a while, but only really got <a href="/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html">serious in January</a> 2023. Adopting Day One to type out morning pages and other entries pretty religiously. Due to my short relationship to journalling apps, some may claim this restricts the validity of my opinions. I’m not on a <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/streak-story-bryce-evans/">two thousand day streak</a> or anything, but I will leave the level of authority I write with up to you.</p>
<h2 id="powerfullysimple">Powerfully Simple</h2>
<p>The reality is, the iOS Journal app is absolutely fine. It’s not as complex as some on the market, but I think that is the biggest positive. As much as I like using Day One, Apples app is actually a much better option for most people. It removes all the things that power users <em>may</em> need, like tagging and multiple journals, but replaces it with a much simpler experience.</p>
<p>In many ways, it reflects Apple’s user interface design perfectly. Removing as much complexity as possible to “tap thing, do action”. There are some great prompts and selections to fuel the content of your entires, from the aforementioned API, but all you need to do is tap the plus sign and start writing.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/45f716c7ff.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>This wonderfully simple interface makes me want to save more things. Record ideas, things I have done, and a lot more. There is no worrying about what journal to put it in, or styling to mess about with, just saving numerous things effortlessly. As you can see from my screenshots, I’ve taken to adding thoughts on how my training runs have gone, some podcast notes and even some blog post ideas — all in one place.</p>
<p>The app is not perfect, there’s no Mac or iPad app to start with. You could achieve the same result by simplifying Day One, as it <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/introducing-journaling-suggestions/">also has access to the new Journalling suggestions</a>, found by starting a new post and tapping the magic wand icon. I, personally, don’t need all the extra bits that Day One offers, so I can remove <em>another</em> cost from my subscriptions and still get all the benefits of journalling. If I can <a href="/2023/12/19/the-unremarkable-chronicles.html">work out what to write</a>!</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/12/20/my-handwriting-cant.html"><h1 class="p-name">My Handwriting Can’t Keep Up</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For years, I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out why my handwriting is so bad. Seriously, it&rsquo;s like what you&rsquo;d expect from a three-year-old. I often blame my years in higher education – anyone who&rsquo;s been through it knows that, unless you really put in the effort, your handwriting just stagnates after school. Everything has to be typed up neatly before submission, making pen and paper seem redundant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m digressing a bit, but that&rsquo;s usually my go-to explanation when, much to my dismay, someone catches a glimpse of my writing. This issue really came to the forefront recently when I had to write out some Christmas cards, a task I normally leave to my wife, who has flawless handwriting. Confronted with the task of writing on the cards, I was appalled at the mess I&rsquo;d made.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s odd is my fondness for jotting notes in a physical notebook. The brief notes and thoughts I jot down often require some deciphering, but it&rsquo;s when I have to write at length that my handwriting really deteriorates. Whenever I write morning pages, I choose to type them, contrary to popular advice to write them manually. I attribute this to my ability to type quickly enough to keep up with my thoughts, a realisation that recently struck me as the real issue.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/41673fd9c0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Before I started using Day One <a href="/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html">in January last year</a>, I watched every review and setup video available. Many emphasised the speed of typing over handwriting, and I agreed. My hand couldn&rsquo;t match the pace of my thoughts, which I saw as a drawback. So, I decided to subscribe and type instead of writing by hand. In reality, I didn&rsquo;t need to speed up my writing to match my thoughts; instead, I needed to slow my thoughts to match my writing pace.</p>
<p>This shift transformed an already effective practice for the better. My hand stopped cramping, and my words became clearer as I stopped rushing. Most importantly, I slowed my thought process to match my handwriting pace, allowing me to maintain and focus on my thoughts longer. In my haste to express and release them, I hadn&rsquo;t been giving them the necessary space. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still <a href="/2023/12/19/the-unremarkable-chronicles.html">struggle with what to write half the time</a>, but now, I relish the process of slowly and thoughtfully putting pen to paper.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I have tried. I have really tried to make this bloody journaling thing work. Unfortunately, I have no choice but to throw in the towel because I am genuinely stuck. If you&rsquo;re relying on prompts from the new journal API to spice up your daily entries, like I am, you to might hit a snag if your life is as uneventful as mine tends to be.</p>
<p>My mornings kick off religiously at 6am. It&rsquo;s a straightforward routine: get everything ready for Lucie&rsquo;s school departure a bit past 7, enjoy a solitary coffee, then play chauffeur for my wife to take her to work. Once back home, I&rsquo;m hunkered down in my home office, with film soundtracks as my loyal companions. Sounds like a script for a riveting blockbuster, right? Not exactly.</p>
<p>Sure, there are occasional deviations from the script. I go running, and sprinkle in the occasional podcasts. But really, what grand tales are there to narrate in a journal? It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m scaling mountains or traversing exotic jungles. What do you write about when your life doesn’t venture beyond the ordinary? Definitely not more navel-gazing or empty promises of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write more journal entries. I really super-duper promise this time”.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4243e890ac.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my very ordinariness that poses such a challenge to me. I realise that I am comparing <a href="/2021/05/31/insides-vs-outsides.html">my insides to other people&rsquo;s outsides</a> when I look for inspiration online. Yet still wonder how to make the mundane interesting? This also bleeds into my photography, I don’t go anywhere, nor do anything, intriguing. How do I find stories worth telling in a day that unfolds with the predictability of a sitcom rerun?</p>
<p>I don’t struggle for ideas for blog posts because they often abstract. Not born from my boring existence, created from a mind that wanders further than my feet. I can’t tell tales of my existence because there are none to tell. Don’t get me wrong, I am content with the predictability of my regular life, after all, not every day needs to be a headline-worthy adventure. I just long for some narrative to tell from within the folds of the everyday.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>In today&rsquo;s fast-paced world, the concept of &lsquo;hustle culture&rsquo; and the proliferation of productivity-focused videos on platforms like YouTube have become the norm. The underlying message in this sea of content is clear: to earn more, to achieve a higher status, and ultimately, to be &ldquo;successful”. This chase for success is often equated with a promise of increased happiness and a more fulfilling life. But is this relentless pursuit really the key to happiness?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that numerous studies have shown that while money can indeed <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/why-money-cant-buy-you-happiness">contribute to happiness</a>, it only does so up to a certain point. Beyond that, the correlation between <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/wealth/what-worlds-longest-happiness-study-says-about-money-2023-02-06/">wealth and happiness starts to fade</a>. This brings us to an intriguing thought – why not skip the middleman? Why immerse ourselves in a constant state of hustle and stress in the quest for happiness, when we could potentially find contentment in what we already have?</p>
<p>From my perspective, sitting in a comfortable home, surrounded by a loving family, and with a job I enjoy, it might be easy to preach contentment. I recognise that I speak from a position of relative privilege. However, the essence of my argument transcends material comforts. Happiness, as I see it, is not a distant goal to be reached. Rather, it&rsquo;s a mindset, a way of viewing and engaging with the world around us.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t to dismiss the value of ambition or the desire to improve one&rsquo;s circumstances. Striving for better is a natural and healthy aspect of human nature. However, when this striving becomes an endless cycle of wanting more, it can lead to a perpetual state of dissatisfaction. We begin to place our happiness in a future that&rsquo;s always just out of reach, constantly moving the goalposts as soon as we achieve our latest objective.</p>
<p>So, while there&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with seeking success or improvement, it&rsquo;s crucial to balance these ambitions with an appreciation for the present. It&rsquo;s about finding joy in the journey, not just the destination. This balance is perhaps the true key to a happy, fulfilled life – a life where we strive for better, but also take the time to appreciate and find joy in where we are right now.</p>

      <p>For a few years I have been <a href="/2021/02/18/whats-essential-to.html">banging on about the indie web</a>, <a href="/2021/02/18/webmentions-to-avoid.html">webmention</a> and <a href="/2023/07/10/openness-is-the.html">Activitypub</a>. Since moving to micro.blog in 2018, these principles at first went over my head and are now what I believe the web should be built on. These thoughts are not exclusively mine, but in the last few months, plenty of people have begun to share this belief since the downfall of Twitter. Although there have been strides to move in this direction, the abundance of new social networks have increased my desire to just post in one place.</p>
<p>The new social network on the block is Threads, and despite all my distain for attention seeking, fast-paced social networks, particularly one run by Meta, I actually enjoy using it. Most of the people that I haven’t been keeping up with for the past 18 months because they stayed on Twitter have taken up space there. Despite hating the service, I feel like I have a lot of my friends back. Very apt that I would round this post off today, but I loved it until very recently.</p>
<p>Whilst writing a blog post, I wanted to link to a post I had made, but couldn’t remember where I had posted it to. After a not insignificant amount of time, I found it on Mastodon, but before I moved to micro.blog for everything and the epiphany hit. Much like my <a href="/2023/11/04/posse-is-too.html">ramblings on POSSE</a> and the amount of work it needs, spreading myself over several networks is absolutely not a position I want to be in either.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it does <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C0zXcQmxO77">look as if</a> ActivityPub integration on Threads is finally coming, and I can follow all my friends again. For now though, and what was always the plan anyway, I will continue to post to my blog. I can read, reply and interact with everything I need to hear, it’s just easier. You can find me anywhere ActivityPub is <code>@greg@gr36.com</code>.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When I <a href="/2018/05/25/youxre-not-cool.html">first moved to micro.blog</a> I had this dream that I would be able to write and publish freely. By removing the worry about what to post where and how it looked <em>should</em> have released more posts into the world. No stress from separating what goes on my blog and what goes on social media. By publishing whatever I wanted, however I wanted, I freed myself up to do more. Yet here I am years later, still trying to have a ‘proper blog’.</p>
<p>I still sit down with an idea, or two, looking to flesh it out and hit a magic 300 word mark where I start to think it might be publishable. Someone put this limit in my head years ago, possibly for SEO on a proper blog, and since then, I have always stuck to it. Titled properly, with an image for the rich link previews. Then and only then could I even <em>think</em> about it going live.</p>
<p>When the reality is, none of this matters. The way I, or anyone, formats their blog posts means exactly nothing. In fact, in some weird <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270844183_The_Red_Sneakers_Effect_Inferring_Status_and_Competence_from_Signals_of_Nonconformity#:~:text=A%20series%20of%20studies%20demonstrates,for%20uniqueness%20in%20the%20observers.">Red Sneaker Effect attempts</a>, numerous publications are trying new things and evolving the way posts are structured. Yet here I am, asking ChatGPT to make me an image and worrying about these limits <strong>that I impose on myself</strong>.</p>
<p>I went so far before as hiding away my shorter posts from my home pages, but now show them along with everything else. I will continue to exclude these in the main RSS feed, and I do think that a lot of my ideas need to be developed and fleshed out to see if they even make sense. As <a href="/2023/12/06/my-words-when.html">I discussed before,</a> I use this process as personal development, but that doesn’t mean I can’t hit publish.</p>
<div class="callout pink_callout">
🤦🏻‍♂️ The entirety of this post that I have been talking to myself about publishing more things, I have still been looking at the word counter and making sure it gets up high enough - but I didn't include an image. It's a start.

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>This past April, I hit a bit of a snag with my journaling. I had this <a href="/2023/02/11/do-i-even.html">idea in my head</a> that I&rsquo;d be one of those people with a <a href="/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html">notebook always at hand</a>, filled with insightful notes and daily reflections. Ready to write the best blog posts you’ve ever read — but the truth is, it wasn&rsquo;t working out like that. I went on holiday this summer and didn&rsquo;t miss scribbling in my notebook, which made me stop and think.</p>
<p>There was <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">a time around last Christmas</a> when I was really into it. I had convinced myself that this daily writing was the key to my happiness. But after a while, I realised that it wasn&rsquo;t the act of writing that made me happy; it was me figuring out things for myself. Sure, the people and things I care about (like my family) can give me a boost, but at the end of the day, my happiness is up to me.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/62011d1bd4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about writing by hand that feels right to me, even though it&rsquo;s slower than typing, and you can&rsquo;t just hit &lsquo;search&rsquo; to find something you wrote. But for some reason, I just stopped using my notebook for a few months. It&rsquo;s like it went into hibernation or something. Eventually, it just stopped being a part of my routine, and by the time summer came around, I had stopped using it altogether.</p>
<p>One has always been close by, but just sitting and waiting for me to pick it back up again. I had the occasional flick through it to find an idea or a quote I remember writing down, but always placing it back down again with a promise to start using it once more. Perhaps that day is today. Well, the past week or so, actually. I drew a line under everything, metaphorically and physically. I&rsquo;ve got a new notebook now, and I&rsquo;m ready to give it another shot.</p>
<p>Notebooks might come and go, but I&rsquo;m sticking with it.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Can I come straight out and say it? I love reading, and books are my favourite. That gets all the disclaimers out of the way and makes my probable bias obvious right from the start. However, there is something about reading books that not only entertains me but means I learn more along the way, and the web will never replace that.</p>
<p>Books receive a lot of criticism. Even perceived intellectuals, like the now-disgraced crypto guru SBF, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/29/sam-bankman-fried-reading-effective-altruism/">fail to see the value in books</a>. They are denounced as “too slow” or not “entertaining enough” by a range of people who seem to think information should be mainlined into their veins. There is more to reading a book specifically that many people seem to miss - and <a href="/2022/04/10/reading-doesnxt-need.html">reading doesn’t need to be hacked</a>!</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7ce720a7ca.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The entire experience of touching and turning pages might seem redundant, but that tactile chore is the very point. Research by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227608869_Hypertext_fiction_reading_Haptics_and_immersion">Anne Mangen has shown</a> a crucial link between the sensory and motor experience of reading a physical book. It draws not just on our sense of sight but also on our sense of touch, changing the depth of attention paid to words on a page compared to words on a screen.</p>
<p>My personal ranting about <a href="/2023/06/29/find-the-what.html">books that should have been blog posts</a> does hide my enjoyment of reading them. There is something enjoyable about taking in someone’s prose that goes around the houses a bit and reinforces their ideas with real-life examples. While straight-to-the-point blog posts, like the one you’re reading now, have their place, there is joy in the ramble. The slow pulling back of the curtain to reveal new ideas, rather than a yanking of the cover and pointing, is delightful.</p>
<p>I am reminded of the habit all students get into of relying on Cliffnotes for books they&rsquo;re supposed to read. Shoving the information straight into my brain instead of the steady drip from long text never worked. Nowadays, there are several companies out there summarising books and even films so you can act as if you consumed the content without actually doing the work. All of which achieve results, but lack that something special.</p>
<p>Much like my <a href="/2019/04/29/skipping-silence.html">enjoyment of the pauses in podcasts</a>, I think this comes from my tendency to <a href="/2023/09/09/i-enjoy-being.html">enjoy being slow</a>, but I find taking the time to read a book. A ‘real’ book if I can, adds so much to the enjoyment.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Perhaps I have listened to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/modern-wisdom/id1347973549?i=1000637768699">too many bro-podcasts</a> over the last few days, but I am led to believe that a massive fear of failure exists in people. I fail at so many things that perhaps I am desensitised to the whole experience, but there is absolutely nothing to fear from not getting the result you wanted.</p>
<p>I should preface this with a warning about taking unneeded risks and not ruining things that make huge changes to your life — but outside this, fail hard and often. Failure is the way you find out what suits you best. It’s the way to round off the corners of all the square things you find to make sure something fits as you need it to. As Alain de Botton <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success">elegantly put it</a> “It’s bad enough not getting what you want, but it’s even worse getting to the end and realising it isn’t what you wanted”.</p>
<img src="uploads/2024/d03f197ae4.jpg" alt="" />
<p>How on earth do you even know what you want without failing at a million things first? I’ve tried <a href="/2023/11/22/my-big-flip.html">Flip phones</a>, and <a href="/2022/12/31/i-really-want.html">journals</a>, notebooks, and hundreds of other things. All which fell flat on their face, and from the failure I learnt lessons, and improved the way my life works.</p>
<p>None of these things I pointed out above matter, it’s easy to fail at these things. Don’t even get me started on the declined job applications, rebuffed dating advances and miserable attempts at being a writer. A<a href="/2022/01/06/it-depends-on.html">t the time some of them seemed like world ending events</a>, but I learnt things, I worked out what I wanted and and moved forward. </p>
<p>In many way I learnt how to fail and now I will never shy away from trying new things. Exploring my thoughts around subjects. Working out a millions ways to do a job before I dive in. Throwing a high percentage of draft blog posts into the bin. There is nothing wrong with any of these things, it is the not doing part that sucks. The wondering what if, or the missed opportunity because fear froze you. That sucks, failure doesn’t. </p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>If you’ve read more than 2 of my blog posts, you will know <a href="/2021/04/16/back-as-far.html">I yearn for a simpler time</a>. A time pre-smartphone, where everything didn’t rely on my having a computer in my pocket — whilst also loving technology. There is no getting away from the feelings, but I have become to realise that if you are not paying attention, how ridiculous the pursuit of less can become.</p>
<p>One of my favourite sub-Reddits is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbphones/">r/dumbphones</a>, it is wonderful to see the phones people are still using and the ones available if you look hard enough. From old school Nokia remakes to <a href="https://www.catphones.com/en-us/cat-s22-flip/">mixes of flip phone keypads and Android</a>. One of the post tends recently has been everyday carries, and seeing people using a flip phone and a notepad gives me hope. Then I see others lugging around a dumb phone, MP3 player, camera, kindle, and even more things — and that brings me back to reality.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3b998d1faa.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This was one of the reasons I failed my flip phone experiment. At some point, you just have to realise that all this stuff is a bit ridiculous. This is no slight against the person posting in the screenshot above, it is more a revelation for me. The reason smartphones caught on so quickly is they cannibalised all of these extra things we used to carry around. They made our life easier, and going backwards is not always the way.</p>
<p>By having a smartphone in my pocket, am I actually making my life simpler. I have in my pocket a camera, kindle, music player, writing device and much more. There is a lot to be said for <a href="/2019/12/17/intentional-barriers.html">intentional barriers</a> but carrying around all of these extra things doesn’t simplify anything. It just adds complexity. To carry on using a flip phone, past the week or so I managed, I would need to buy more devices when I can just exercise some self-control.</p>
<p>Which indeed is easier said than done, but it’s something to think about. I’m not completely convinced by <a href="https://stolenfocusbook.com/audio/">Nir Eyal and his insistence that destruction is our personal fault</a>, but I must take some responsibility. The solution is often not a worse experience, it is just to use the tool you have, well.</p>

      <p>There’s a line I hear a lot when people get preachy about being online too much or using social media. “When you’re on your deathbed, you will wish you weren’t on your phone so much” or some paraphrase of this is reeled off again and again. Mainly because it’s probably true. I’ve written before <a href="/2022/09/21/this-might-be.html">about longing for the things you hate when they’ve gone,</a> and it often causes me to pause and think about my blog.</p>
<p>Should I lie on this hypothetical deathbed, hopefully decades from now, what will I wish I had done differently? I won’t wish I spent less time on social media, I met most of the people to interact with there, well maybe I should have shaved a few months to a year off my usage towards the end. I would definitely wish I posted more to my blog though, it doesn’t feel like wasted time regardless of the external results.</p>
<p>Publishing here feels like I am at least trying to leave something behind. I’m not lucky enough to be good enough to write a book, so I guess this is the next best thing. It is my only wish that should I pass on, it stays behind as my one and only legacy, a side from my kids, of course. I’m not a big blogger. I don’t get thousands of ‘hits’ and you could be reading this thinking what on earth does this rubbish need to stay alive for. I’d tend to agree, it’s just something I think about.</p>
<p>I love writing, publishing, and interacting with people about my thoughts and ideas. Many of them are formed, flexed and even broken through online discourse and I value all the time and effort it takes. <a href="https://lili.bearblog.dev/if-writing-changes-me-let-it-change-me-for-the-better/">Writing changes you</a>, it helps form ideas, and I find so much about myself just by typing out my internal monologue. So much so that when the time does come to cross the rainbow bridge I think I would miss it most of all.</p>
<p>These thoughts bring me to thinking about the discoverability of my writing. Not in an SEO way, but the people I care about being able to read the things I think about and the thoughts that are important to me. I want people to be able to flick through the pages of my journals and take something from them. If my son ever thinks “what would dad do” I want him to be able to find out. To search through my blog posts and have me talk to him.</p>
<p>The morbidness of this train of thought is not lost on me. I don’t think others in my position have these desires. But when I am gone, I want to still be around.</p>

      <p>Have you ever developed new habits or changed existing ones without realising it? There isn’t an abrupt shift, but rather a gradual evolution in your subconscious mind. You suddenly &lsquo;wake up&rsquo; to this change with a sense of surprise. This realisation hit me today when I went for my daily walk with my dog and my headphones died. I&rsquo;m not even sure when I began to wear them for my walks, but their sudden absence made me acutely aware of my new routine.</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my walk today. There’s something special about the slight chill in the air paired with the warmth of the sun that I find delightful. It&rsquo;s an odd time of year when you need both a hat and gloves as well as sunglasses, but I think it&rsquo;s the perfect balance. That might seem like a tangent, but perhaps being alone with my thoughts allowed me to appreciate it more. Unwittingly, I had been walking with my AirPods for the last few days, listening to podcasts or audiobooks, which meant I was never truly alone.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s nothing inherently wrong with listening to something while walking. However, I find that excessive consumption of content prevents me from fully developing my own ideas. The ideas I do have, influenced by various media, never seem to fully materialise or reach a conclusion if there’s a constant influx of new ones. Podcasts, in particular, tend to spark new thoughts or introduce intriguing topics, but I <em>need</em> those interludes of silence to explore and expand on them before moving on to the next.</p>
<p>There are already numerous thoughts occupying space in my mind, most of which I tend to overanalyse, without the addition of new ones pouring in. That is why <a href="/2021/03/14/the-importance-of.html">I value silence</a> and downtime so much. It enables me to read a book, jot down notes, or just <a href="/2023/09/09/i-enjoy-being.html">embrace a slower pace</a>, which in turn allows me to operate at full capacity when necessary. However, this doesn&rsquo;t make it any easier when <a href="https://wheresyoured.at/p/sam-altman-freed">a company I am interested in implodes</a> over the course of a week leading to an influx of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/podcasts/hard-fork-altman-openai-rehired.html">emergency podcasts</a>!</p>
<p>Over the years, I have learned to appreciate the uncomfortable sensation of boredom and not to shun it. I see many people who cannot stand to be unoccupied, and I believe that being comfortable with boredom is an important skill for self-discovery. The desire for constant entertainment is pervasive and seems problematic. As I discovered today, despite the world being filled with distractions, sometimes all I really need is silence.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/11/22/my-big-flip.html"><h1 class="p-name">My Big Flip Phone Failure</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I have been trying to write this post for a very long time. Trying to outline my <a href="/2023/08/23/my-big-flip.html">experiment of using a flip phone again</a> because it is the culmination of a few years of wanting to try it, knowing I can’t and then slowly walking myself back from the edge. This time my wife pushed me over the edge with words along the line of “stop talking about it and do it” with comical results and some realisations along the way.</p>
<p>I say this with the knowledge that I have written and rewritten this post quite a few times. I hoped that my thoughts would come easily as they are plentiful, but my fear was that they could be judged as more than a little preachy. This would have destroyed the message behind this post and removed any hope of people reading it. So I hope this version finds the right spot in your motivation to keep reading. It circles a realisation I had about a week into the experiment and applies to numerous things in tech circles.</p>
<p>On the first boot of my sim being in a new Nokia 2660, I hit barriers. The phone cost me a whopping £25 from a local business and ticked all the boxes I wanted it to tick, but the barriers came from other places. There is no way to transfer contacts over, so I had to spend quite a bit of time doing the new phone dance that people of a certain age will remember. Typing all the numbers and contact names in on the t9 keypad, that after ten minutes, made my hand cramp. I used to be able to send a text without even looking, and although some muscle memory remained, the dexterity to do so did not.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/be322f6dde.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Once this was done, I put the phone down and stared at it. You see, the great thing about a dumb phone, although this particular model <em>did</em> have Facebook installed, is that there is nothing to do with it. Outside the occasional game of snake, unless the phone beeped, or I needed to contact someone, it never moved from the table in my kitchen. For something to do, I even when and connected it to my car&rsquo;s bluetooth, which went about as easily as any other phone I have used. Which was frustrating because I expected to hit more annoyances than this. How dare this ridiculous phone be easy to use and peaceful.</p>
<p>Truth be told, for the first couple of days, I wished we had never moved past this stage in the mobile phone evolution. I wanted to stay with this device that asked absolutely nothing from me. It delivered on everything it promises, which is next to nothing, and that was one with me. That&rsquo;s the thing about weekends though, they are not the indicator of normal usage, and once the week rolled around I was sure the issues would start showing up. Secretly hoping I would have a good enough excuse to shove my sim back into a phone it deserved. Unfortunately, nothing major happened.</p>
<p>The calls were answered. Texts were replaced with telephone calls because it couldn’t be bothered to give myself hand cramp. Most importantly, no-one was any the wiser. This marvellous device sat on my desk next to my computer and did exactly what was asked of it. It wasn’t until the dawn of the third day that I began to release what I needed from a phone. It came in the most embarrassing of situations, at the front of a queue of people trying to pay for something. My card would not work for whatever reason and I had no way of getting another one, nor using a banking app.</p>
<p>I walked away in a grump, with my dumb phone in my hand and simmering over imagined sniggering from people in the queue behind. Curse my desire for a simple life and not having the world at my fingertips when I most needed it. It suddenly occurred to me — well once I had been home, sorted my card out, and then gone to a <em>different shop</em> to buy the things I required — that I do need my device to do more. I began to think of all the occasions where I might need a device with me. Quickly putting together ideas of how I could overcome them.</p>
<p>I ran through them all in my mind to make sure I could solve these problems and continue in blissful device silence. Banking was simple. I return to carrying a wallet with me at all times. The next one was running, that would require a new watch because I can’t use my beloved Apple Watch now. Something simple will do, a cheep Casio and a good route planning session to log my milage means I can jump that hurdle effortlessly. Podcasts on long runs might take a bit more thought.</p>
<p>After exploring the web for MP3 devices, which there are quite a few of even with the rise of smartphones, the possibility of more expenditure started to pull the curtain down on my experiment. Not because of the cost, a simple MP3 player with bluetooth is around £40, but more because of the hassle. I could download the episodes I want to listen to, convert them to MP3 and then put them on the device. Worry about keeping it charged and tracking my run on a new watch. Or I could just use Apple Watch as I have done for years.</p>
<p>I could ask for paper menus and order forms in places that relied on QR code scanning or online ordering. Printing out things I needed to have with me, or writing them in <a href="/2023/03/12/what-is-my.html">my notebook</a>. All the issues that cropped up had solutions, but after a certain point the juice wasn’t worth the squeeze. Despite all the attention it tended to suck away, and all the outlay it cost — the smartphone has pushed itself into my life to such a point that it is just easier to have one. That sucks.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There are numerous tech things I am intentionally quiet about. Not because I don’t have thoughts about them, but because I would rather not add to the noise of initial emotion blog posts and hot takes. The <a href="https://hu.ma.ne/aipin">Humane AI Pin</a> was one of those things, and while I don’t see it catching on, I think it is a fascinating device because of what it signals.</p>
<p>For years now, technology commentators have been theorising on what comes after the smartphone. It’s explosive success in shaping our lives and how we interact with the world around us is nothing short of remarkable. Although we can debate the positivity of them, there is no denying that the societal changes we have experienced well exceed those caused by similar cultural shifts.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f85131c6f4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This oblong glass and metal device I am typing this blog post on is nothing short of a technological marvel. One that we could not even dream of a decade ago, yet we are searching for <em>the next thing</em> already. For years, many people have been expecting voice first interaction to become the prominent interaction method. No more typing on screens, you speak to something, and it does the heavy lifting for you. It’s easy to forget this vision of easier interaction with your device and view the Ai Pin from its marketing alone.</p>
<p>Right from the start, the device has been developed and now launched differently to what we expected. There’s nothing wrong with that, but the self-importance of the <a href="https://vimeo.com/882968794">companies launch video</a> overshadows the entire device. The successfulness of the device aside (I am very much of the opinion it will fall flat on its face) it says a lot about the future of devices. The one seen by technology investors, and how much they differentiate from regular users.</p>
<p>Although voice first interaction hasn’t caught on as quickly as expected, and many devices have had to go back to putting screens on them, there’s still <em>something</em> there. It’s either a dream, or a marketing push, but the voice first idea clings to the back of my mind with a certain level of excitement. It wasn’t until I really thought about the ridiculousness of wearing a pin on my clothes, or the worse possibility of <a href="/2016/10/10/please-dont-put.html">something on my face</a>, that I came to understand the issues as I see them.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/46e0c533ff.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The truth is, voice first doesn’t need to be voice only. Now granted, the AI Pin <em>does</em> have an over-engineered laser projector. This requires a series of dexterous gestures to interact, which in itself is enough to pull your phone out and do the same thing in a couple of taps. What they really want you to do is push the button and talk to it. Transmitting everything over the constant internet connection to be interpreted, and a response beamed back to you. Let’s hope you never go out of a reliable signal.</p>
<p>You can issue commands like “catch me up” to be read your latest emails and text messages. A command that I expect won&rsquo;t return “nothing, no one likes you” but speaks to the kind of person AI wants to market the device to, or perhaps who purchasers wish to be. This is something that may not raise an eyebrow in Silicon Valley circles, but <em>will</em> on your local high street. What companies fail to realise that the acceptability of voice interaction is varied, and this device must sit in the Venn diagram overlap of <em>can talk to a computer</em> and <em>wearing clothes sufficient to sustain <a href="https://musictech.com/news/gear/humane-ai-pin/#:~:text=It%27s%20a%20small%2C%20square%20device,can%20be%20attached%20to%20clothing.">“the same weight as a tennis ball”.</a></em></p>
<p>I suspect this sits is the same tech douch zone as Juicero, Google Glass and Dyson Zone. The aims of Humane are noble ones, to reduce the time spent using devices that take us away from the world around us. Ensuring that we can use technology in a way that doesn’t impact our attention. Forgetting that there is a far more socially acceptable option of device, one that I am a big fan of—the smartwatch.</p>
<p>After years of wearing an Apple Watch, my preferred interaction method with it, outside simple taps, is by far voice. The watch is already a device people are used to seeing, it fits into life perfectly. There’s nothing on my face and no weird badge sagging my clothes down. I remain convinced it is the best <a href="/2022/02/10/the-ultimate-minimalist.html">minimalist phone you can buy</a>, and wish it were my main device. I have a feeling that had Humane stated with such a device and then pushed into other areas it may have gone down better, but there is always a desire for something new and different.</p>
<p>A new interaction method takes time to find its space in society, like the smartphone. Some never reach that place and die out like Google Glass, and it remains to be seen how long Humane can hang in there. Working to persuade people that the learning curve is worth it. Voice first and lasers seems like an interesting proposition, but new doesn’t always mean good.</p>

      <p>I spotted an <a href="https://c.im/@nickheer/111412577184081322">interesting post by Nick Heer</a> this morning while catching up (also, you should be <a href="https://pxlnv.com/">reading his blog</a>; it’s great). He presents the idea that sometimes hardware is as much of a barrier to switching platforms as software is, which is often overlooked by those considering doing so.</p>
<p>The barrier to switching from, say, an iPhone to Android is usually thought to be software — iMessage, for instance, comes up frequently. However, I think Nick has a valid point worth considering. I started to think about the reasons why I tend to stick with Apple products, particularly the iPhone, and really, it boils down to three areas: hardware quality, with a focus on the camera, and the app ecosystem.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/37ddba125b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>I have written about <a href="/2020/11/14/my-journey-to.html">my journey of becoming entrenched in the Apple ecosystem</a>. Until the iPhone 5s, I was a dedicated Android user. I had used the iPhone 3G for a while but didn’t truly enjoy it, and bought my first Android phone, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus">Galaxy Nexus</a>. The reason I switched to an iPhone, after a considerable succession of Android phones that never really met the mark, was the hardware.</p>
<p>They all promised to fix short battery life or offer a camera that wasn’t subpar, and I was fed up with having to hack my phone to make it work well. I enjoyed using phones like the Moto X and the Nexus series, but they all left me feeling overall disappointment. The iPhone 5s resolved all the issues I had with poor build quality and disappointing hardware in one fell swoop. It came in a high-quality, really nice feeling package, and I no longer worried about capturing a good photo.</p>
<p>Taking good pictures on Android phones was too laborious. I had to install other camera apps or make other technical adjustments to achieve the desired results. I don’t feel that is the case any more; Android phones are on par with the hardware quality of iPhones, offering more interesting form factors beyond the glass and metal oblong Apple adheres to.</p>
<p>I am no stranger to using Android phones, having recently used the Galaxy Z Fold 5, Pixel Fold, and S23 Ultra for an extended period. What now affects switching is my completely subjective opinion on the pictures from these phones. I am not a fan of the oversaturated Samsung images, nor the processing of the Pixel phones. So, I now stick to iPhones due to my personal tastes; there is no other barrier apart from <em>my</em> preference.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/743ab8da23.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>I used to love Android for its utility, constant introduction of new features, and the freedom to customise my phone as I desired. Much of that remains true; however, every time I use it now, I am confused about whose phone it is. Android, in its various forms, seems to push Google services in my face, or adverts if you use a Samsung phone.</p>
<p>The good news is you can usually turn most of these features off and make the phone your own. It just takes more time than it used to, and compared to iPhones, it offers a level of customisation that Apple will never allow. Comparing the OS is a bit like comparing apples to oranges, but what I particularly dislike is the disparity in app quality.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2b8dfd65f8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This might be down to the types of apps I use and the fact that I first used them on Apple devices. However, that doesn’t excuse the inferior quality of some cross-platform attempts. That is, if the app is even available, as the likes of <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com">Matter</a> and <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a> just aren’t there. This is no fault of Google or Android, but it is a consideration when thinking about switching. It keeps me using iOS instead of searching for alternatives; the cost versus reward doesn’t add up <strong>for me</strong>.</p>
<p>Another point worth mentioning, and what was the deciding factor in getting an iPhone in the first place, is the ecosystem. I was introduced to it with an iPad. I won&rsquo;t ever switch to Windows unless forced, so it just makes sense for me to have the whole Apple package. Every so often, I think I am one of the iSheep people mock, but if that’s the case, I am content knowing what to do and how to get the most out of my ecosystem. Even if, at times, it is frustrating to be so confined.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>As I wrote about twice in the preceding days, I use Apple Notes for everything, but I always keep an eye on, and test the new features of Bear. So I&rsquo;d like to share a few thoughts on its recent updates and the celebration of its seventh anniversary. The past year has brought notable changes, including their 2.0 update, and the improvements coming look fascinating.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/288ff7e140.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Bear 2 launched in July with significant updates including tables, nested styles, pinned tags, and <a href="https://blog.bear.app/2023/07/bear-2-is-here/">quite a bit more</a>. My biggest takeaway from testing the beta for a few months was the cleaner Markdown formatting. It tidied up all the issues I have with most other Markdown editors and allowed me to write my favoured way but not have too much markup in the way. It also brought in folding text sections, sketching tools on iOS, GIF support, and footnotes among other things.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a5fa9bdcf7.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="an-anniversary-with-basic-apple-guy">An Anniversary With Basic Apple Guy</h2>
<p>The new update for their anniversary brought in new customisation options, including a collaboration with <a href="https://basicappleguy.com">Basic Apple Guy</a> for a new icon is an interesting move, highlighting Bear&rsquo;s engagement with the wider Apple community. It’s a neat addition for fans of both the app and Apple-themed designs.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://mailchi.mp/shinyfrog/bear-turns-7?e=0fbdccc28f">recent email</a> they also highlighted an upcoming Quick Open UI on Mac which looks really helpful. It’s good to see an app evolve based on user needs, and for such a niche note-taking app to be around for 7 years later makes me happy. It has some really engaged users, and their development over time, although slow, is very responsive to what its users want.</p>
<p>If you are <a href="/2021/03/19/looking-for-my.html">looking for a more advanced note app</a> that doesn’t overcomplicate things, I will always point to Bear Notes. They don’t pay me or anything, I just think it’s a really great, well-designed app and long may it continue.</p>

      <p>After a full morning of running around in the head office and helping everyone out, I needed to get out and catch up on things, but didn’t want to go home. So I went on the next instalment of <a href="/2023/11/08/coffee-shop-adventures.html" title="Coffee Shop Adventures">coffee shop adventures</a> and stopped off for a <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/worklife/a25745513/new-costa-menu/">Black Forest Hot Chocolate</a> on the way back.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4c963ab600.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There’s no quaint little coffee establishment this time. It is a full-on capitalist franchise, Costa Coffee. That is a bit OTT because I quite like Costa Coffee and the staff in this one are always nice. I also can’t complain about a place that I can park freely right outside and not have to worry about navigating shoppers.</p>
<p>There’s no wave of MacBooks this time either, the place isn’t empty, but it’s full of people meeting and actually drinking coffee. As such, I feel really self-conscious sat typing on this massive laptop, but I am sure I am not far away from it being full of people tapping away whist taking Friday night sales calls - speaking from experience.</p>
<p>I am already used to the keyboard positioning on the 16” MacBook, but I still have a few reservations and wholeheartedly think that the 14” is the version people should go for. However, I love the larger screen and doing some design work, which is precisely what I should be doing now, is <em>actually</em> possible away from a monitor.</p>
<p>I guess it always was, but never the best experience. Working on elements are much easier to see, and I enjoy working out and about now. Perhaps that is what much of the 16” MacBook, and even which MacBook to buy as a whole, is about. Most things are possible on all versions, but ‘better’ specs can make your tasks more enjoyable and you need to weigh up where the line is.</p>
<p>If the only difference that upgrading my laptop has made is being able to work in more places, that to me is worth it. It is easily £3,000 worth of value and enjoyment, but would be complete overkill for others.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Since sharing some thoughts on the default apps blogging trend yesterday, I have had a few emails from some people, which is always nice, asking about even the few apps I did highlight. So I thought I would concede that perhaps even <em>my</em> setup might be interesting and share my homescreen for the first time <a href="/2021/12/21/my-homescreen-to.html">since 2021</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bde627dddb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I don’t like to have many apps on my actual homescreen, as that tends to prompt me into usage that I don’t want to have. All the apps on the last two rows are to encourage me to do something useful, or the apps that I use the most but won’t trick me into engaging with them longer than needed.</p>
<p><strong>Day One</strong> - I <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html" title="2023-01-29  4:48 pm">journal as much as I can</a>. Although <a href="/2023/10/27/new-journalling-app.html">the Apple App</a> shows good promise, it doesn’t live up to <a href="/2017/12/20/journaling-with-day.html">Day One</a> yet.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Notes</strong> - I use Apple Notes for everything, and <a href="/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html">I think you should too</a>. Even more so <a href="/2023/07/04/apple-notes-is.html">now that iOS17 is out</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LIghtroom</strong> - I use this to edit all of my photos, be it mobile or with a real camera.</p>
<p><strong>Matter</strong> - The <a href="/2022/12/14/matter-my-most.html" title="2022-12-14 12:03 pm">best read it later services I have tried</a>. I can save articles, videos, and podcasts that will also be transcribed for me to use the information later.</p>
<p><strong>Ulysses</strong> - I <a href="/2021/03/19/looking-for-my.html" title="2021-03-19 10:43 am">mess around trying to replace it</a> every so often, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>micro.blog</strong> - Speaks for itself, it’s where this post was published!</p>
<p><strong>Brain.fm</strong> - I tried to hack my creativity and inspiration, and <a href="/2021/12/18/brain-fm-the.html">I love this app</a> for background noise in my headphones when I am working.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> - this is a recent dalliance with LLM’s to aid my working life. I used <a href="https://www.notion.so/product/ai?utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=19760657944&amp;utm_medium=147709666538&amp;utm_content=649989555747&amp;utm_term=notion%20ai&amp;targetid=kwd-1547008718840&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAxreqBhAxEiwAfGfndCPRhy7XWany2brk2LFBzcrZAdY4577WKmFDtdEap-btiyw4-qbvuRoCvdcQAvD_BwE">Claude in Notion</a> for a while, but nothing comes close to GPT4. You’ll notice some <a href="/2023/11/08/i-really-like.html">images created with Dall.e 3</a> creeping in to my blog too.</p>
<p>If you have any more questions about apps, feel free to ask, using the buttons below. The orange app with the white squiggle on it is where I book my martial arts classes, I can’t find the source of the wallpaper so can’t distribute it I am afraid. Apart from that, I think everything is pretty boring.</p>

      <p>I love a good blogging trend, me. I don’t always join in with them, but this time around it has even brought <a href="https://acn.lol/2023/11/07/default-apps">Andy Nicolaides out of retirement</a>. So I thought about sharing mine. Deciding against it in the end because I don’t have much to share, but as <a href="/2023/11/08/coffee-shop-adventures.html">I said yesterday</a>, I have embraced the fact that I have to have a good think about why first.</p>
<p>This trend is sharing the default apps we are using. Nothing more. It asks very little of a person, but we all know that it says a lot about us instead. I’ve seen some replies similar to “what an Apple fanboy” but in the general sense, we are all searching for that special needle in a haystack “Ah Hah” moment of finding something new.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5a927afc22.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We are constantly told that technology improvements are not exciting any more. I would disagree, particularly currently, due to augmented reality and AI promising a different computer interaction paradigm. There is some admission though that most new products don’t scratch the itch they used to. The days of massive improvement when a new OS came out, or my Android faithful will remember waiting for a new ROM release was enough excitement to keep you up at night.</p>
<p>Now, particularly in the apps space, everything seems like the last one that went before it and very little improvement to be found. Unless, of course, you can dig through the recommendations of those with a similar use cases to you and find out what they are using. I have avoided such a process, and read very few of them because I know I will find an app, and <a href="/2019/07/29/a-new-productivity.html">be off down a rabbit hole</a> and spend more time moving things around.</p>
<p>As such, I tend to stick to default apps unless I hit a ceiling. Apps like Fantastical sit in place of Apple calendar because it displays information better for working and time blocking. Todoist manages my tasks because it is easer to get them in and schedule them around. Take away my working life, and none of these types of apps make sense for me to use. The only shout-out I could possibly give is for <a href="https://getmatter.app">Matter</a> - but again, it is very niche and expensive if you&rsquo;re not into saving lots of content.</p>
<p>I apologise for being boring, I wish you all the best in finding new and exciting things. Don’t spend too much money but enjoy yourselves!</p>

      <p>Bar a couple of months in early 2022, I have been working from home now for more than three years. It&rsquo;s a great existence, means in can concentrate better, look after my beloved dog and also be around for my family in the school holidays. I would however like to mention that it can be a bit lonely at times and I want to change that no my contract is fully remote.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I went with a 16” MacBook this time was the idea that I could work a bit better away from home, and as my m3 pro was delivered yesterday, off I went. I wouldn&rsquo;t feel myself if I didn&rsquo;t have a bit of think about why I wanted to go though. SO it took me a couple of hours to talk myself into it.</p>
<p>I didn’t want this to be an adventure of ego. You’ve seen the people I am talking about. MacBook Pro out, headphones on, not really doing much but want to be seen with their shiny laptop. I would rather not be one of those people. I definitely wasn’t going to out to show off my new Space Black MacBook. I don’t think.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/789763965e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Anyway. I wasn’t alone. It appears that everyone does this. I went to a nice local family run place called <a href="https://kitchenandcoffee.co.uk">Kitchen and Coffee</a> that brews nice drinks and the tables were awash with MacBooks. Just MacBooks. No other type of computer to be seen, which, I thought was weird. No other Space Black ones, I checked. Twice. Certainly, not showing off, I think.</p>
<p>I don’t feel uncomfortable opening this massive machine and typing away on what seems to be the same size keyboard as my old 14” but dwarfed by speakers on either side that are throwing off my typing. I hadn’t realised just how much of my finger placement was dependent on feeling the sides of my laptop with my hands, and I am conscious of hitting the ginormous trackpad, so my wrists hurt already.</p>
<p>Why is the trackpad so massive though? There&rsquo;s no reason for it. No added benefit or increased functionality. It’s just there to fill the space, what a weird design choice. Now I am staring at my laptop weirdly, and I am conscious people are looking. The good thing is that it seems to reject my palms resting on it, so no false touches to report as yet.</p>
<p>Just as I am starting to think this purchase was a mistake and running through my options to return it and buy a smaller version, I realise the size of the screen. I have two windows open side by side and can see both of them perfectly. Who would have thought that 2-inches of screen size make such a difference. I never once thought my old one was small, but this is positively mind-bending. Perhaps I was right all along and this <em>will</em> enable me to work outside the house more.</p>
<p>Perhaps more coffee shop adventures to come. I need to find a quieter place though.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Every so often I get stuck between a few bits of content I consume and suddenly an idea clicks. It might take a while to flesh it out, and work out if I haven’t got things backwards and just have some kind of frequency illusion of ideas. This one clicked straight away. Whilst listening to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-vergecast/id430333725?i=1000633582783">The Verge cast from last Friday,</a> I suddenly realised that Google and SEO could be ruining blogging.</p>
<p>That statement is a little hyperbolic, but bear with me here. For me to try to explain myself, I need to pull in from the various bloggers that seem to systematically have a cyclical but at the times the appearance of an existential criss. We all, <a href="/2023/04/17/trying-to-write.html">my self included</a>, <a href="https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/10/some-musings-on-how-to-write-more/">wonder why</a> we bother <a href="https://joelhooks.com/on-writing-more">writing any more</a>. That’s because we are told this activity is, <a href="https://comradeweb.com/blog/do-i-really-need-a-blog/">and should be</a>, winnable.</p>
<p>You too, can live off the income from adverts, be sent nice things for free and reach the top of Google if you just sacrifice these things. Write about these topics, or think this way, or SEO your words beyond recognition. That’s how you win blogging and get loads of clicks. When blogging doesn’t need winning, it only leads to a sense of <a href="https://getmatter.com/email/34369715/?token=34369715%3AruhSSCftwzHjx9WvCOVxmkx9Gvs">why bother putting this out into the world</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/703bcb8809.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I understand that the idea that every post you publish needs to have a utility to the world is ridiculous. Whilst at the same time, by stopping and looking around online at the content farms and self-professed “winners” it is also a completely understandable reaction to have. At times, I feel like my blog has to look and function a certain way, so I can somehow be “of use” to the rest of the web. When in reality no one searches my posts, no one clicks the pagination, and that’s absolutely fine.</p>
<p>This isn’t another don’t do it for others, do it for yourself post - there are enough of them online. It’s a realisation that one of the backbones of the web, Google search ranking, and to a certain extent, social media, has ruined so much of it. There are a huge number of people still blogging and not giving a damn, but many more that don’t bother because of these feelings.</p>
<p>Perhaps we are edging our way back towards a better social web that encourages blogging more, or perhaps this is just wishful thinking. One thing I am certain of is that a lot of blogging has been ruined already, and it will take a concerted effort from us all to build it back up again.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Think way back to 2016. The X-Files <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files_(season_10)">came back after 14 years</a>, a 4-inch lock of John Lennon&rsquo;s hair sold for $35,000 and there was a baby born with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/27/worlds-first-baby-born-using-dna-from-three-parents">DNA from three parents</a>. Weirdness all around, especially on the Apple campus. They were convinced the iPad was the future of computing, deep into “<a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-airs-new-ipad-pro-commercial-asks-whats-a-computer/" title="what is a computer">what’s a computer</a>” thinking yet still produced laptops with 3-year-old chips in them. Whilst everyone pointed towards a touchscreen Mac, they instead gave users a weird strip you could interact with and took away their function keys.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/39a423b65c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>You can theorise the motives for this for longer than the Touch Bar should have existed. It lasted for at least double its realistic life span and was finally killed at Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast-apples-keynote-event-shot-on-iphone/">Scary Fast event</a> last week. I bought one as soon as it was released, partly because I was desperate for an upgrade from my aging 2012 version, and partly because I was interested in where the Touch Bar would go. Convinced that Apple would turn this into a new interaction paradigm, and oh how wrong could I have been?</p>
<p>Looking back, I don’t think my confidence was completely unfounded. Apple has a history of being brave, this was the year of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12838024/apple-iphone-7-plus-headphone-jack-removal-courage">#courage</a> after all. Even more so when it <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/219603/apple-and-the-incredible-vanishing-cd-drive.html">came to computing,</a> and they usually got it right, or forced everyone else to concede. Whichever way it happened, my expectation was that the Touch Bar would become a selling point of the Mac. Unfortunately for Apple, they forgot that users who buy their ‘pro’ laptops, rely on the function keys — especially the doubled sized one marked escape.</p>
<p>The issue wasn’t that the Touch Bar was there, although questions of its utility dominated early reviews, it was that it now took multiple taps and more concentration to do simple tasks. Your use case may vary, but that was something I could put up with had the Touch Bar shown a real use case outside gimmicky scrubbing through timelines or swiping through photos. It felt half-baked at best, and thrown in to appease users demanding more from their Macs.</p>
<p>Some people believe this was to refresh the line before the real improvements of the M1 chip brought. However, hindsight is always 20/20. I think in reality, Apple saw this as a quick, easy fix to satiate those asking for touchscreens, as well as a perfect aid to the second generation butterfly keyboards. Unfortunately it appeared as a gimmick, got little to no support from Apple, and remained as a gimmick through its life span.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think it’s a shame that poor implementation ruined a semi-good idea. Apple clearly thought that this was going to catch on because the life span indicates so. My understanding is that production and lack of sales supported the entry-level MacBook having one for so long due to the cost of inventory. The design and production of the Touch Bar would make a great story, one we will continue to talk about for years to come. I can only dream of what would have been had they just put it above the function keys instead.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I got you with the clickbait headline. I mean it’s true, but as with most things, the real answer is: It depends. I read with excitement David Pierce&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/23/23928550/posse-posting-activitypub-standard-twitter-tumblr-mastodon">article on POSSE for The Verge,</a> as if it were some new technology to change the internet. The framing of the article aside, it is rare to see such excitement about boring indie web things <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23689570/activitypub-protocol-standard-social-network">like ActivityPub</a> from the tech media. It feels as if one of the founding ideas of the internet, that one&rsquo;s personal website should be the cornerstone, has returned like the proverbial prodigal son — and I love it!</p>
<p>This is a topic that is very close to my heart, one that has existed for decades but is gaining more traction since the demise of Twitter and the rise of X. I intentionally write about those two things as separate entities as I believe the start of one signalled the end of the other. David’s post is because of a wider spark and interest in the things that should have been building the web for a long time, as we escape from the web silos that have kept our content for themselves.</p>
<p>The idea is simple, it’s right there in the name, you Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. So everything that you want to post — whether it be an image, an article, a link, whatever — goes on <em>your</em> website. Whether you wish to call that a blog or not is up to you, but the salient fact is that you post it to a space you own. We could go deeper into the fact that you’re just renting space online from more gatekeepers, but I am not ready for that just yet.</p>
<p>In theory, this makes the most sense. You own all the content you put online, your <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/4480-2/">Twitter thread that should have been a blog post</a>, now <em>is</em> a blog post. Should the site you posted to go away, or you choose to leave, you still have the <em>thing</em> you posted. The problem is: The idea starts to break down when you consider that very few areas of the internet let you do this, and even if they do, it isn’t really correct and it&rsquo;s far too much work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Networks have different audiences, different people, different norms, different ways of engaging with the system. At some point, if you&rsquo;re just posting to a bunch of places all at once, aren&rsquo;t you basically spam? — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/23/23928550/posse-posting-activitypub-standard-twitter-tumblr-mastodon">David Pierce</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dave Winer wrote <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/23/220342.html">the initial response</a> I stumbled upon, who points out this fact articulately. There is an issue when POSSE is often synonymous with cross posting to different websites, and that relies on them all supporting the content you want to post in the same way. Should they do so (they don’t) you now need several accounts scattered across the web to do so, and frankly that is too much work.</p>
<h2 id="cross-posting-vs-activitypub">Cross Posting vs ActivityPub</h2>
<p>Since reading Dave’s post, <a href="/2023/11/03/posse-has-it.html" class="u-in-reply-to">numerous retorts have sprung up</a>, with good arguments for and against the ideas in POSSE — and a few missing the point entirely and ranting about something else. I agree, there are plenty of nuances here. As above, I think the idea is sound and makes perfect sense, I just think there is too much onus on the person to do the running around and manage the services. You can’t treat a social network like an RSS feed that people subscribe to. I guess you can, but that sucks a bit, doesn’t it.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/643de8aff5.jpg" alt="Posting to your blog and syndicating everywhere else "></p>
<p>Social media is, and should be, a two-way street. Yes, there are bots, and if you <em>are</em> intending your POSSE to be one, then be explicit about it, but you should really be managing replies and comments on everywhere you post. Otherwise, it feels like <a href="/2022/01/17/social-media-ghosting.html">social media ghosting</a>. As I wrote about in 2022, posting as if you are there, and then not checking in feels horrible. Micro.blog is still littered with people that put in their RSS feed years ago, so it appears as if they are posting, but they left a long time ago.</p>
<p>This is where ActivityPub gets it right. This isn’t cross posting, it’s consuming the same post in several places. The replies are the same, and it doesn’t matter where they come from. The post I write on my blog, syndicates everywhere, it isn’t cross posting. My blog post <em>is</em> the Mastodon post (or wherever else works with ActivityPub), not a facsimile of it that I never see. I don’t have to go and check everywhere else it appears, I don’t even need an account anywhere else. My blog post is all that’s needed, and that is how it should be.</p>
<p>Not everyone agrees, of course. <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">Manton Reece</a>, who David interviewed for his POSSE post and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-vergecast/id430333725?i=1000632256014">subsequent podcast,</a> thinks your posts should be able to be consumed everywhere. That’s simply because we don&rsquo;t live in an ideal world where everything supports ActivityPub. It remains to be seen if <a href="https://thenewstack.io/threads-adopting-activitypub-makes-sense-but-wont-be-easy/">Meta will actually bring it into Threads</a>. So cross posting is all we have. It just requires some thought, and I am not convinced everyone needs to cross post everywhere. Unless you live off the clicks, it’s far too much work.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Despite my outward appearance, I am a massive introvert. I do enjoy socialising sometimes, but I have to refill my battery often and that requires some peace and quiet. Something that is at times really hard to come by in my life. Like everyone, I have to work to earn a living, and then I have a family to look after. So I have to try to grab bits of it as a when I can. There is nothing I enjoy more than reading a good book once everyone has gone to sleep, or getting up really early in the morning and sitting outside with a coffee.</p>
<p>At the minute, I have a strange prickling in my brain. An annoying sensation that starts as soon as I try to grab a moment&rsquo;s peace. It is as if my mind cannot bear to be alone with its thoughts and as such has to distract itself as it looks to avoid it. This is the point where grabbing peace and maintaining it becomes the most important to me.</p>
<p>To feel my best, I have to force my brain to relax, to be alone with itself even more so than normal. I have <a href="/2022/07/27/210805.html">written before</a> about my tendency to always want to be on the move, and my failure to give myself enough of a break. Despite knowing this, and seeking a resolution for years, there is no peace in my brain. There are short periods of relief, where I put in some work towards helping myself, but these practices never become habit. There is too much life to cram into my time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a point where I <a href="https://www.ch3ngl0rd.com/staring-at-a-wall/">schedule in time to stare at a wall</a>, or detox myself from dopamine. I feel as if I can never attain true internal peace, despite how much I crave it. By accepting this, I would like to tell you that I have some resolution in my life, but alas I do not. No rest for the wicked, nor me.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/10/27/new-journalling-app.html"><h1 class="p-name">New Journalling App In iOS17.2</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>One of the big missing parts when <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> launched, at least for me, was Apple&rsquo;s new journalling app. It’s something that I have been doing for <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">the past few months</a>, and it has proved a real benefit in numerous areas. Although I’m a happy <a href="/2017/12/20/journaling-with-day.html">Day One subscriber</a>, having a free stock option is an excellent edition.</p>
<p>It was conspicuous by its absence, and although <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/13/new-ios-17-features-coming-later-this-year/">Apple eventually announced</a> it was coming “later this year” that didn’t really help. The app did not appear in any of the beta cycles nor the public iOS 17.1 release this week, but it <em>is</em> finally available for beta testers on 17.2. You can <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/journal/id6447391597">view the app on the App Store</a>, but not download it without the needed software.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8c3de6ee97.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re expecting a fully featured Day One rival, you will be disappointed at the moment. The app is very bare bones with a minimalistic interface. Which does make it straightforward to add an entry and scroll through the entries you have made, which is the whole point of a journal. Remember this is beta software after all.</p>
<p>When tapping the plus action button, you can choose between using AI-generated prompts to fuel your entry or to be greeted with a blank entry waiting for your thoughts. You can add in pictures, locations, and even voice notes, but there is a distinct lack of styling options. There is no way to add in subheadings, quotes, or anything other than basic text.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/42d0d2cc42.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you were expecting to be able to treat the Journal app as you would a regular journal and place in all manner of things, currently you will be disappointed. Wherever you decide to add in an image doesn’t matter because they automatically jump to the top of the page and display in a square grid. This simple oversight, which I must stress could be improved as the beta cycle goes on, will put many journal users off. A Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/s/syn45BdQxj">thread linking to the app</a> shares similar feeling towards the basic styling, lack of tagging or ability to have multiple journals.</p>
<p>With that said, I think this is a great addition to iOS. Most users stick to using stock apps and if by launching this app Apple can get more people journalling it is worth it. If and when users want more features they can go looking for ‘better’ apps, but the simple titled Journal app is a great, if restrictive, starting point.</p>

<p>There is that long-running joke that any social network is mostly made up of screenshots of all the other ones. This seems to be intended derisively. I see it as pretty excellent. It is a sign of a healthy web that these platforms are decreasingly insular, and that any of them is comprised of different pieces from elsewhere.</p></blockquote>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I wrote a post yesterday, not a particularly long one, but one that I felt, was important. It discussed the way I make notes from listening to podcasts and the improvements that practices has made to my life. In it were screenshots of the particular podcast in question, and I purposely didn’t publish it because of the creator of that show.</p>
<p>That weird, right. The fact that I do enjoy the podcast, but the host is a bit of a mine field due to his peculiar takes on things. No, it’s not Joe Rogan, but I think he is a typical example of this inability to separate people from the things they create. I don’t usually have an issue, I can watch Harry Potter films but think the views of J. K. Rowling are wrong. I can listen to Kanye West&rsquo;s music, and still be aware he’s a bit of an idiot.</p>
<p>However, this podcast host has said some things that have directly prodded at my emotional core, so my feelings feel different. I understand now why some people cannot do something I thought was simple and separate the creator because it has directly affected them. This is just a simple podcast, one that I still listen to because it good guests, many of which I haven’t come across anywhere else. So, in many ways I have separated the two things, but I would rather not be associated with their thoughts on some topics.</p>
<p>Much like listeners of Joe Rogan, there’s an association that if you consume the product, then you reflect the thoughts of the creator. There is a fear that others may think less of you, or you may suffer backlash because of these associations, and that is not something worth risking. Perhaps I will just change the screenshots and not worry about it.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I mean, everyone likes my blog posts, but one follow up that I got from publishing how I <a href="/2023/10/13/link-to-your.html">set up links to cross posting</a> is about the thumbs up. Some people are surprised you can ‘like’ my blog posts straight from the page, and I think it’s really cool too.</p>
<p>Technically, it’s called Kudos, and is the work of awesome developer <a href="https://vincentritter.com/?ts=tinylytics">Vincent Ritter</a>. His analytics platform, the aptly named <a href="https://tinylytics.app/">Tinylytics</a>, includes the ability to add a dopamine boating feedback mechanism right into your blog posts. I’ve made this the simple thumbs up emoji because I’m simple, however others have made it all sorts of things. See <a href="https://maique.eu/">Maique blog</a> and the lollipop icon. This achieves the same thing.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b32c691183.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Usually, the reserve of social media platforms, it’s actually quite nice to receive the occasional bit of feedback. A little nod to say people have read it and like it, rather than just bouncing off the page. I don’t think it should be the basis of why you publish to your blog, but thanks to Vincent’s work, it really helps. It is simple to set up, and you can try Tinylytics out for free at <a href="https://tinylytics.app/">Tinylytics.app</a>. I’m not affiliated with the service whatsoever, I just think it’s cool and people asked about it.</p>

      <p>Patrick Rhone, writing on For You about <a href="https://foryou.micro.blog/2023/10/04/you-can-choose.html">choosing how to feel</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don’t like what you find within, only you can change that. No one can make you happy. No one can make you unhappy. Only you can do that. No one can make you angry. You choose to react angrily. How you feel is a choice that you make.</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a tendency to dismiss someone talking about <em>your</em> feelings because “they don’t understand”. More so when a common reaction to depression is often “just cheer up” which is frankly a ridiculous statement. But I do think it is important to realise why you react or feel like you do and examine it closely.</p>
<p>The best tool I have at my disposal when I am having dark times is myself. To ask myself “what reason do you have to feel like this” and a surprising number of times there isn’t one. Even if there are reasons, more often than not some examination of what you are reacting to is enough to bring in some light.</p>
<p>Listen, there is no amount of thinking that can solve mental illness. However, there is a lot of personal responsibility to also bear, and that is typically hard to hear. You control your thoughts, feelings and how you display them. Even when the <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/the-piggyback-guy/">piggyback guy</a> is around, trust me, it works.</p>

      <p>At the end of Robert Rackley brief <a href="https://canneddragons.net/matter-podcasts-integration/">overview of Matter adding podcasts</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The FAQs for Matter’s new podcast feature are contained in a tweet (or whatever you call posts on X). What happened to actual product documentation? It’s not uncommon these days for software to gain features with little to no documentation that actually explains how to use them.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was always shocked when companies chose to host their product documents on Medium instead of their website, but this is a new low.</p>
<p>Having your guides and tutorials on a social media platform is bonkers. What happens when Elon decides you are. To log in to view. Or rate limits views. Or just deleted it ‘<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/20/23838823/twitter-x-deleted-pictures-links-2014-metadata-t-co-shortener">accidentally</a>’.</p>
<p>The manual on how to use your product, and how you communicate this to your users, should be as valuable as the product itself.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/10/02/mark-zuckerberg-on.html"><h1 class="p-name">Mark Zuckerberg on Threads &amp; ActivityPub</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I watched most of the interviews at and around <a href="https://www.vox.com/code-conference">the Code Conference</a>, which happened to be around the same time as Meta Connect this year. So my world has been filled full of decrypting what tech CEOs are <em>actually</em> saying. One of the stand-out stars is this open and frank conversation with The Verges Alex Heath and Mark Zuckerberg is well worth <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23889057/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ai-elon-musk-threads-quest-interview-decoder">a listen</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aCg7jH4S1w">watch</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve pulled out some quotes from the transcript I found interesting. I focussed on the first portion of the interview on Threads and ActivityPub because I don’t really have any interest in AI or Metas new products. However, I do care about their open protocol ambitions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an equally important part of designing any product is how it makes you feel, right? What&rsquo;s the kind of emotional charge of it, and how do you come away from that feeling?</p></blockquote>
<p>There was obviously some shade thrown here Elon and twitters way (I am still not calling it X). But there is a lot of truth in what he says about the way people use social networks is often dictated by the way they are designed. He goes on to say that “Twitter indexes very strongly on just being quite negative and critical” which is absolutely true. Not that the designers ever wanted to achieve this, but by leaning into fast-paced, post anything, get engagement from the whole user base, this is always where you end up. Something that gets worse with no work on curation and Elons ‘free speech’ nonsense.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how you seed the networks and the culture that you create there, I think ends up being pretty important for how they scale over time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark and Adam Moseri have the luxury of building a network from the start, bootstrapping it to one of the ones they already have for a user base, and then leaning on their ability to scale up. No other network in history has had this, and Twitter certainly did not have the luxury of creating a culture. Sure, Threads might be building while the plane is in the air, but Twitter is bailing out a sinking ship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a lot of people just don&rsquo;t want to use an app where they come away feeling bad all the time, right? I think that there&rsquo;s a certain set of people will either tolerate that because it&rsquo;s their job to get that access to information, or they&rsquo;re just warriors in that way. They want to be a part of that kind of intellectual combat.</p></blockquote>
<p>As someone who got a lot of value from Twitter for years, and then didn’t any more, I knew exactly what Mark was saying here. It always left me feeling bad about the world, and no amount of curation and blocking could fix it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even when the world is moving towards richer and richer forms of sharing and consumption, I think that text isn&rsquo;t going away, it&rsquo;s still going to be a big thing. But I think how people feel is really important.</p></blockquote>
<p>By all measures, text-based things should be dead by now. So many times have we been told voice first this, short form video that. Yet, text-based interaction just will not die.</p>
<h2 id="activitypub">ActivityPub</h2>
<p>There as a whole load of quotes about ActivityPub and Threads. Many of which cover the same ground, so I might not comment on them all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had our team at various times do the thought experiment of like all right, what would it take to move all of Facebook onto some kind of decentralized protocol? And it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s just not going to happen. There&rsquo;s so much functionality that is on Facebook that it&rsquo;s way too kind of complicated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting that Mark would at least claim to have thought about moving Facebook more open. His statement makes sense, but the constant closing down and siloing of information speaks for itself. I don’t think Mark is lying here, but words are easy to say.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>one of the interesting things that&rsquo;s evolving around this kind of the Twitter competitive space is a lot of the others. There is a real ecosystem around that and I think it&rsquo;s interesting.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>my view is that the more that there&rsquo;s interoperability between different services and the more content can flow, the better all the services can be.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually think that we&rsquo;ll benefit and we&rsquo;ll be able to build better quality products by our products, making sure that we can have access to all of the different content from wherever anyone is creating it.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think making it so they can use an alternative but can still interact with people on the network will make it so that that product also is more valuable. You can increase the quality of the product by making it so that you can give people access to all the content even if it wasn&rsquo;t created on that network itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is something encouraging about these statements, but they all feel a little too spun. I think there’s a shed load of advantages to Meta being able to point to ActivityPub interoperability, not least when questioned about timeline sorting and content moderation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>maybe for phase one of social networking, it was fine to have these systems that people felt a little more locked into.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of this funny counterintuitive thing where I just don&rsquo;t think that people like feeling locked into a system. So in a way, I actually think people will feel better about using our products if they know that they have the choice to leave.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is more about enticing people in whilst also letting them consume other&rsquo;s content than it is about users leaving and going elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in a way that actually makes people feel more confident investing in a system if they know that they have freedom over how they operate.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if we can build threads on this, then maybe we can over time, as the standards get more built out, it&rsquo;s possible that we can spread that to more of the stuff that we&rsquo;re doing.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think Meta see themselves as creating something that grows and expands on top of ActivityPub. I’ve said before that they would look to become the ‘blue bubble of new social media’, that offers more if you move to their Federated server – and then they can monetise your attention.</p>
<p>This whole conversation makes me feel more confident than ever that Threads will open up, but just a little. There are numerous moving parts, and they still do not really know where they stand with the EU and being outlined as a ‘<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_4328">gatekeeper</a>’. So it&rsquo;s a wait and see game, just don&rsquo;t hold your breath.</p>

<p>There’s a shared frustration that comes with these posts that is shared throughout my journaling and my photography. That is that my life is pretty mundane and built on load sod routines. My life is not one that social media would find very fascinating, and certainly is not all sunshine and rainbows.</p>
<p>This week, I have been preparing for my birthday and also numerous big projects coming up in my working life. Reflected by feeling as if this is the calm before the storm. I celebrate my 40th birthday (yes, I am <em>that</em> old) on Wednesday and before that, I have two days of kick off meetings. Oh, the joys! I hate my birthdays.</p>
<ul>
<li>Watched two games of the greatest team the world has ever seen (Arsenal), both with amazing atmospheres and great goals.</li>
<li>Celebrated my mother-in-law’s birthday with a visit of all the family to our house, which is where the photo above comes from. Too many kids to count and so much fun playing with their toys. Moments like this make me realise what a huge kid I still am at heart.</li>
<li>Ran just under 10 miles for the first time in a long time on Saturday. Meaning my weekly milage is slowly creeping up. The main issues I have is running more than 2 or 3 times in a week, at which point my body starts to tell me off. It is a struggle, but it&rsquo;s worth it for a great cause – donate to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024">London For Lucie</a>.</li>
<li>Received my iPhone 15 Pro max on Friday. I’ve gone up in size this time, and although I’m still not convinced, <a href="/2023/09/22/no-more-flat.html">the curved sides</a> and Titanium build make it much easier to handle. The zoom lens seems a bit meh, though.</li>
<li>I have been thinking a lot about blogging recently. Why someone would start and blog and the motivations to publish on the internet. A quote from Seth Godin stuck out to me, “ If you’re about to spend time and money and effort to create something, how will you know if it worked? What needs to happen to make it worth it?” The only external metrics you really have are clicks and responses, and it is up to you if you want to measure either of those things.</li>
<li>I managed to leave the sunroof of my brand-new car open last weekend, and, of course, it rained. There were some choice words muttered to myself, but it’s being repaired and should be back with me shortly. Mistakes happen, I guess, but the stress could have been avoided. I know how to make the sunroof shut when I lock the car now!</li>

      <p>Before myself and Nati recorded the first episode of <a href="https://toppodcast.com/podcast_feeds/bring-your-own-device/">bring your own device,</a> we made promises to each other. To be honest about everything. To be Apple fans, enjoy Apple devices but not be Apple apologists. To not be another voice in the sea of Apple bloggers that spent most of their time explaining why your opinions are wrong.</p>
<p>Sadly, the podcast no longer exists, but that idea that was core to everything we talked about stuck with me. I’ve never shied away from calling out mistakes from Apple, and <a href="/2017/10/25/not-being-a.html">tried very hard to not fall into fanboy traps</a>. This is an extremely long-winded way of setting up a way to say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l28UAs30Jjk&amp;t=101s">I was right</a> about the iPhone 12 design all along!</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c28e0726d5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I made a (feeble) video about the design almost as soon as I felt it because I was amazed at the massive step back. I read in amazement all the words that were then written to defend it. Claiming that it was a brilliant design, and perhaps I was “holding it wrong” (again). There is nothing wrong with opposing opinions, and some people seemed to genuinely like the update, so I did question myself a little.</p>
<p>However, the iPhone 15 smoothed out edges make me feel vindicated. Even more so when the same people telling everyone that the design was great, are now saying the iPhone 15 update is much better. There is absolutely no denying it. A combination of the curved edges, the titanium frame and the slightly slimmer bezels make the phone feel much smaller than it actually is.</p>
<p>I’ve gone up to the max this year with zero regrets now this phone actually fits in my hand! My pinky would like to formally thank Apple designers for thinking about the shape of human hands.</p>

<p>The frantic realisation that I hadn’t written my weekly post happened about 20 minutes ago. Not that anyone cares but with all the excitement of Apple announcements it completely slipped my mind. So excuse the two week update of what I’ve been up to. Weirdly mostly tech related.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordered the new iPhone 15 pro. This year I am moving up to the max because I’m old and want a bigger screen and this is now my only camera so I want the best one.</li>
<li>Skipped the watch updates. Nothing beats my current Ultra and a processor bump will not make me part with another £850.</li>
<li>Running just over 10k consistently now. My lungs are still and issue but mainly after my run. Please donate to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024">London for Lucie</a>.</li>
<li>Happy to have Matt Birchler on board with the stock <a href="https://youtu.be/7KMYKoDiIiU?si=hWB7S0-IsOaFVlsh">Apple podcast app</a>. Nothing works as well over several Apple devices and although it’s not perfect the iOS17 beta makes it even better.</li>
<li>My son may be disappearing to Spain for a week next year as part of a school event. Super proud of his dedication to his school work and being an awesome human being.</li>
<li>Everyone is back at work now and the house is quiet all week while I work from home. Almost makes me want to visit the office. Almost.</li>
<li>I bought and returned a Pixel fold last week. It’s just <a href="/2023/09/11/its-not-for.html">not for me</a> in the slightest. A poor phone and an even worse table rolled into on very nice but lacking device.</li>
<li>We have lots of hospital appointments coming up so this week will be a busy one. All of Lucie appointments come around at once and it always sucks. Hopefully I don’t forget to write stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>Continue to be awesome, and that’s an order but make sure you take it very easy my friends.</p>
<p>🤙</p>

      <p>There is nothing more polarising in the social media circles I travel in than iPhone announcement day. It brings out the worst in people from both sides, particularly the rampant consumerism and fanboy gloating. However, the thing that annoys me most is the snark that also appears.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with a casual ribbing. Might I suggest that fact that it took Apple 5 years to implement USB-C? Or that Apple claims things like 5x zoom is cutting-edge technology? Choose these things, and you might even find a fanboy to argue back with you for internet points. Though, I’d much rather you let people enjoy what they like and get on with it.</p>
<p>This isn’t restricted to tech, but it seems to bring out the worst tribalism in people. Whenever England are playing football, you see hundreds of posts similar to “yay sportsball”. Obviously, with less tactful word choice. In the same way, people can enjoy watching an Apple event without being a blinded consumerist sheep. They can also enjoy a game of national football without being a hooligan.</p>
<p>The fact that I even need to explain this to people makes me a little sad. Even more so, that I almost wrote a blog post explaining why I am buying a new phone. Undoubtedly, there are people that overstretch themselves to upgrade when they really don’t need to. Marketing and perceived societal pressure can influence some silly choices. The idea of making people more aware that they don’t need to upgrade is important. However, the holier than thou attitude isn’t.</p>
<p>We all enjoy weird and wonderful things in our life. I certainly have some things that others think are odd, but it brings me joy, and that shouldn’t matter to anyone else. I’m a big believer in loving what you love, and <a href="/2021/06/12/hate-what-you.html">hating what you hate</a>, but you don’t need to press those things on anyone else. Be constructive, not destructive.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I read a recent <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/i-tried-to-use-apples-calendar-app-but-i-ran-back-to-fantastical/">post by Matt Birchler</a> talking about his experiment with going back to Apple’s stock calendar. It sparked in me thoughts about my recent switch (well a few months ago) and I thought I would share my experiences. Not that my lowly blog needs to lend credence to the amazing Matt Birchler, but it is often helpful to see more than one person pointing to the same things.</p>
<p>With that said, Matt and I have very similar jobs. One full of meetings, team catch-ups and projects to complete. I am sure he also has a fair share of family things to keep up with too, and I have all sorts of appointments and meeting for <a href="/2022/08/03/lucie-loves-her.html">my daughter</a> to contend with. So the benefits felt by perhaps one side of life for some people very much bleed into every part of mine.</p>
<p>For me, my calendar is my entire life and <a href="/2019/11/20/how-i-use.html">has been for some time</a>. When people turn their noses up at a subscription for “just a calendar app” I do understand. However, I get so much value from Fantastical, it is money I gladly hand over. You see, I <em>could</em> (and have) get by with the stock app, but I’m much better off with Fantastical. You might ask why, and that’s why you’re reading this post, so let me try to break it down for you without being too repetitive.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/22a9c87b11.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="meetings-and-integrations">Meetings And Integrations</h2>
<p>The pandemic accelerated my already increasing number of virtual meetings. Something I don’t really mind because I’d rather be working from home than traveling all over the place. For some reason, every company seems to use a different method for these, so I have to meet with SEO experts on Google meet, internal conversations on Teams and then move to chatting with event organisers on Zoom. Fantastical makes this a breeze. I don’t need to install loads of apps all over the place, just sign in with all of my accounts and click the join meeting button in my calendar.</p>
<p>Fantastical also integrates with my task manager of choice, Todoist, as well as my Office 365 work calendar, my shared iCloud calendar with my wife and even Meet Up for some sudo socialising! By having everything in one place, I can see all of my tasks scattered across the various platforms all in one full list. Not many apps allow numerous services to be integrated and work together as if they were all in the same place. This works on mobile too by selecting tasks in the top left menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8f102193a5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="time-boxing">Time Boxing</h2>
<p>Which leads me to my next major feeling point for Fantastical, time boxing is life changing. I first noticed this with Josh Ginter <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/fantasticals-duplicate-as-event-has-changed-my-time-blocking-routine/">writing about this for Sweet Set Up</a>, and it was the thing that inspired me to go all in on a better calendar app. As you can see from my screenshots, I block out time in my calendar to complete certain types of tasks all at once. Placing DND into areas that I don’t want to be disturbed – but I can do that in any calendar app Greg, I hear you say. Indeed, you can, but the customised colours and <a href="https://flexibits.com/blog/2021/01/getting-started-with-templates/">templates you can set up</a> make this easy to set up and understand with a glance.</p>
<p>This is where two things come into play and make time boxing effortless for me when using Fantastical. I can look at the upcoming weeks calendar and already all tasks with due dates are present. I can then begin to plan around them, blocking out my day to make sure I know how much spare time I have and what kind of tasks will dominate those days. Pressing CMD + R brings up a list of all the tasks I have outstanding, and I can simply drag these into the places that I have blocked out. For example, above are periods where I have blocked out designing time, and in this 4–5 hours I can get several design focused tasks completed.</p>
<p>Granted, I understand that these things might not make a difference to you. To be honest, there was a long time when I thought they didn’t for me, and now I couldn’t be without it. Fantastical saves me more than the cost of the subscription in time and effort, but I understand it is not for everyone.</p>

      <p>I love to try new things. To push the limits of where I am settled and see if new technology can help me out. This usually revolves around phones and for a long time I was, a phrase I coined, a phonehobo. I just moved around all over the place and never had a home. The constant release of Android phones in the early 2010s meant that there was no shortage of new things to try and the constant promise of the new one being the best.</p>
<p>Now I am settled into using iOS devices, I know that the Workflows I have built up and the apps I enjoy using are right for me. That doesn’t, however, stop me trying things out even so often, and if you’ve followed me for more than five minutes you will have seen my occasional dalliance with Android phones. Most of these dalliances are to make sure I don’t fall into the trap of being a fanboy, and can appreciate that different, and at times better, things exist.</p>
<p>Each time I decide to try one, I have the same ideas in my head. That the device will offer me a bit more than my trusty iPhone, and a return of the excited feeling I got every time I unboxed a new Nexus or Galaxy device in the distant past. Yet, a day or so into using them, I rediscover that Android is just not for me.</p>
<p>I like Android. I think it’s a great OS, and each update that Google release makes me wish I could use it. There are no issues with the hardware either, bar the camera, many of the handsets I try match Apple build quality and some are even better. There’s not <em>one</em> big reason why I always go back, there are just lots of little paper cuts that make the decision for me. Small things that I can’t get used to or just don’t work the way I want them to, and no amount of me forcing the issue will change that.</p>
<p>There are numerous things in life that are not for me. Mechanical keyboards. Red wine sauce. Anime movies. I just need to accept that Android is another one of those things. There is a comfort in being comfortable with yourself, maybe I should give that a try!</p>

      <p>I take loads of notes. Like a serious amount, that at some points it seems a bit unhealthy. I enjoy writing everything down for later use, and over the years it has proven invaluable numerous times. I like the process of doing it, I like to remember things, so I read them back, and I use them in personal and work related projects on a daily basis. This isn’t a post to polish my ego or anything. ”oh look at me, the perfect little notetaker” – it just sets the scene so to speak.</p>
<p>There are a few times that this habit has sucked the joy out of activities. It <a href="/2023/01/15/i-tried-to.html">ruined podcasts</a> for a little while, for instance, but I soon worked out my workflow and what I wanted to achieve. As I wrote about in my linked post above, there is a tendency in the modern world to want to hack everything. To squeeze and shape all the things in your life to get the most out of it. There’s a time to be efficient and proactive, but not with the things you enjoy. Those things are to slow down and enjoy the most.</p>
<p>There’s a benefit to subscribing to services like <a href="https://www.blinkist.com">Blinkest</a> and cramming in all the information you can get your hands on. There is also. Time to slow down, flip through the pages of a good back and enjoy the moment. Some people get immense benefit from listening to audiobooks or podcasts at 2x speed, and then there are other <a href="/2019/04/29/skipping-silence.html">that enjoy the pauses</a> and <a href="/2021/03/14/the-importance-of.html">the silence</a>, and want to dwell on the words.</p>
<p>I am in the camp of slowness. Of savouring what you enjoy, or benefiting from the things you do the most. I write things down in a <a href="/2023/05/17/get-a-notebook.html">notebook</a>, with a pencil! I don’t need to hack my brain with a Personal Knowledge Management system because I just write things down, and I read them. Likewise, I go over some of the things that I read and listen to (not all of them) for nothing more than to enjoy them again and remember the things they say.</p>
<p>I value the people that rush around and hack all the things, but this not me, and I am totally at peace with that. One is not better than the other, they are just two sides of the same story that is modern life.</p>

      <p>You know that horrible experience when you first buy a car, and then you see loads of the same one coming in the opposite direction all the time. It’s a known human cognitive bias, the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon, I know it’s false, but I am experiencing it with vertical things at the minute and I can’t work out where it is going.</p>
<p>It started on Saturday when I was running (donate to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024">London For Lucie</a> by the way!) and listening to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/1/23855476/today-on-the-vergecast-happy-techtember-everybody">The Vergecast</a>. In which they were talking about all video apps being the same, just consuming each other’s ideas and increasing the length of vertical video viewable in apps. Which is interesting considering, as they point out, a service like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quibi">Quibi</a>, despite it terrible name, might not have been the worst idea ever. An idea explored in <a href="https://wondery.com/shows/the-big-flop/episode/13847-quibi-bites-the-dust-with-connor-ratliff-amp-matt-bellassai/">episode 1 of The Big Flop</a>. Smartphone users really like vertical videos, and it feels much more natural.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b17e17aed9.jpg" alt="" title="Image from Kapwig"></p>
<p>This started a flash back to weird marketing events I have been to where people have discussed vertical video and very much switched off (I hate those type of events). I began to wonder just how much do people prefer watching vertical videos because it does make a lot of sense for many situations, but everything bar the smartphone sticks to horizontal. Of course, you can find stats <a href="https://www.animaker.com/blog/vertical-video-facebook-ads-case-study/">all</a> <a href="https://www.aarki.com/blog/driving-higher-engagement-with-vertical-video">over</a> <a href="https://www.impactplus.com/blog/vertical-video-in-marketing-infographic">the</a> <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/vertical-video/">place</a>, but turns out – it’s a lot.</p>
<p>Still seems odd to me outside of quick scrolling social media, but I’m not one to argue with the stats and considering how old I am, my opinions could just be the old guy shouting at the clouds again. It just made me think back to a few years ago when any person filming vertical video would have been chastised. Now it is not only the norm, but it is expected. This also got me questioning many things.</p>
<p>There’s new <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/lifestyle-tvs/the-sero/">TV’s with vertical modes</a>, <a href="https://ergomounts.co.uk/product/infinity-series-vertical-tv-floor-stand/">floor stands to make yours do it</a>, and all sorts of products pushing vertical monitors. It seems absurd at first, but when you stop and think about it, it makes a lot of sense. I’m a bit stuck with a reason on actual TVs, but websites, apps and almost any user interface I come across has the majority of its elements in a vertical stack. This got me thinking about my work, mainly being in web UI and Print design (which is nearly all vertical). I had side eyed the oddly shaped LG DualUp when it was first launched, thinking it made sense at the time – so I bought one.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/74088e7469.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It was relatively cheap in the world on monitors, and comes with a really nice ergonomic arm, so I feel like I got a good deal. However, as soon as I placed it down on my desk (well, clamped it to it) I felt conflicted. As much as the size and orientation makes sense, it just feels strange. That all went away when using it, though. The build quality, screen resolution and portrait set up means I am over the moon with it. Why on earth I didn’t pull the rigger before I will never know, maybe I have been indoctrinated by the previous landscape based world. However, now I am free!</p>

      <p>Charles Chen discussing he’s outlook that <a href="https://chrlschn.medium.com/mastodon-is-rewinding-the-clock-on-social-media-in-a-good-way-8998f6d9f1aa">Mastodon is Rewinding the Clock on Social Media</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the consume side, that means that your home feed has no Algorithm (big-A “Algorithm”). This can be disorienting at first when coming from X and FB. Practically, it means that you see only what you want to see and only see it linearly. You never wonder, “why am I seeing this and how do I make it go away?”.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am completely convinced that users both want algorithmic timelines, but they need one. There is some research to back this up <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-just-proved-people-hate-chronological-feeds/#:~:text=When%20they%20scrolled%20through%20their,such%20as%20YouTube%20and%20TikTok.">from Meta</a>, but others found <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-people-want-social-media-feeds-ordered">the opposite</a>, so take from that what you will. However, in my opinion, it is only tech nerds that shout the loudest because we feel as if we need to complete our timeline as if it is a video game. When, in fact, users want to follow loads of people but only be shown the good stuff from their circles.</p>
<p>The biggest reason users complain is when companies don&rsquo;t get it right, and not many companies have managed that. No one wants a chronological feed on TikTok or Netflix, and that&rsquo;s because the algorithm is complete seamless. Using your consumption data to get the right things in your face at the right time.</p>
<p>Granted, you could argue this is because they are not ad networks and are not bothered about showing you them. They do, however, need to keep you engaged, and watching things. So they ensure their suggestions are as good as they possibly can be. We’ve all had the odd bad experience on these platforms, but there’s no scrambling for a long list of the latest things launched.</p>
<p>Could you imagine if both of these platforms got it as wrong as Twitter does?</p>

<p>I have just realised that between <a href="/2023/08/28/week.html">last week&rsquo;s update</a> and this one I only wrote, one blog post. I am certain that some weeks have been even worse, but seeing it so easily makes me want to get my ass into gear and publish more. Perhaps you will see more before next week&rsquo;s post? Don’t hold your breath!</p>
<ul>
<li>If I can be allowed to start at the end of the week and work backwards, I watched Arsenal destroy Man United yesterday and there are not many better feelings than this. Watching it with my brother-in-law who is a United fan made it even sweeter.</li>
<li>Yesterday I deleted my Instagram account. It became too much of a time suck and fed my ego to a point where I took a break for a week or so. This finally made me realise how little I need it in my life, and <a href="/2023/09/03/logged-in-to.html">the final straw</a> was on checking in on Thread I wasn’t allowed to disable my account again for a week. So, instead, it has been deleted – don’t look for me there.</li>
<li>This week was my best week for a long time running. I racked up 35 miles all told. I realise this isn’t a long way, but it is a gigantic boost to me, and my lungs are starting to feel much better. I have months of training to go, but I am starting to believe I can do it. Donate to London for Lucie <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024">here</a>.</li>
<li>I took delivery of a new monitor for my home working office. It is the <a href="https://www.lg.com/uk/monitors/ergo-monitors/28mq780-b/">LG DualUp – which</a> is taking some getting used to. The monitor itself is portrait rather than landscape and has great reviews online. I work mostly in print work, and websites, both of which are portrait, so this should work better than a wider monitor or another one on the side.</li>
<li>Someone is working very hard this week to break into my Facebook account. I mean, I don’t even really have one apart from a blank shell to manage my business pages, but I get 3-4 password reset emails a day. It’s fun.</li>
<li>We also attended a friend&rsquo;s christening, which was really fun. Meeting with our group of friends and spending time laughing and joking was great. Lucie thoroughly enjoyed walking around because she knows everyone and believe me, everyone knows her!</li>
</ul>
<p>I would rather not mention my flip phone adventures, it is for another time, so you will have to stay tuned. I will always be here and pretty much nowhere else now. Take care of yourselves, have a wonderful week.</p>
<p>🤙</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Matt Birchler on <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/let-the-internet-run-out/">letting the internet run out</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a world where we all struggle with how much we use our devices (let’s be real, we mean our phones), I think it’s kinda nice to have some places that just give up and tell us, “my dude, you’ve read it all, go do something else.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I read this and nodded along, like most posts Matt publishes because it’s easy to agree with things you know to be true. It wasn’t until a few days later when that I realised just how prevalent, and desired, the endless feed is.</p>
<p>The loudest voices are often ones that scream for chronological timelines, but the reality is most users don’t want that. They want to be endlessly distracted at any moment. Both companies and the majority of users would like to have a constant stream of entertainment, there’s no reason to have an end really is there. An end of the feed would mean the user leaves, opens another app and continues to mindlessly scroll. That’s not good for the bottom line now, is it?</p>
<p>Like Matt, I too love an app that comes to an end. Sure, it might be frustrating when I need some entertainment, but it gives me pause to think if that is really what I want to be doing. Occasionally, that answer is yes, and there’s no shortage of places to go on the internet, but more often than not the answer is no. Even a small little pause <a href="https://one-sec.app/#:~:text=It%27s%20as%20simple%20as%20effective,makes%20distracting%20apps%20less%20appealing.">causes most people to think about what they are doing</a> and close the app. Hitting the end of the feed doesn’t always feel like a good thing, but it always is.</p>

<p>This is where the iPad is today. It’s good enough for what it does. If it doesn’t do it, it doesn’t do it.

<p>I am sure he will forgive me, but I always read <a href="https://maique.eu/2023/08/28/thingsthisweek.html">thingsThisWeek</a> by Maique and like the idea of small updates of the things I have been up to. So without further fuss, here’s mine.</p>
<p>This week was ups and downs as usual. Filled full of some working and some days off due to bank holidays and skilfully timed annual leave. I spent a lot of it trying to relax, failing, and also trying to <a href="/2023/08/19/trying-to-get.html">run a little more</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yesterday we went to meet another little girl with the same genetic condition as Lucie. It’s wonderful to think that something so rare, about 50 people have it worldwide, can affect two little girls just down the road from each other.</li>
<li>I have been a bit slack on some of my important routines over the summer holidays. For example, journalling and meditating. I discovered I can <a href="https://todoist.com/integrations/apps/habit-tracker">track habits in Todoist</a> so set this up for a few essential ones with reminders. It is working well.</li>
<li>On the Todoist front, I have been leaning on more digital tools recently. I wrote about my <a href="/2023/08/26/notebooks-in-summer.html">summer issues with carrying a notebook</a>, but even with digital tools I have tried to bring over good analogue habits.</li>
<li>This week, I have spent some time thinking about what I want my blog to be and working on some theme updates. With this in mind, I have set up <a href="https://tinylytics.app/">tinylytics</a>, the excellent service from <a href="https://vincentritter.com/?ts=gr36">Vincent</a>, just for the ‘like’ button. You will notice an improved comment and reply section below.</li>
<li>My running is going slightly better this week than last. I’ve been slowly plodding around some miles. I still feel like I might have to give up at any moment, but the great charity I am doing it for keeps me going. I’d love it if you would donate <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024">here</a>.</li>
<li>Had to take a bit of a break from all social media after American politics reared its ugly head again. It seems to have calmed down a bit again, so I’m checking in every so often – but mostly publishing without visiting anything.</li>
<li>I’ve got plenty of thoughts about my <a href="/2023/08/23/my-big-flip.html">use of a flip hone again</a>. I need to get around to writing these up, but every time I try it becomes really preachy, and I would rather not publish that. Safe to say my mind feels a bit better, but I have relented and wearing my Apple Watch again. I’m not certain how, but it still gives me Todoist notifications and the like, but it’s mainly for tracking runs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you all have a great week this week, and you know where I am if you need me. 🤙</p>

      <p>After months of carrying around my notebook constantly. Through thick and thin, whatever the occasion. Do you know what killed it? Summer. My field notes and everyday inspiration cover doesn’t really fit with my baggy summer shorts, and that kind of sucks.</p>
<p>Months on end, this thing stuck with me. Containing all my notes, thoughts, blog post ideas and most importantly all the things I have to do. Now it’s just on my desk at work and comes out every now and again if I have a meeting. Perhaps I am going to have to change my wardrobe for next year.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. It doesn’t care. Unlike all the apps on my phone, it’s not pinging and prodding me to pick it up if I put it doesn’t for more than 5 minutes. I just feel bad for not experiencing all the positives it had brought me. I won’t go into them here, but it’s safe to say a notebook is the biggest improvement I made in my life for a long time.</p>
<p>I do find it a bit silly that something as silly as a slightly bulging pocket ruins it. So I’m trying to make a concerted effort to get back into the habit. The summer weather in the UK has been a bit crap this year, so I will probably be back in jeans by next week.</p>

      <p>I’ve always liked the idea of a digital garden, even tried to set one up a few times, but never really managed to make one stick. Well, perhaps that’s not strictly true, I do have one in Apple notes, but it’s not a published one.</p>
<p>The appeal comes from my note-taking itself. I write them obsessively, about anything and everything. They evolve all the time. Get overwritten, rewritten and added too as much as new ones sprout up, and that is perhaps what I would like my blog to be.</p>
<p>Blog posts are often seen as rigid things. An unmoving line in the dirt of what we think and the things we believe in. Whereas, much like my note-taking, the thoughts, and motivations for them evolve and change. They age just like the rest of our thoughts. The things we write and publish online should not be thought of as rigid things. Instead of being pushed out to the world at one point, they should be allowed to change over time.</p>
<p>This style of note-taking is typically referred to as Evergreen notes by those that like to tend their online digital gardens. They fluctuate far more than your traditional blog posts, and can offer much more in return. Blog posts, however, are the opposite. Deciduous, if you will. Sure, you <em>can</em> go back and update blog posts or link to new ones, but they are typically just left to stagnate. Left as a reflection of one point in time. Barely revisited. Wilting away. Which kind of makes me sad.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’m not sure what has caused this feeling. <a href="/2020/08/09/i-cant-go.html" title="2021-04-16  3:26 pm">These motivations</a> have existed <a href="/2021/12/08/putting-in-some.html">for a while</a>, but <a href="/2021/04/16/back-as-far.html">never quite reached</a> this level of motivation, my desire to ditch my phone has reached the levels I have never experienced before, and I’ve gone and done it. For the next 4 weeks, at least, I will be back to using a flip phone, so I figured I might as well get some blog posts (and entertainment) out of it while I navigate this weirdness.</p>
<p>A week or so ago, I was doing the yearly practice of <a href="/2023/08/15/its-that-time.html">trying to work out when</a> the new iPhone should come out, and when the best time to sell my current version would be. It’s a fine line between having to use a backup phone for a while and getting the most for a device that will drop in price the closer to the iPhone event we get. I usually go back to using my trusty first generation iPhone SE for a week or so, and by the end of it I am ready to throw it in the bin. This year, my SE has not risen from the ashes, and so I’ve opted for something more radical.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/38056de2d4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Listen, I’ve been banging on about hating my phone but needing to use it for ages, but never done anything drastic before. I’m uncertain if it is because <a href="/2023/08/23/currently-reading-stolen.html" title="5:21 pm">I’m reading Stolen Focus by Johann Hart</a> presently, or I’m just getting my yearly internet annoyance period. Whatever the motivation for it is, my SIM card is now in a Nokia 2660 Flip phone that cost me a whole £25. Well, actually two of them are, my work phone and my personal number because this phone is Dual sim (and that’s about the only useful thing about it).</p>
<p>In the first few hours, I’ve already had a panic because I couldn’t check how much money was in my bank account before I made a purchase. I’ve also been teased relentlessly by my wife and son for daring to take a call in public on it, but I think I am getting there. I will no doubt hit numerous road blocks along the way, and might end up stomping into town to buy a cheap iPhone, but it will be amusing for everyone to watch (or read about) anyway.</p>

      <p>As most people will already be aware, I’m <a href="/2023/08/02/london-for-lucie.html">running the London Marathon</a> to raise funds for the Epilepsy Society. A charity very close to my heart. Although the run isn’t until April 2024, I need to start ramping up my running in preparation and unfortunately, this is proving more difficult than I thought.</p>
<p>In December 2021, I got my third COVID-19 vaccine, the so-called winter booster. This started one of the biggest issues I’ve had to overcome in my life because it threw my life into chaos. I’d not experienced any side effects to the other two shots, but immediately following this one I didn’t feel myself and still don’t. After a few weeks of suffering, I discovered I had issues with my heart and lungs, leaving me unable to even walk very far without feeling out of breath.</p>
<p>This was devastating to me. I’ve always been active, <a href="/2021/03/09/i-did-it.html">raising money for charity</a> and running was <a href="/2021/02/15/why-do-i.html">one of my favourite</a> things to do. The inability to do much affected my mental health and my family, and that still continues to this day. Although I am much better than I have been, running and placing too much stress on my system has been frustrating.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/acfb82c727.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I thought that these issues were starting to wear off, but as soon as I’ve tried to run again, doing anything but a mild pace results in my lungs hating me for days afterwards. So I’m trying to take this really slow and steady, but I think the pace I used to run at is ingrained in my legs.</p>
<p>I’m aiming to run the 26.2 miles in around 4:30, which is slow but a pace achievable for me. This is a little over 10 minute miles or 6:23 kilometres. My plan was to start off at this pace and increase my mileage very slowly over time. Yet, trying to slow myself down for my bodies sake, takes too much concentration at the minute. Any time I try to switch off and enjoy the run, my legs start speeding up again!</p>
<div class="london box">
<h2>Donate to London For Lucie</h2></a>
</div>
<p>Within a few minutes, I realise I’m going too fast because my lungs are telling me off and I have to slow down again. It’s a ridiculous problem to have, and one that results in me running around a minute per km too fast. This has also put some stress on my body that I didn’t want, and my breathing is suffering at the minute. There is no question about me keeping going, but I may have underestimated the effort needed. As well, as its effects on the rest of my life.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/08/11/back-to-regular.html"><h1 class="p-name">Back To Regular Old RSS</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Like Cobra Kai, the life cycle of talking about Really Simple Syndication feeds never dies. Since reaching 2.0 thanks to the development group that included Aaron Swartz, RSS has become one of the backbones of the internet. Web silos can try all they like to shut it down and control everything, but it continues to deliver everything from your favourite podcasts to the best websites directly to your proverbial door.</p>
<p>Despite being a massive proponent of RSS, I have been fighting with it for a while. Using other services seemingly built on top of it to suite me better, but nothing beats simply subscribing to your favourite feeds in a simple app of your choice. I am back to doing exactly that because of issues, bugs and perhaps web silos – I simply can’t find anything better.</p>
<p>Listen. Matter has given it a good go and <a href="/2022/12/14/matter-my-most.html">I thoroughly enjoy using it</a>. So much so that I paid for a <a href="/2023/05/15/received-some-gifts.html">Patron subscription</a>, including three years of access and priority support. Building several shortcuts and reading workflows to share highlights to my blog and annotate interesting articles. Since before <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/nucleus">their own 2.0 version</a>, I’ve been using it to subscribe to much of the web through RSS and delivering newsletters to it. However, it just doesn’t cut it any more.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9fa45b5b0e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>See the screenshots above, I am subscribed to <a href="https://birchtree.me">Matt Birchler’s blog</a> feed in both Matter and Reeder 5. These should be the same, yet there’s a stark difference with what is available for me to read. Despite flagging feeds all the time because I know there are posts missing, nothing ever changes. I realise that Matter does numerous fancy things by parsing all the web content etc, but this is more of a realisation that regular old RSS is best.</p>
<p>In a search to find a replacement, I went on a tour of all the services I could find or came recommended. Many built on top of RSS. Some offered seemingly extortionate ‘Pro’ subscriptions for finding new RSS feeds for you (yet only sticking to well-known websites). Even more of them offered me some kind of assistant to summarise the articles for me. Among all the investigation, I discovered something different – like my note-taking, <a href="/2023/03/03/the-simplest-path.html">the simplest path</a> is the best.</p>
<p>If you want to build some fancy second brain and map your thoughts, or write notes until your fingers are numb, there’s a service out there for you. Yet, the two decade old idea of just subscribing to the RSS feed is often the way to go.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Typically, I enjoy peace and quiet more than anything else. By far, my favourite time is after everyone is fast asleep, and I can enjoy the dullness of the world. I am not aware of any sensory processing issues with my brain, I just don’t understand why everyday life has to be an assault on my senses, and I’d give anything to quieten it down. Thankfully, it only cost me £249.</p>
<p>I’ve theorised that this might be due to the world needing to constantly try to sell me something. I hate the needless background music in gyms, but it seems to spread everywhere. So much so that I have taken to wearing AirPods a lot of the time just to tune some of it out.</p>
<p>Noisy telephone conversations in coffee shops, dull background rumbling of vending machines, wherever it is, all I need to do is pop in my AirPods, and it all goes away. Despite this feeling like I’m mad at the world, this post is more to express my love of my AirPods and why.</p>
<p>These tiny white bits of genius (obviously other noise-cancelling headphones are available) are my favourite bit of technology I own. Not only do they help with quietening down the world, they also improve me hearing the things that matter. Apple has done a wonderful job of transparency mode when you need to hear the things going on around you, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2023/06/airpods-redefine-the-personal-audio-experience/">Adaptive Audio</a> is a wonderful improvement.</p>
<p>There’s still the unshakable feeling that I am being rude by wearing my headphones, but I think the world is getting used to it. If teenagers can get away with it, so can I!</p>

      <p>I am no stranger to writing about my life. My <a href="/2022/07/17/ninja-warrior.html">son</a> and <a href="/2022/08/30/the-world-is.html">daughter</a> often feature in blog posts, and sometimes podcasts! We have lots of struggles and I use my blog both an outlet and also a way to publicise this. One of our biggest struggles is with Lucie’s <a href="/2020/01/31/the-diagnosis-relief.html">various disabilities</a> but in particular her Epilepsy.</p>
<p>I also love raising money for charity through various crazy things, such as running <a href="/2021/03/09/i-did-it.html">4 miles every 4 hours for 48hours!</a> So this week two things in my life collided, and I entered the London Marathon to raise money for a charity very close to my heart, the <a href="https://epilepsysociety.org.uk/">Epilepsy Society</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2024/3810c55850.jpg" width="50%" height="auto" alt="">
<p>Epilepsy stops Lucie from doing so many things in here life that it’s at times upsetting. She suffers daily seizures, and we’ve been through numerous investigations and tests to try to get to the bottom of them. All of which are really hard for Lucie to deal with, but she does it all with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>The way she deals with everything and still manages to light up so many people’s lives made it an easy decision to take on this challenge. I have been trying and failing to enter the London Marathon for years, but that doesn’t change the fact that it will be a huge challenge for me. It will cost me months of training and a lot of pain, so I’m asking for a favour in return as a reader and a friend.</p>
<div class="callout" style="margin:20px 0px;">
<h2>Donate To London For Lucie</h2></a></div>
<p>I’ve set myself an ambitions target of £3000, and I need your help. I know times are rough and the cost of living is higher than ever, but if you can so spare just a couple of £/$/€ I will be forever grateful. If you enjoy my writing, posting, podcast, whatever it may be (and even if you don&rsquo;t), <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024">please donate</a> whatever amount you can to make a difference in people&rsquo;s lives.</p>

However, <em>for me</em> photography is more about the process of taking the images and the things it says to me than the perfect outcome.</p>
<p>The fact that phone cameras can take such amazing pictures now is brilliant, but the standard experience, at least on the iPhone, needs work.</p>

      <p>I hate this feeling. I’ve never had it before, and I never want it again. Some people call it the holiday blues, others feel it every week on a Sunday evening. Whatever you call it, I’m talking about that sinking feeling when you realise you have to go back to work following some time off, and it fills you with dread.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, I enjoy my job. I have an excellent employer and a good working environment, not many people can say that. I don’t dislike my job by any stretch, but I just don’t want to go back to normality just yet. I want to stay in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvKD3tNAV36/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">my holiday bubble</a> and live a life of sun, sea sand and little to no worries. Unfortunately, life doesn’t work like that.</p>
<p>I know in my rational mind that returning to normal is what makes vacationing and time off work so special, but my heart has different ideas. I know that I will return to an ever-growing task list, <a href="/2023/01/30/there-will-always.html">there will always be more work</a>, and a wave of things that happened on my time away. Even though I was a bit sad, and answered emails while I was away!</p>
<p>My enjoyment of my working environment and the things I do has been replaced by the stress of managing a team with a gigantic workload. Thankfully, once the initial few days are out the way, things will return to normal, I am just not sure if I want this normal any more. It could be midlife, it could be holiday blues, either way I have to shake it off and get going anyway!</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For a lot of the last 18 months or so, I have had two blogs. Since <a href="/2021/11/05/a-new-home.html">buying a new domain in 2021</a> I found my approach to writing became too formal. I spent too much time worrying about publishing and soon returned to a micro.blog at gr36.com. I would then publish personal notes, short things and whatever I wanted, but soon discovered it wasn’t the domain that made me lose my way, it was me.</p>
<p>Each time I made a concerted effort to write and publish more, I started to move further away from what I want my blog to be. It has to be about me. It needs to revolve around my thoughts about topics and, more importantly, be about what I get up to. I am sorry to say that over the last few months I haven’t been doing that. I’ve fallen into the trap of writing rather than blogging. Although my posts are littered with personal writing errors, they are still more about being a brand than being myself.</p>
<p>My blog feels more like a website than a personal representation of myself. More so than ever before, I want the web to return to pockets of people posting things about them, and to push for that I need to do it myself. My blog is my place to not just publish my blog posts, buy my photos, my updates, and everything else that would typically be on ‘social media’ – becuase that is precisely what it is.</p>
<p>A <em>personal</em> place to post.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When rumours started to appear that Meta, of all companies, were working on an ActivityPub based social network, I was sceptical. I’m a massive fan of the protocol since retreating to <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> as my only social interaction in the middle of last year. Meta putting its stamp on some IndieWeb underpinnings could mean so much for networks such as Mastodon, and could mean that social media companies were finally being more open.</p>
<p>This is just something companies say. Marketing spin to ride on the coat tails of the hype surrounding the influx of Mastodon users, and wouldn’t actually be the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754304/instagram-meta-twitter-competitor-threads-activitypub">case come launch day</a>. If Meta really wanted to do something like this, surely they would put it into established apps like Instagram first. It was a confusing proposition to have this huge ad company, used to locking everything down and maximising eyeball time, adopt anything open. I didn’t buy it.</p>
<p>Months later, <a href="/2023/07/09/my-lukewarm-take.html">Threads appears</a> in a rush, following a few weeks of drama on some Mastodon servers calling for de-federation. Surprise, surprise, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/adam-mosseri-says-metas-threads-app-wont-have-activitypub-support-at-launch/">no ActivityPub support</a> – but Meta does seem <a href="https://help.instagram.com/169559812696339">invested in implementation</a>. There are still some doubts, that have grown following Threads mass adoption, but the conversation by Casey Newton and Instagrams head Adam Mosseri on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/podcasts/special-episode-metas-twitter-rival-arrives-with-adam-mosseri.html">Hard Fork</a> convinces me that ActivityPub is in their near future.</p>
<p>By making it easy to follow other ActivityPub accounts, they not only open the service up to more users and more content. They also make it easer to move elsewhere. That’s a huge advantage to someone like me who plans to retreat to his <a href="">ActivityPub blog</a> once all the fuss is over, but also for every other user. Don’t like the way Threads is run, get tired of the algorithm thirst trap, or just want to expand your brand further? That&rsquo;s easy with ActivityPub. You can move to a different server and <em>still</em> access all the content being posted on Threads.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/daf438108d.jpg" alt="Image from Private Internet Access " title="Image from Private Internet Access  "></p>
<p>I am not naive enough to think this is for completely altruistic purposes. The cynic in me can point to numerous advantages to Meta for seeming to embrace an open standard. Account portability means that any negative press or possible legal action over algorithmic feeds and so-called shadow-banning can be combatted with the fact users can move. There&rsquo;s no argument against ‘de-platforming’ someone, as ActivityPub makes it easy to pack up your account and leave.</p>
<p>Meta also has the opportunity to turn Threads into what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/7/23787093/on-the-vergecast-its-threads-all-the-way-down">The Verge referred to as the blue bubble of ActivityPub</a>. You can build on top of the standard, allowing your specific service to have extra features, but also syndicate everywhere else. Making Threads more attractive to people seeking those features, perhaps such as deep integration with Instagram, but not being restrictive. The downside of this, of course, is that you can only show ads to <em>your</em> users, but that might mean Meta has to work on providing a platform people want.</p>
<p>Whatever the motivation behind ActivityPub, it doesn’t negate the fact that openness is solving big issues for social media platforms. ActivityPub&rsquo;s integration is best for both parties and solves massive issues, and does it well. Being able to move your content from platform to platform is the dream of an open web, and if that works out best for indie blogs and social media corporations at the same time, that&rsquo;s great for everyone.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Meta rushed out its Twitter competitor come rip off due to the current rate limit disaster going on over there, and everyone rushed to try it out. The combination of a vast number of people using it, increased moderation efforts and hype around ActivityPub integration met in a perfect storm of interest that meant tens of millions of users flooded in. I was one of them that jumped on the Zuck bandwagon, and I’ve got some conflicting thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="initial-impressions">Initial Impressions</h2>
<p>I downloaded that app when it was launched. In fact, I was that sad I pre-ordered the app a couple of days before. Not because I was excited, but I was pretty intrigued to try it out, as I do with most new apps with significant hype around it. I don’t really want to get involved with a Twitter replacement, but I enjoy kicking the tyres on most things just to see what they offer.</p>
<p>Only a matter of minutes after porting <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_greg_morris/">my Instagram account</a> data into Threads, I was deactivating it and deleting the apps. The homescreen was filled with clout chasing ‘influencers’ spouting all kind of drivel that <a href="/2023/07/06/sign-into-threads.html">really wasn’t what I needed</a> in my life at this point. I had escaped one hell site that I was moderately addicted to, and just the thought of using Threads gave me horrible flashbacks. For a few hours, anyway. I read some posts, listened to some thoughts and a few messages exchanged with other people using Threads, I logged back in again.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2914c98528.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In my haste to get away from the service, I had unwittingly <a href="/2023/07/06/fyi-you-cant.html">deactivated my Instagram account too.</a> Meta are unable to untie the two once you’ve signed up (something they claim to be <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/07/delete-your-threads-account/">working on a fix</a> for). So, I am actually thankful I logged in again. This time around I followed a few more people and began to realise the benefits of the service. Don’t get me wrong, the thirst trap algorithms are still turned up to 11, and I hate it, but there is a benefit to having many people you want to follow in one place. Threads mixes my worlds together with Photographers from Instagram, tech people that never Twitter and also friends that never ‘got’ Twitter but were pushed toward Threads from Instagram.</p>
<h2 id="half-baked">Half Baked</h2>
<p>Reporting suggests that Threads was rushed out at least a couple of weeks before it was ready, and even at that point I think it would have been an MVP. Meta has thought about the important things such as muting and blocking, but the edges of the service are more than a little rough. Including the inability to attach photos without the app crashing. Something initially blamed on iOS17 betas, but is also plaguing Android users.</p>
<p>It is hard to know if the terrible experience on the main feed is to combat a lack of content and users (usually referred to as a cold start). I hope that it will be turned down once the user base is high enough. However, it is quintessentially Instagram in the sense that it shows you people you follow first and then quickly ramps up the influencers posts. The app takes on the annoying approach of showing you a glimpse of an interesting post that then disappears once the app loads, never to be seen of again.</p>
<p>Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri says that a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/06/threads-feed-of-people-you-follow/">chronological feed is “on the list”</a> but how long that list is who knows. Given the app&rsquo;s tendency to not only crash but log you out in the process, and the lack of any web app, I would say that list is pretty long.</p>
<h2 id="will-i-use-it">Will I Use It?</h2>
<p>I absolutely hate this idea that platforms are only as valuable as the traffic they provide but it is true most of the time. Users flocked to Twitter because it was the place to be, provided up-to-the-minute news, and for publishers it provided access like never before. All of a sudden, you could see what people were up to, and at the same time drive traffic to whatever it was that you were producing. Rapidly working its way into journalists&rsquo; lives, as well as publishers bottom lines.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4d84bad5b2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The same could be said about Instagram. It provides access to even more people of note, albeit through an airbrushed and filtered lens. Users can show off their best life, showcase their work and influence the purchasing decisions of more than a billion people. What Meta are really good at is recognising this and maximising the results in their favour. They don’t care what you post, only that you are posting and consuming as much as possible. It is social media manipulation in the most obvious sense – and I hate that.</p>
<p>Threads is also a pretty nice place to be. If you can mentally filter out all the noise, that hopefully will die down in a few days. Currently it feels as if we have all realised that Twitter was wrong on so many levels and want Threads to be a nicer place to be. I have no doubt that tools, dunking on people and attention seeking will come, but Instagram have promised that their moderation efforts are aimed to make Threads a pleasant place to be. However, Meta doesn&rsquo;t exactly have the best track record and may already be <a href="https://www.them.us/story/threads-moderation-nudity-lgbtq-users">hitting issues</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I am conflicted. I know in my heart of hearts that using a product by Meta is the worst social media decision. Even if it appears that Meta is the better of two evils, it is still evil and nothing can change my mind on that given their history. However, I am actually enjoying being able to interact with more people again. I am catching up with people that I haven’t followed for a very long time, and that is great. I see myself diving in a little until Threads <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/adam-mosseri-says-metas-threads-app-wont-have-activitypub-support-at-launch/">introduces ActivityPub</a> – at which point I will probably divert everything back to my blog.</p>
<p>I am excited for a time when I can take part in the discussions happening on Threads, but not have to use the service or their terrible app. Let’s hope this doesn’t take too long but I have a feeling it might not be this year.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>One of the biggest complaints I had at the time I chose to <a href="/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html">remove the iPad from my workflow</a> was the constantly changing nature of it. Each time Apple updated the OS they slightly changed, or completely revamped, the way multitasking and other things worked. When you use and rely on something as much as I did my iPad, it gets frustrating quickly. Unfortunately, they have now done it to the Apple Watch, and I’m pulling out what little hair I have.</p>
<p>I am aware it beta software, so everything <strong>could</strong> change, but watchOS 10 changes the core functionality so much that I doubt it will all of a sudden roll back these changes. This isn’t uncommon for Apple either, way back in 2017, I was frustrated at the <a href="/2017/12/05/what-does-a.html">inconsistency on what a swipe does</a> on different iPhones. Now it is my muscle memory that has been forged by many years of having these things strapped to my wrist.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/de570fbb6b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I don’t even dislike the update, a lot of it makes sense, it’s more of the jarring UX change. I keep swiping up from the bottom of the screen, something I have done thousands of times to access Control Center, and it now shows me widgets. Widgets that, excuse me for being an old man shouting at clouds for a moment, I have absolutely no need of!</p>
<p>I <a href="/2015/05/17/i-like-this.html">fell in love with the Apple Watch</a>, much like I did the iPad because it was simple. It did exactly what I required. Told the time and gave me the health tracking needed. Now I just feel a little out of touch, as if it is watchOS 1 and Apple thinks I am going to send my heartbeat to other people again. I hope that watch OS doesn’t suffer the same fate as iPad OS and forget exactly what it is, and how simple it should be.</p>
<p>Accessing the dock of apps is now double press the crown, and turning it also accesses the aforementioned widgets. I like change, I love change for a reason, but this feels like change for change’s sake. The new animations do look nice though!</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/07/04/apple-notes-is.html"><h1 class="p-name">Apple Notes Is Just About Perfect in iOS17</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It is pushing on for a year since I <a href="/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html">wrote about my all in use of Apple notes</a>. That was about a year into my journey that started with numerous moving backwards and forwards in note apps, and ended with the realisation that the app that was built ring into my phone was the best one. It was the one I used the most, the one I relied on, and the one that delivered the most consistent experience. With iOS 17, the app is just about perfect for my use, and I bet that would be the case for most people.</p>
<p>Listen, I love my <a href="/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html">notebooks</a>, I carry them everywhere and love writing in them – but nothing beats digital notes for surfacing things. My Field notes is my inbox of sorts, it contains all the mess and fleeting things that come to mind (as well as all my scribbles). My enjoyment of them is purely tactile, and I fully understand that digital notes can be far more useful to keep, so I exist in this wonderful word of writing notes and then typing the important things into Apple Notes.</p>
<p>I digress slightly, but I guess this gives you a good understanding of where the thoughts contained in the post come from. I have never been convinced that Apple notes was ‘perfect’, it was just the best option for me and most people. It lacked some simple things such as block quotes, and even making links on iOS was overly complicated, but iOS17 solves most of these little faults, and now it’s mostly perfect.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/efe904a390.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The biggest update to Apple Notes is linking between notes easily, and it’s not an exaggeration to say Apple absolutely nailed the implementation. You can tap link and just type out the name of the note you want to link to, there&rsquo;s no double bracket or back linking bandwagon joining, it’s simple, elegant and exactly what is needed. You’re not going to start a full PKM with Apple notes, but I would make the argument if you really need to anyway.</p>
<p>Couple this with improvements to not only the styling options (hurray for block quotes) and also the easy you can do these, makes Apple Notes a serious note app for almost everyone. I had started writing most of my notes into Bear Notes until updating to the iOS17 beta and seeing most of my issues solved. It doesn’t have as many customisation and export options, but most of this can be solved with Shortcuts if that&rsquo;s your thing.</p>
<p>After about 3 weeks of use, the app is fast, fluid and provides one of the best stock notes apps I have seen. I&rsquo;m as shocked as you are that Apple actually cares about its apps, once iOS17 comes out you should try it out.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’ve started reading Jason Sinek book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780241958230">Start With Why</a> and like most books of this ilk it’s tough getting through all the repetitive cherry peaked examples and struggles to get to the point. It suffers from the modern problem of a book that could and should have been a blog post.</p>
<p>The idea it covers do help with loss of things though. It talks through the importance of communicating why you do something or why you have created the things you do, first. It does this in a very business centric way, it’s a business book after all, but it also applies to everything you want to do, even if you are communicating it just to yourself. Something I started thinking about it after watching a <a href="https://youtu.be/inPnvN6PyLg?t=126">Maurice Moves video</a> a few months ago.</p>
<p>In it, he discusses the things he writes in his notebook and a few tips about productivity – sounds like my kind of video doesn’t it! However, it is very different from most others about this subject. He plans everything in his notebook, including his desires and motivations, and by writing these out he gains a new perspective.</p>
<p>By being clear about the ‘why’ of what he wants to achieve, he quite often finds that the ‘what’, or the results, he would like to achieve is not always what he defines at the start. Sound confusing, let’s look at his example.</p>
<p>He started his YouTube channel, wishing to get to 1 million subscribers. When asking himself why he wanted this goal, it was so he could monetise his videos well and earn enough money for this to become his ‘job’. By clearly defining the ‘what’ and validating this through asking ‘why’ he discovered that the perceived result of wanting subscribers, is actually a symptom of the actual desired result. The actually desired result was creating enough revenue to live from, which has nothing to do with channel earnings, it is merely a symptom.</p>
<p>As Alan De Botton puts it “it’s bad enough not getting what you want, but it’s even worse getting to the end and realising it isn’t what you wanted all along”. Don’t fall into this trap and start asking why, to <strong>everything</strong>.</p>

<p>Honestly, I find the same. Every time I think about trying WordPress it seems to get further and further away from a blogging platform. The interface is bloated and overly complicated. I am sure it works for a huge number of people, but simplicity is not one of its strong points.</p>
<p>Plus that editor 🤮</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It has taken me decades on this earth to realise that I need to spend more time processing the trauma that I experienced. No one did anything bad to me or anything, but I think everyone has this period when growing up where you realise that life in the real-world hurts quite a bit. It&rsquo;s a natural progression, and the worst thing you can do is run away from it.</p>
<p>This isn’t a sob story, but the fact is my parents were not very nice to me. One left when I was a baby, and I have seen a handful of times since. The other may as well have left because they threw themselves into working and ‘providing’ that the distance between us was insurmountable. I was effectively raised by my Grandparents, particularly my grandfather, and both of them are no longer with us.</p>
<p>I think everyone has some kind of tale to tell about their childhood. You can come from the nicest, most caring family in the world, but you will have something that stands out in those myriad of great experiences that shaped you into the person you became. The people who deal with it the best are the ones that face it, deal with it and move on – I did no such thing. I self-medicated.</p>
<p>Not in the literal sense. The masking of these sots of issues can come in many forms, and inebriating yourself is only one of them – if admittedly and very popular one. If you look at the currently emerging generation, they are choosing to hide away from the world and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/21/opinion/teen-youth-focus-group.html">live out as much of it online instead</a>. To Self medicate their worries and fears by hiding behind anonymity and block lists with the goal, as Freddie deBoer <a href="https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/you-are-you-we-live-here-this-is">put it</a>, to live out in infancy forever.</p>
<p>I decided to self-medicate myself with busyness instead. To constantly be working on something and make sure I spend as little time as possible with myself. If worrying about doing something was an olympic sport, I would be up there with the best. I couldn’t sit still, I had to be something and to prove to everyone, and me, that I <em>was</em> good. If my parents weren&rsquo;t concerned about my enough to show me love, how could I love myself?</p>
<p>This all sounds very hyperbolic, doesn’t it. That I’ve blown everything over the top and the adolescent search for attention. That could be true, if it were not for the fact that I didn’t realise this until decades later. In fact, only in the last few months have I processed all of these feelings, prompted by the remarkable book <a href="/2023/03/03/finished-reading-four.html">Four Thousand Weeks</a> by Oliver burke. There are so many things to take away from this book, but the part discussing work by psychotherapist <a href="https://www.stephaniebrownphd.com">Stephanie Brown,</a> who had a practice in Silicon Valley in the 90s, hit me hard.</p>
<p>Her researched showed me that I was not alone in feeling the restlessness that constantly bubbled away deep inside me. These feelings are a form of self-medication and indicated I was doing everything I could to not feel something else. Not being able to sit still, rest or enjoy a basic activity is a defence mechanism against being alone with myself. In the same way a drug addict may be distancing themselves from the world by impairing themselves to deal with difficult emotions, I was doing the same with tasks. I enjoyed being busy so much because my brain was afraid of what would happen when I stopped.</p>
<p>The constant hustle got me absolutely nowhere. Even though I have achieved plenty of things, I didn&rsquo;t become a millionaire. All I got was obsessions bordering on neuroticism. Thankfully, I learnt to deal with difficult things and became aware of my mind hiding things from me. Learning more about myself and becoming a better person in the process.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/06/15/apples-vision-of.html"><h1 class="p-name">Apple&#39;s Vision Of Our Apocalypse</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When I sat down to watch this year&rsquo;s WWDC, Yes I am that sad it’s a bit of an event I sat down to specifically watch, I was already expecting the worst. Very few details had leaked about exciting updates to iOS or macOS, but there were leaks aplenty about the upcoming headset. I don’t like <a href="/2016/10/10/please-dont-put.html">computers on peoples faces</a>, and Apple did nothing to persuade me otherwise.</p>
<p>What it did do is create a buzz around VR again, and make sure that Apple <a href="/2023/05/06/the-apple-vr.html">didn’t miss the boat</a>. Both technologically and conceptually, the Vision Pro is already a success for Apple. I have no doubt that the device, even one that <em>starts</em> at $3,500, will be amazingly built. Containing numerous advancements and more than one breakthrough technologies. Yet in my heart of heart, I am conflicted by this device.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/90c66f9207.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The overly airbrushed demos showed a world that simply doesn’t exist. Without mentioning that most of the videos appeared to be CGI, the concept Apple tried to create missed entirely. Whilst I expected the Vision Pro to be marketed heavily to creatives, the ability to interact with a massive screen anywhere you like is appealing, I didn&rsquo;t expect the Black Mirroresque dystopian predictions. The vision of eyes displayed on a screen, so people know you can see them, genuinely made me shudder.</p>
<p>At the same time, I was also blown away by the device. The same dread filled eyes are a hint that Apple has thought about users being in a world of their own, and also the wider issue of people around you knowing they can be seen. This is Apple business 101, wait and see where a market leads to and then produce a device with its users in mind. Once it goes on sale, there will be no questions about the way the device works or that it delivers on the promises made.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of my worry comes from the rousing blog posts and YouTube videos crowing about how good it will be. There&rsquo;s far too much tech bro web3 weirdness going on for my liking. Anyone that expresses concern or, god forbid, thinks the whole thing is a bit silly, is met with “you just don’t get it” type replies. I do get it, I thoroughly understand the device, the promise of spacial computing, I just weep a little for the world it <em>might</em> create.</p>
<p>I say might because I am just not convinced that the world conforms to Apple&rsquo;s make believe world. I’ve never done half of what Apple seems to think people do with their devices, and I can&rsquo;t see a world where people put massive goggles on to watch a film, at home, alone. Sure, it gives you a much more immersive experience where you can drown out everything around you, but is that <em>really</em> what is missing from our lives. Perhaps it is, and I am just an old man shouting at the clouds.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6489cb8e29.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The thing about my strange melancholic feelings about the Vision Pro is the unshakeable feeling that maybe I am wrong. Perhaps people will strap something on their face to watch films, or record the world around them, or entertain themselves on a plane journey – and I am just a bit sad about that. Charlie Warzel summed this up perfectly when talking about the Vision Pro being the perfect device for the Apocalypse. He wrote “a future in which people with enough disposable income can retreat from the physical world into the gated-face community of a 360-degree iPhone screen” and it scared me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no preaching here. I use my devices to death, despite <a href="/2020/08/09/i-cant-go.html">my desire not too</a>, so I am not on the outside looking in. More on the inside looking out, desiring a simpler world with less intrusion and distraction but accepting that the world is not mine to mould. I could see the advantage of something like Google Glass, that overlayed information onto your world. Perhaps even Snapchat Glasses or Facebooks Ray-bans for being device free. To a certain point, I can also see the benefits of the Vision Pro for some demos Apple used, such as working on a large screen in the office, but the rest of it is just weird.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ebf56e5ccb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>For the first time in a long time, we are introduced to a new computing world. I genuinely understand the excitement that I see in the tech world around me. I get it. You are not wrong to feel that way. I just think it&rsquo;s been over sold and there will be many people who feel some very strange emotions after buying this device, and not just from the motion sickness.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/06/14/what-is-an.html"><h1 class="p-name">What Is An App</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>In modern times we have grown to rely on them, but starting with the first device to run them we’ve had a strange relationship to apps. No more so in the world of iOS, that for many years clung so rigidly it the ‘tap square, open app’ mentality that every single facet was sandboxed away from the other. A strange way to deal with things given that our whole lives are now on smart devices. Perhaps with iOS17, we are finally seeing what applications should have been from the start.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. Apple’s approach was the best approach when devices were tiny, underpowered in both processing and battery departments, devices that were more of a novelty. In a world where <a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world#:~:text=How%20Many%20People%20Have%20Smartphones%20In%20The%20World%3F&amp;text=According%20to%20Statista%2C%20in%202023,world%27s%20population%20owns%20a%20smartphone.">6.92 billion people</a> rely on a smartphone, it starts to get a little silly. Why doesn’t my calendar app talk to my to-do app? Why doesn’t my sometimes smart voice assistant add content to my app of choice without vocal gymnastics? It&rsquo;s time to reconsider what an app is?</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2a7bcb1350.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The latest iteration of iOS, version 17, scheduled to roll out to users in September, introduces interactive widgets. A large advancement on the idea that apps shouldn’t just exist behind squares on your homescreen. Or app library, or whatever it’s called this update. You should, in fact, be able to interact with the features of an app outside the confines Apple usually places on them – it is almost as if they get it now.</p>
<p>Once I choose to install an app on my device, it should be able to interact with my device in whatever way I see fit. My device shouldn’t be set up to work with some apps better than others, or dictate to me what apps I have to have on my phone. If I ask Siri to remind me of a task, it should put that task in whatever app I want it to. Instead of jumping through all the linguistic hoops I have to currently. Anyone who has asked a simple command like “Remind me to call John tomorrow at 5pm in Todoist” knows that no-one in their right mind pronounces it Tod-oh-ist.</p>
<p>Apple, and any smart device maker for that matter, needs to stop forcing things on me that I don’t want and listen to what I do want. Perhaps I want to use <a href="/2022/12/31/manual-practices-to.html">Todoist</a> as my reminders app, <a href="/2019/12/03/i-keep-coming.html">Bear</a> as my notes app, and WhatsApp as my text and video call app. iOS should get out of my way and allow me to do so, with the relevant checks for privacy and data access, of course. What’s the point in taking all of these wonderful applications that I can install on my phone and hiding them away behind an icon, an app should be part of my phone and the way I use it.</p>

<p>The Vision Pro may be merely an expensive gadget and a gimmick, but it represents a rationale that feels almost comically ill-suited to our moment: an invitation to narrow our collective aperture at a moment that asks us to bear witness and that demands our clear, unblinking gaze.</p></blockquote>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/06/06/notes-and-reminders.html"><h1 class="p-name">Notes And Reminders Improvements in iOS17</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It seems like the WWDC keynote was only yesterday. Well, it was, but I’ve been playing with iOS17 ever since, and found numerous little things that were not spoken about in the keynote, so I thought I’d point them out here. Also, I need to sleep now.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Listen, <a href="/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html">I love Apple notes</a>, but there are a few things that are lacking to make it great. Unfortunately, Apple never seemed interested in its stock apps until the last few updates, and Notes once again gets quite a few teaks in iOS17.</p>
<p>They spoke about PDFs and improvements to mark up, but Apple Notes also features the ability to link notes together. It’s not quite the double square bracket easy linking that modern notes apps seem to love, but it helps bring some PKM style linking to the best notes app on your iPhone.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/480d42ee3a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Also improved is the ease of selecting styling options, with everything available under a floating add button. I’d like to see adding a link available here too because using the text selection options is a little awkward, but at least things like indenting and font styling are easier to get to. There’s even less reason to <a href="/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html">use anything else</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d8b343bf0b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="reminders">Reminders</h2>
<p>Apple mentioned interactive widgets on iPadOS17, and thankfully they are also in iOS17. The Reminders one shown piqued my interest to see if there were any other improvements, and thankfully there are. Reminders has always lacked that little something to really snatch usage away from to do apps, but this might tip a few over the edge.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/37bf74c909.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The stock Reminders app now features the ability to add in sections to your lists and also manage them in a Kanban style. Of course, they never call it that, but the ‘columns’ layout found behind the three dots reveals the same functionality. The ease of adding and editing columns needs some work, but this style of to do management could remove a lot of reliance on third-party apps.</p>
<p>Once again, the iOS update is nothing revolutionary, it introduced lots of little updates that will improve usage. I keep stumbling upon little tweaks that should really help me, so I will keep posting them – follow me through activity pub <a href="http://micro.blog/gr36?remote_follow=1">greg@gr36.com</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For quite a while, I’ve had this feeling that my <a href="/2023/05/10/my-adventures-with.html">system of writing notes</a> in my <a href="/2023/03/12/what-is-my.html">notebook</a> was needless. That I was writing too many things down, and generally speaking, I didn’t refer to them. Which meant that my practice was a waste of time and energy. That was until I experienced someone else looking for something they had written down only a few weeks ago, and I instantly felt better about my system.</p>
<p>Once I heard the words “what app was I using then” I knew the chance of finding that information had drastically reduced. This is not a post about belittling anyone, it’s more about my realisation that too much complexity ruins everything. Multiple blogs, apps, and anything else where there is a question on where to put ‘it’ means you’ll have a harder time finding it when you need it.</p>
<p>I always opt for <a href="/2023/03/03/the-simplest-path.html">the simplest path</a>. The one that stores everything in one place and removes as much cognitive energy as possible. We’ve all had to turn the house upside-down trying to find something you kept safe, but you can&rsquo;t remember where, and the same is true for information you want to retrieve. It doesn’t matter if it’s a digital thing, or a physical thing, if you don’t know where you put it, you stand much less chance of finding it.</p>
<p>This way isn’t easy. There&rsquo;s always a new fancy app launched, with a whole heap of <em>paid</em> influencers telling you how great it is (until they move to the next one next week). There are always questions about digital calendars, notebook, apps and everything other place your stuff can be stored. <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/pages/about">Ryder Carroll</a>, the person behind Bullet Journaling, says “the more apps, the more apps” and this simple mantra should be your guiding light.</p>
<p>The more complexity you introduce, the more questions need to be asked at the time of storage, which leads to less chance of it being useful in the future. The more thinking you need to do, the more chance you’ll either not bother or never find it again. Whatever it is you are trying to save will fall through the gaps, never to be seen again.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Nilay Patel <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23712602/google-search-25-years-anniversary-ai-artificial-intelligence">for The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in an information ecosystem whose design is dominated by the needs of the Google Search machine — a robot whose beneficent gaze can create entire industries just as easily as its cool indifference can destroy them. </p></blockquote>
<p>This is exactly correct. Every website must conform to their standards, bow to their non-disclosed algorithm changes. Google not so much shapes the web, more smashes it into its image.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All those bold subheadings in the middle of articles asking random questions? That’s how Google answers those questions on the search results page.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Searching the web for information is an increasingly user-hostile experience, an arbitrage racket run by search-optimised content sharks running an ever-changing series of monetisation hustles with no regard for anything but collecting the most pennies at the biggest scale.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is why literally any other way to search the web reliably will explode. Everyone knows that a Google search is littered with SEO spam, but there is no other option and I feel as if they push towards LLM led search is a response to this.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Ever since the pandemic hit in early 2020, I&rsquo;ve mostly been enjoying the comfort of working from home. Of course, there have been a few weeks here and there when I had other commitments that required me to be elsewhere. But at least 3 out of 5 days, you can find me tucked away in my cozy spare bedroom, diligently working away. Working from home has brought me incredible benefits like improved focus, work-life balance, and so much more. However, as my professional journey progresses, I find myself having to spread my time between home and office life, and it can be a little annoying.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, my job itself isn&rsquo;t the annoying part. It&rsquo;s the fact that I have the opportunity to tap into the benefits of both working situations, but figuring out how to make the most of it can be a bit of a challenge. Let&rsquo;s face it, working from home (WFH) is an absolute game-changer for many of us — I&rsquo;m a huge fan. It allows me to work longer, deeper and better without the distractions of a traditional office setting. But, there&rsquo;s no denying the wonderful perks of being around other people.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/52740b6b13.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I have begun to appreciate the value of bouncing ideas off my colleagues, engaging in vibrant conversations, and simply having that positive energy that comes from working side by side with others. That&rsquo;s why most days, you&rsquo;ll find me popping into the office for a quick meeting or a planning session before heading back home. Lucky for me, my office is only a couple of miles away from home, but it&rsquo;s still a tad inconvenient.</p>
<p>I have a desk at work and another one at home, which means I&rsquo;m stuck with two keyboards, two monitors, and all the other gadgets I&rsquo;d rather not drag around. It also means that neither place feels like the perfect fit for me. While I do enjoy some of the advantages of both working environments to a certain extent, it&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;m constantly on the go, working from different spots all the time. Maybe the solution lies in finding a balance by splitting my time and establishing clear boundaries. Honestly, I have no idea how flexible workers manage it, but I&rsquo;m open to suggestions!</p>

      <p>Every so often I see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13q8jzz/you_meet_your_13_year_old_self_but_can_only_tell/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=15">posts</a>, usually on Reddit, that say something similar to “what would you tell your 15-year-old self” and I always think through the same things. There have been times in my life that I’d rather had avoided. Terrible, painful times that have left emotional and physical scars on myself. However, as an ever showing optimist, it was all worth it to get here.</p>
<p>I could tell myself to not play in that football game that ended my career. Or avoid that relationship that ruined me for a few years. Life events that you would rather not go through always come to mind, but as with every time travelling film teaches us, small events lead to more significant changes. There could be some gains to be made, but if there is any risk of me not getting to meet my wife and have my wonderful kids, for me, it isn’t worth the risk.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/25721f7d02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Friedrich Nietzsche proposed a thought experiment based on <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/nietzsches-idea-of-the-eternal-recurrence-2670659">Eternal Recurrence</a>. A demon comes to you at night and says the life you are living is just a cycle. One you will carry on reliving over and over again, exactly the same. All the pain, all the joy. Everything, as it was, forever. Would this change your outlook on life? Would you look at this as a gift or a curse?</p>
<p>Greater than this though. Whenever you experience painful times, would you look on them better, knowing that they all lead to a point that made you happy. That in those darkest hours when you felt like the world was ending, there was always light at the end. Your newly opened eyes would treat these life events with a more Stoic approach. An acceptance that these bad times need to be bared to get to the good times.</p>
<p>Then this demon is not required to change your way of thinking because this reality is already true. Through all darkness, there comes light, not matter hoe small. Although we are not destined to repeat our lives over and over again (that we know of) the same thoughts are true.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>In my tendency to over simplify things, I <a href="/2023/05/17/get-a-notebook.html">wrote a post</a> about how to maximise your productivity. There are no apps involved, just <a href="/2023/03/12/what-is-my.html">a notebook</a> and something to write with. No fanciness, no expensive things, just a tried and tested method of keeping everything with you – the problem is: How on earth do you put it to use?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a practice that is rife in productivity, it keeps people busy and keeps whole companies in business, it’s called <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/">the collectors&rsquo; fallacy</a>. The logic that saving some things can be helpful, so more must be better. With the only issue being you are quickly drowning in saved ‘things’ and cant make use of it. As R.J. Nestor put it in <a href="https://signup.rjnestor.com/posts/weekend-upgrade-35-surface-tension">his newsletter</a>, the issue is often that capture is too easy and I would also argue too permanent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…capture in itself is not the primary problem for most of us. The problem is that we capture too many things, and we don’t have a corresponding way to surface what we’ve captured. — R.J. Nestor, Surface Tension</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ve all be there. Like a note hoarder, we can&rsquo;t bear to not save something, or later delete it “just incase”. When digital storage is so plentiful, there might seem like no downside to collecting absolutely everything to refer to at some point in the future. However, it then becomes impossible to sift through the pointless stuff and get to the important parts of your system.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/605ca0ed12.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In almost every productivity system I have come across there is always some kind of ‘inbox’ followed by a sorting phase. A review <em>has</em> to take place to make the most of the things you have saved, no matter if they are digital or physical things, you <a href="/2022/12/31/manual-practices-to.html">must review them</a>. The next part is painful, though, you must now admit your errors and throw out most of what you saved.</p>
<p>Not throw it out per se, but at least no longer dwell on it. If it’s digital, consider deleting it or perhaps not tagging and sorting it. If is a physical note, don’t copy it anywhere else, read it, digest it, and then decide to move on or not. The real benefit of physical notes, of which I am a massive proponent of, is that by writing them out you are more likely to remember them anyway. As much as <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/you-will-remember-information-longer-you-hand-write-notes.html">70 percent increase</a> if you go through them again in the next 24 hours, and it produces <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210319080820.htm">stronger brain activity</a> too.</p>
<p>This post is about more than that though, it is about getting the most out of <em>your</em> system, and that involves sorting your notes afterwards. I have tried <a href="/2023/03/17/indexing-a-used.html">indexing my notebooks</a> for more benefit, but that didn’t last long. Copying out and sorting my mess of a handwritten ledger has proven is essential to surfacing information I can use later on. Making sure the helpful notes hang around, and the useless ones fade away.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>One thing I love about consuming so much written on the internet is that it raises interesting thoughts in my head. Sure, I get annoyed at the constant cycle of AI this, metaverse that, but newsletters like <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/on-the-internet-you-can-in-some-sense?publication_id=9317&amp;isFreemail=true">this edition for Garbage day</a> from Ryan Broderick really made me think.</p>
<p>He discusses a friend who passed away, leaving behind herself scattered over the internet, and ponders on what will stay behind. The below passage brought up thoughts about the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_(2017_film)">Disney film CoCo</a>, that you die twice, once in physical form and again when the last person alive forgets about you. In the modern world, that could be three times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, it seems, we die three times. First, when you stop breathing, second, when a corporation deletes your account, and, third, when someone says your name for the last time.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve written before about my <a href="/2021/07/27/be-happy-it.html" class="u-in-reply-to">thoughts about death</a>, but the way that technology and the services you have used is interesting to think about. In many ways, I could echo around the web for years after my passing because I have put so much content onto it which could be a comfort or dressing to others in my life. Or I could be permanently deleted once I stop paying.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c5f1d00d31.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Ryan talks about all Facebook Messenger chats disappearing once an account turns into a memorial, which would be something that other people might miss. However, Twitter is now recovering whole accounts that have laid dormant for a while, which will include many people no longer with us. No doubt to flog for profit. Bringing into sight the realisation that where you put your online life could be more important in death.</p>
<p>All this talk of deleting accounts and recovering dormant ones reminds me of wanting a username that appears unused. That handle that I desire <em>could</em> in fact be someone’s comfort, and the ethics of recovering it become a little murky. Thankfully, I feel blessed that I have placed my posts on micro.blog, and they will remain online indefinitely <a href="https://www.manton.org/2023/05/13/reclaiming-usernames-policy.html" class="u-in-reply-to">thanks to Manton</a>.</p>
<p>So, should the time come for me to leave this mortal realm, I <em>will</em> die two deaths, but perhaps not a third.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/05/19/my-brief-experiment.html"><h1 class="p-name">My Brief Experiment With Mechanical Keyboards</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Can I apologise if this post triggers you in any way, these are simply my thoughts after using a ‘mechanical keyboard’ for a bit, and they may not be all positive. The people that love using these types of keyboard are plentiful online, so I may get an influx of name-calling after this, but please bear with me. I decided to <a href="/2023/05/08/i-might-regret.html">have a bit of an experiment</a> and dove in knowing absolutely nothing, so this very well is the reason behind my thoughts.</p>
<p>First things first, I bought a <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k3-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron K3 v2</a> after some feedback online and seeing that this was reasonably cheap and approachable. This came with Optical Brown switches. I chose this because and after years of using a Magic Keyboard I felt this was a good introduction to this minefield. Your thoughts may differ on this, but I want to be transparent straight away.</p>
<p>So, I get it. I think that using a mechanical keyboard provides so much tactile feedback that it’s hard to understand until you use one. Known for their ‘clicky’ keys and their multitude of modifications and set-ups you can make, the world of mechanical keyboards is one that I now understand. However, I had two major issues that may be due to this specific keyboard or may just be trade-offs you have to make, I don’t know, but let&rsquo;s just say I am writing this on a magic keyboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3fd99b390a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="comfort">Comfort</h2>
<p>They’re no getting around the fact that I didn’t find the K3 very comfortable to use. To accommodate the travel of the keys, even this ‘low-profile’ keyboard is considerably chunkier than I am used to. I knew this going in so allowed it some time to get to, but the hovering my hands had to do, and the weird slant of the keys just made a long typing session painful.</p>
<p>Could I have become used to it, perhaps over time. Was a prepared to risk it, absolutely not. The K3 added its own ‘screw your wrists’ take on this by slanting the keyboard itself slightly toward you, but the keys slightly away. Meaning, I had no confidence in using the keyboard even after a week or so of hard use. My wrists hurt bad. I tried a wrist rest, I tried changing my posture, I tried numerous things, but it was just too different for my body to like.</p>
<h2 id="wireless">Wireless</h2>
<p>As I wanted this to replace my current set up, being wireless was a big selling point. I went into this knowing that this might mean that keypresses are a little less reliable and that wired is often the preferred set up for people. The Keychron K3 was straightforward to set up, came with Mac-specific keys already on the board, but still fell down. The connect time for using the keyboard after being idle for more than 10 minutes was painful. I could change this in the setting to keep it witched on, but opted instead to use the wired mode – only this didn’t work either.</p>
<p>The cable that the keyboard comes with doesn’t connect to my Mac, at all. Why on earth it is a USB-A version I don’t know, but obviously if you have a Mac that&rsquo;s less than 4 years old you have to use a dongle, but the cable doesn’t work with a dongle! I am not <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Keychron/comments/m5frps/unable_to_use_keychron_k2_with_macbook_in_wired/">alone in finding this out</a>. It works with a regular USB-C cable, so I <em>could</em> use it wired, but at this point I’d just about given up. My frustration for this issue is squarely aimed at this specific keyboard and the choices they made to provide a Mac setup keyboard without a Mac cable, so I can’t hold that against other companies.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-just-me">This is just me</h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t hold this against all mechanical keyboards, like I said before, I genuinely understand the enjoyment people get from using them. The reason I no longer have one is personal, not a slight against those that do. To sum up, I chose to return the Keychron K3 and go back to my Magic Keyboard for a few reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfort of typing in a position I am used to</li>
<li>Connection issues with a Mac</li>
<li>Not wanting to spend more money and still not be happy</li>
<li>Touch ID</li>
</ul>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my update in a nutshell.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>A few years ago, I read the book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781090532084">Ruined by design</a>. You could consider it <a href="/2023/05/12/finished-reading-hooked.html">Hooked</a> written by an ethical designer. It talks a lot about doing the work that you want to do, and not compromising on your morals and values. At various points in your life, that might be extremely difficult or impossible, but you must know what your values are and stand for them in everything you do.</p>
<p>If you want to be the type of person that enjoys working, either for yourself or someone else, you must display your core values <em>all</em> the time. Do not compromise yourself to gain things, as this will just make you feel a bit rubbish, not to mention the frustration that comes from being led down a path you would rather not take. Believe me, I’ve been there in my early life, compromising wheat I stood for in return for more money or a flashy title. There is nothing at the end of the path but crap feelings and lack of motivation.</p>
<p>When I look at people in my working life that struggle to get things done, it is because they would rather not do the tasks that they have. No-one wants to do <em>everything</em> that they have to do, but a general sense of enjoyment and belief leads to better productivity. You don’t have to have the best job in thew world, you just need it to be something that reflects you as a person. Pursuing passion has more to do with reflecting yourself in the things you do that <em>what</em> you do.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I am hyper aware that I have been mentioning this constantly for quite a while but bare with me. Since watching a few videos on YouTube about Notion, their algorithm thinks I am some kind of productivity hustle porn obsessive. It constantly forces videos about apps, morning routines and hacks to make my life my productive – when in fact my outlook is the opposite. There <a href="/2023/01/30/there-will-always.html">will always be more work</a> to do, so it’s time to do less, <a href="https://dailystoic.com/do-less-better/">but better</a>.</p>
<p>My biggest productivity tip isn’t <a href="/2023/05/13/you-do-not.html">another app</a> or staring at the sun at 6am. The best thing you can do is get a notebook and use it. You don’t need to spend much, it doesn’t need to be fancy. Any old book you have lying around or can pick up for cheap is fine. Simply have a notebook by your side and jot things down when you need to.</p>
<p>Everything, absolutely everything. Write it down in the same place as everything else. You <em>could</em> use a notes app if that’s your thing, but make sure you use one notes app, it really doesn’t matter which one, and keep all your notes in one place. I am a massive proponent of <a href="/2023/03/12/what-is-my.html">keeping a notebook</a>, but digital notes are often the route for most people to get stuff done. Just make sure you write little notes about everything that there is even a small chance you think it might be helpful. You <strong>will not</strong> remember it, write it down.</p>
<p>You don’t need to start a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com">second brain</a>, or do some weird <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management">PKM</a> stuff, you just need to have a place <em>full</em> of things that will help you out. Record things you find interesting, things you need to remember, things that might help you work later on, literally anything you might need later on. You don’t need to start a <a href="/2023/05/10/my-adventures-with.html">commonplace book</a> or anything, you just require a notebook around, all the time.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-previews-live-speech-personal-voice-and-more-new-accessibility-features/">announced</a> new accessibility features and tools that will help people with cognitive, vision, hearing, and mobility needs. These tools are designed to be user-friendly and incorporate on-device machine learning to ensure privacy. This shows Apple&rsquo;s longstanding commitment to accessibility and making products for everyone.</p>
<p>Assistive Access is a feature that distills apps and experiences into their essential features, making them easier to use for people with cognitive disabilities. The feature focuses on activities that are foundational to iPhone and iPad, such as connecting with loved ones, capturing and enjoying photos, and listening to music. Assistive Access also includes a distinct interface with high-contrast buttons and large text labels, as well as tools to help supporters tailor the experience for the individual they support.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9f5326e05d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>For users who are nonspeaking or at risk of losing their ability to speak, Apple has introduced Live Speech and Personal Voice. Live Speech allows users to type what they want to say and have it spoken out loud during phone and FaceTime calls, as well as in-person conversations. Personal Voice allows users at risk of losing their ability to speak to create a voice that sounds like them.</p>
<p>Detection Mode in Magnifier makes it easier for users with vision disabilities to interact with physical objects that have several text labels. For example, while using a household appliance, Point and Speak combines input from the Camera app, the LiDAR Scanner, and on-device machine learning to announce the text on each button as users move their finger across the keypad.</p>
<p>These new features and tools build on Apple&rsquo;s long history of making technology accessible, so that everyone has the opportunity to create, communicate, and do what they love. The groundbreaking features were designed with feedback from members of disability communities every step of the way, to support a diverse set of users and help people connect in new ways.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Slight mislead here, you do need apps, but you don’t need a ton of them. Every single post I see will tell you they use this app and that service, which is great — but that is unique to them. That doesn’t mean <em>you</em> need to start spending money.</p>
<p>In most situations, you will be perfectly fine with the stock options you have available. The only time to start looking at other options is <em>if</em> you start to hit issues. My best advice is to continually try to work around this first. Shortcuts is a wonderful stock app that I use to implement ‘new’ features into apps.</p>
<p>I am as guilty of this app arrival fallacy as anyone. I convince myself that I just require this new thing, and then I’ll be super productive — but I don’t. The truth is that is often hard to accept is that a new app absolutely will not make you more productive. Sure, fancy services look nice, the marketing makes you think you can get a load more done, but the real answer is to work smarter.</p>
<p>You will be more productive by having a good system in place, not having a fancy app. I will say it again for those not paying attention, a <a href="/2019/07/29/a-new-productivity.html">new app will not make you more productive</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’m having a few weird experiences on YouTube at the minute. I watched a <a href="https://micro.blog/gr36/18975057">few videos on mechanical keyboards</a> the other day, and I think I might have ruined Google&rsquo;s impression of me forever. It started as a few PC building things and got worse from there. Mixed in with the usual productivity tripe and hustle things that Google seems to think all people want to watch, I have discovered a whole world of people doing their work with AI.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine and everything. I am a big fan of making the new tools work for you, and use <a href="https://www.notion.so/product/ai">Notion AI</a> frequently — but when it comes down to making AI write your assignments and complete your notes, it all gets a bit silly. If the entire point of performing an action is the result, then AI is arguably the best tool to use. You can achieve some great things and cut down the time you invest dramatically. However, if the activity is the point of the exercise, then just do the work.</p>
<p>The point of writing an essay is to demonstrate your learning. The result is not the point of the exercise, the point is your ability to complete the task. This goes double for getting AI to write your notes. Again, the entire point in writing notes on a subject (in a classroom or out of one) is the practice itself. By writing things down, you remember them, and record them in your words. AI defeats the point.</p>
<p>In these instances, if time saved is what you are trying to achieve with AI, then you’d be better off not doing it at all. To get better at something, learn information or just show others that you know things — Just Do The Work. There are no shortcuts in life, you can&rsquo;t adopt a morning routine or use a tool to cheat your way through because at some point you will get found out. By doing the work, you improve yourself.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/05/10/my-adventures-with.html"><h1 class="p-name">My Adventures With A Commonplace Book</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Stray too far into self-help or productivity circles, and you will soon come across this idea of a commonplace book. The practice of writing everything down and keeping it in a place you can access later is held up as the reason people are successful and a way for you to get the most out of life. Although people like <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/07/h-p-lovecrafts-commonplace-book/">HP Lovecraft</a>, <a href="https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/john-miltons-commonplace-book">John Milton</a> and even <a href="https://myowncommonplacebook.wordpress.com/tag/leonardo-da-vinci/">Leonardo do Vinci</a> kept one by their side, it is a practice that can be hard to stick too in the modern world.</p>
<p>Commonplace books are a tradition spanning from <a href="https://notebookofghosts.com/2018/02/25/a-brief-guide-to-keeping-a-commonplace-book/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">the Middle Ages</a>, but one that seems improper in the modern world. Despite all the obvious benefits of manual tasks, the avoidance of feeling out of place is often a powerful feeling. One that I frequently can’t be overcome, I just don’t want to be <em>that</em> guy. There’s just no getting around the fact that carrying around a notebook in a digital world appears strange to most people.</p>
<p>As such, my first effort at keeping this ‘book’ had to be digital. It makes the most sense as I have my phone or my watch on my wrist nearly all the time, or I am sat at my computer working. Not to mention, all the things I save are then searchable and referenceable easily from all my devices. Saving digital things just makes sense.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9f55ac5bca.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>An app such as Evernote would make an excellent digital commonplace book, in fact, numerous people I know have been doing this all along without even knowing it. Storing photos of notes, whiteboards, web clippings, meeting briefs and all sorts of things in the app to refer to later. Not wanting to spend money on Evernote after being burnt before, I opted to use <a href="/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html">Apple Notes instead</a>.</p>
<p>The main reason for doing this was to make sure I carried things that I wanted to remember. That I got myself into a better state of working though my ideas and working on them later. So, I built <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ed9071a3301944e4b7c368f93cf831db">a Shortcut to help me</a> on this journey. To capture quotes from articles I read, thoughts that I could dictate from my Apple Watch, and also anything else I stumbled across.</p>
<p>The premise was simple. My iCloud notes now contained a folder titled commonplace book. Each time I wanted to capture something, the shortcut checked for a note titled with the current date, if it was missing, it created it along with a time stamped entry. If the note already existed, it appended a time stamped capture to the note.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/69295e6660.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This folder started to fill up with all sorts of things. Quotes, ideas, web clippings, photos and any number of random things. I became quite obsessed with saving things, but I am sure you can already see where this was going. I was absolutely dedicated to saving things in my new commonplace book, but I never went back and looked at it. Never browsed the notes for any other reason than vaguely remembering saving a quote I wanted to reference in some writing.</p>
<p>The digital folder was a great idea, but it was tucked away. It wasn’t in front of me to be able to look at, flick through and review the entries in it. Although I have confidence, some snippets saved would have been used at some point though searching my phone — I just didn’t get any use from it. It became obvious quickly that the whole point of a commonplace book, for me at least, was physically writing things in it.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-book-instead">A Note Book Instead</h2>
<p>OK, I am a little <a href="/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html">obsessed with notebooks</a> at the moment. Since reviewing my plan for 2023, and reading <a href="/2023/01/13/finished-reading-the.html">Revenge of Analogue</a>, I’ve adopted more manual processes. This means writing more with a pen and paper, as well as being aware of the enjoyment gained from tactile things. I even bought a mechanical keyboard, clicky!</p>
<p>So, my journal evolved into a commonplace book. There’s a certain level of worry that comes with even mentioning that you have a commonplace book. Most of the questions I see online are variations of “what do I write in this thing” and these exact questions come whenever you get out your notebook. You have to be prepared for this and answer them with confidence. The practice has existed for hundreds of years, and will do long after you are gone, so don’t worry.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dbb431be3b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Oh, and much like with the digital notebook, the answer to what you write in it is <strong>everything</strong>. While these practices make me much more satisfied in a sensory sense, it isn’t perfect. The fact that everything is written down manually, means that you lose all the advantages that digital note bring. They are not searchable and take up physical storage space.</p>
<p>I tried out <a href="/2023/03/17/indexing-a-used.html">indexing one of my notebooks</a>, using a tag system to allocate areas in which they may be stored if I were to use the <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/12-steps-to-build-a-second-brain/">PARA system</a> for <a href="/2023/04/06/finished-reading-building.html">Building A Second Brain</a>. Given that I never referred back to it ever again in that way, I didn’t bother with the next couple of notebooks I have used. I tend to flick through them and pick up ideas and thoughts as and when I need to. This serves as a nice reminder, a diary of sorts, but also a way to review information to help with memory recall. Thats a Win/Win in my (note)book.</p>

      <p>At the iPhone phone launch last September, a thought started to blossom in my head. As they presented all of their new devices, that no doubt they toiled away for months to create, I couldn’t shake the feeling of melancholy. Sure, they are nice and everything, but we might just have reached the pinnacle of what Apple&rsquo;s current technology can offer.</p>
<p>The truth is, collectively we realised this with smartphones at least a couple of years ago. The iPhone 13, was mostly the 12, that in turn was a more square version of the iPhone 11. You can track the slow and steady ticking forward of the Apple iPhone from the very first one, but what’s inside and what it can actually <em>do</em> tended to take strides forward at least every other year. Now, not so much.</p>
<p>There is a limit to what can be achieved from a rectangle of glass and metal, and there’s something to be said for Apple&rsquo;s consistency instead of Samsungs spaghetti at the wall approach. Unfortunately, for Apple, the downturn in creativity and technology improvement is also shaping into other devices. I’m not kidding either, Apple Watch, iPad, AirPods, MacBook, they are all pretty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meh">meh</a> - and thats a good thing.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0caeebeeb3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="you-cant-do-real-work">You Cant Do Real Work</h2>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s most contentious device, the iPad Pro, is the perfect example. There has been very little need to upgrade your device since 2018. The current model features very little upgrade past a more powerful processor, making it a little <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipad/ipad-pro-faq/ipad-pro-11-inch-3rd-gen-12-9-inch-5th-gen-2021-performance-comparison.html">better on battery and more able</a>. Which is great, until you realise that most things you do on your iPad don’t even tax older iPads. The only thing that has changed a lot is the camera if that&rsquo;s your thing (it really shouldn’t be).</p>
<p>The same can be said for Apple silicone MacBooks. The launch of the M2 MacBook Pro went by with none of the clamouring that the M1 Pro devices got. The tick that had followed the massive tock of desktop devices leaves very little need to upgrade depending on your use case. The M1 Pro powered MacBook that I do all of my work on still feels like it has headroom in every task I throw at it.</p>
<p>So, we’ve rubbished the upgrades for what’s in your hand, and potentially what’s in your bag, now let’s look at the Apple watch. A device that, once Apple sorted out what they wanted it to be, hasn’t seen a meaningful upgrade in years. Each year, the device gets a little faster and a little better on battery, but you’d have to jump up from a device 3–4 years old to see any improvements. Even then, the argument could be made that it wouldn’t really mean a lot.</p>
<p>Whilst presenting the newest version last year, almost each proposed upgrade covered could be attributed to software improvements, many of which would be rolled into older devices anyway. Thank god for the Apple Watch Ultra, <a href="/2022/11/18/apple-watch-ultra.html">one of my favourite devices</a> for a few years, for at least a little excitement. I have a feeling that many purchases, my own included, were fuelled by the desire simply for something new.</p>
<p>I do think this is the right move though. No one wants to be updating their watch every year, and by providing even smaller updates there is less desire to, and less for Apple to shout about. Apple does indeed make devices more aimed towards periodic upgraders than early adopters. Those that get a free phone with their new plan every 2–3 years, rather than us hardcore upgraders.</p>
<p>Apple doesn’t make devices like it used to. We can&rsquo;t fit them on a table as Steve Jobs said they should do, and they don’t always appeal to everyone. The devices are at the peak of what is a feasible upgrade, and that is becoming less and less about headline features. There’s less to crow about but more to love, the devices have peaked and that&rsquo;s fantastic for all users, and our bank balances.</p>

      <p>So, update to my <a href="https://www.gr36.com/2023/05/08/i-might-regret.html">post yesterday</a> about mechanical keyboards.</p>
<p>I bought a <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k3-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron K3</a> because it was cheap and approachable. I like the click, I like the feel but the keys are at a weird angle. So I am not sold yet.</p>
<p>I think I might end up just sticking with a Apple Magic keyboard</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/05/06/the-apple-vr.html"><h1 class="p-name">The Apple VR Headset May Miss The Boat That Never Arrived</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>One of the biggest leaking Apple products I can ever remember might actually see the light of day at WWDC next month. You read that right, it looks highly likely Tim Cook will take to the stage on the Keynote for Apple&rsquo;s develop conference and finally utter the words Reality Pro. Unfortunately, the long-rumoured VR experience from Apple has already missed its chance to make a splash, and will be launched into a market that doesn’t really exist.</p>
<p>Since at least the mid-80’s at various volume levels, futurists have been telling us virtual reality will be a massive thing. The slightly dystopian predictions are that we will at least strap things to our faces instead of staring at screens, and if you listen to some people, we might live a portion of our lives in a virtual world. However, that reality has never really panned out.</p>
<p>It has to be said I am extremely negative towards putting any <a href="/2016/10/10/please-dont-put.html">computer on your face</a>, but still open to the possibility. In many respects, it makes sense, perhaps not to live in a virtual world, but consuming content or playing games is a realistic current and future bet for VR devices. This is where Apple sees its headset fitting in, <a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-vr-headset">running iPad type apps</a> and not diving into a metaverse. Being able to put on oversized goggles to be able to watch or use a gigantic screen instead of needing a large panel appeals to many demographics.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/175c9e87b9.jpg" alt="Image credit: Marcus Kane/Sketchfab" title="Image credit: Marcus Kane/Sketchfab"></p>
<h2 id="you-missed-it">You Missed It</h2>
<p>The issue is that the market for this kind of device is already exhausted. Either physically or metaphorically. Niche gaming sections are saturated with cheaper Quest or PlayStation devices. With others completely turned off to the idea due to a bombardment of Meta né Facebook insisting on the future taking place in their world. The truth is Apple scrambled to build a device to fit into a potential market that was promised for years on end, but no longer exists.</p>
<p>Whatever Apple&rsquo;s entry into VR looks like; or whenever it arrives, it looks set to miss its market bar early adopter Apple fans with too much money. Granted there was a time for about 6 beautiful months where this device made sense. After months of not being able to navigate the web without being inundated with the word metaverse, that time has gone. That time <em>may</em> arrive, but like having business built around web3 in 2023, there’s not much hope currently.</p>
<p>That is the issue with entering into markets that are still emerging. You risk making the wrong bets. Wasting considerable amounts on money building devices that fall flat rather than sail the current wave of hype. This was something that Apple were notoriously good at. They waited, watched and launched their product a little later than others, but well-rounded and pushing industries forward. You only have to look at products like AirPods as an example of Apple usual ‘wait and see’ market tactic.</p>
<p>Which makes Apples VR device all the more strange, and something that no doubt is making them pause and think a bit longer. However, it can be said that we are not dealing with the same Apple any more, and even they can make mistakes – huge million-dollar mistakes. Just don&rsquo;t mention AirPower.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/05/05/intentionality.html"><h1 class="p-name">Intentionality</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>A fairly simple word. Loaded with meaning and a fair bit of woo woo. Who doesn’t intend to do things? However, you’d actually be surprised the number of things you do without really thinking about them. With your mind either wandering around or focused entirely on something else. With a little practice and a lot of thought, intentional actions can spark new feeling and improve mental health.</p>
<p>I do numerous things each day with little to no thought. Due to <a href="/2022/08/30/the-world-is.html">my daughter</a>, and me being a bit of a control freak, I wake at the same time, do the same things and my day doesn’t really start deviating from that same path hours later. In many ways, this period each day, I have very little intentionality. I am not thinking about specifically doing these tasks, but know they need to be done. I’m on autopilot and the time just slips away, but the tasks get done.</p>
<p>There’s another side. A darker loss of intentionality that robs my time and doesn’t achieve anything. Social media <a href="/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html">muscle memory</a> means that despite having no intention of doom scrolling, I am there before I realise it. I intended to do something else, but now the time is gone, and I feel bad about the world.</p>
<p>Even when I complete tasks that I enjoy, that I look forward to, I am often not present. Not intentional with the moment, not spending my time paying attention. I am on autopilot. Thinking about something else entirely and not enjoying what I am doing. No matter what is happening, it’s far too easy to be distracted, to not pay attention, to spend time in your head instead of in the wider world.</p>
<p>When you are paying attention, you can find enjoyment and interest in places you least expect to find it. When you actually look at things and do things intentionally and think about them while you do them, you get much more from the activity itself. If you are not intentional with your time, you will spend it too fast, and you cannot get it back again.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I read Matt Birchler’s <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/i-tried-to-migrate-to-todoist-it-didnt-go-well/">post on The Sweet Setup</a> as soon as it appeared in my feed. Anything he has to say usually leaves me better after consuming it, and it also mentioned Todoist, which I have a soft sport for after <a href="/2020/05/18/how-i-use.html">becoming a brand ambassador</a> a few years ago. It really is a great post, and one that I’ve been able to feel swirling around in Matt&rsquo;s head for some time, but it touches on two points that I really wanted to stress.</p>
<p>As early as the second paragraph, he points out that chasing the perfect app is a fool&rsquo;s game. It is, as Matt puts it, “a path that leads to madness” and will result in you just going around from app to app and not actually using the thing to get anything done. I’m a <a href="/2021/03/19/looking-for-my.html">scholar of this</a> pathetic chasing, so I think I can speak from experience when I wholeheartedly agree with Matt.</p>
<p>He’s clear on this, and does a fantastic job of pointing this out. He is no doubt aware of the sway his posts can have over people (<a href="/2020/01/21/migrating-from-wordpress.html">my self included</a>), so this declaimer of sorts is even more worth paying attention to. If you take absolutely nothing away from the post apart from this, then it will have been a worthwhile read. If, however, you have now downloaded Todoist, or Things, stop and just use what you have.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a2cc9b451b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="there-are-feelings-involved">There Are Feelings Involved</h2>
<p>The second point that is hinted at several points in the post, and then downright stated towards the end, is that you have to pay attention to the way things feel. It&rsquo;s an important trait to be aware of and something that you may not be able to put into words, but even the best app or system in the world can <strong>feel</strong> wrong. If it does, don’t be afraid to leave it alone despite everyone else evangelising for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It turns out that the generally joyful UI of Things was more important to me than I realised, and a longer feature list couldn’t win me over — Matt Birchler</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt speaks of his yearning for change, and whilst it’s essential to take into accounts what other apps can do, if the app you are using just feels better, stick with it. Unless you are hitting walls and cant do things because features are missing, you won&rsquo;t gain anything by messing around.</p>
<p>If you get a better feeling from the app you already have you will use it more, something particularly critical if that app you are using needs you to use it to get things done. It is one of the reasons I now just <a href="/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html">use a notebook</a>. Everything in my logical brain tells me it’s worse, possibly in every single way, but <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">the feeling of using it and writing in it</a> trumps all.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/04/27/part-of-me.html"><h1 class="p-name">Part Of Me Died When I Left Twitter</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I used one platform, almost solely, for 13 years. It&rsquo;s not as long as some, but on first joining Twitter in 2009 the service felt pretty small, and I didn’t really know what to do with it, but I instantly ‘got it’ and it became my home. I tweeted constantly, shared a large part of my life on it, and met some remarkable people that I am glad to call friends. Leaving it behind was the best decision, but part of my was left behind when I did.</p>
<p>Using Twitter, I didn’t feel that I needed to shape myself to deal with algorithms or trendy topics. I just tweeted what I thought or what I was doing and for some reason people liked it. My followers ballooned during my time hacking iPhones, and later on, Android phones. With many sticking around for years to come. I started and sunsetted two reasonably successful podcasts and owe most of the success to Twitter.</p>
<p>I feel as if I gave Twitter such a massive portion of my life and all of it is now gone. Although, as said before, I am glad I walked away, I feel sad that that time in my life has gone for good. Upon handing over a portion of my personality to Twitter, I expected it to go on forever, but that little package of my life just exists in memory now. No more good times (although to be fair, they stopped in about 2018) but no more stress and worry.</p>
<p>Twitter was the only place on the internet that I hated with all my heart, yet couldn’t help still using it. I felt indebted because I had given it such an important place in my life that my usage <em>had</em> to continue. I hated constantly broke my life down into 280 character bite sized chunks. Thankfully, I was given a big enough push and my mind can now heal. I accept that this part of me is now dead, and long may it stay that way.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>As millions of users scramble to see where to place our social alliance in the next wave of locked platforms, there is an opposite movement. Existing social networks are investigating how to attract new users but seem destined to put their foot in it by ruining their service. One after another, services change major features, or their whole app, searching for revenue. Forgetting everything that set them apart in the first place and ruining lots of the user experience. All in desperate need of ad revenue.</p>
<p>You don’t have to look very hard to see how much can be generated by showing your users tailored adverts. Despite every user hating them, gigantic companies with ridiculous income are built on the back of them. The king of the hill and the admiration of others in the market is Facebook, who rakes in more than $110billion a year, with all of it being, bar a minimal percentage, from adverts.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/696801c38b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Although social networks that don’t and won’t show adverts exist, such as <a href="https://glass.photo">photo sharing app Glass</a>, there is no denying that showing adverts is vastly more profitable. You only need to look at Netflix and the realisation that <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/netflix-sees-advertising-business-generating-10-of-total-revenue-as-it-matures-73938137">ad supported users provide more income</a> than paid ones. As soon as this becomes reality, the service is destined to be ruined beyond recognition and dissolve into a regular TV network, over the internet.</p>
<p>Social media upstart from 2022 BeReal is in a bit of a tailspin and <a href="https://getmatter.com/email/23422113/?token=23422113%3AStzdEG76rMkxOLl_FX9Z-gRB4Xw">currently testing</a> the ability for users to post twice more a day. A move no doubt motivated by the reduced time that their users interact with the app per day. The max two-minute scramble to post during the allotted time is simply not enough time to sell users things, and that cuts the earning potential down dramatically. In return, turning their app from something different and quirky with a unique take, to a worse Snapchat.</p>
<p>While we’re on the ephemeral messaging app, it seems they are loosing themselves in the pursuit of ad revenue too. Once Snap employee and current stockholder Ellis Hamburger <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23672769/social-media-inevitable-death-monetization-growth-hacks">tells their tale</a> of fighting the good fight inside the company. As they put it, “trying to make Snapchat different from every other social media app” only to become aware of the thirstiness as a death knell to what makes it great. As they search for more and more engagement, to show you more and more ads.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t exclusive to mobile apps, either. Adverts have ruined the web as a whole for as long as most of us can remember. Why did we bring this print-based mentality to the web? Covering every inch of spare space on your nicely designed web page like you did the spare inches in the editorials. And the news stories. And the buildings. And the <a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/boat-advertisements-beach-vacation-ad/">beaches</a>.</p>
<p>Like an invasive species, adverts ruin everything. They take up space where they shouldn&rsquo;t be, they track everyone around the web. They try to sell you things you don&rsquo;t need, and now they are changing your favourite apps and ruining services because they pay the most money. Advertising dollars are like a siren&rsquo;s call that cannot be avoided. You can tie yourself blindfolded to the mast of your ship as long as you like, but once you succumb to their call, they strangle the life out of great things and make them suck.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Without going back and checking where, I am sure I have referred to my wife description of me. No, not that one. This might come of a bit of a shock to someone that follow me online, given my disposition to moan about lots of things — she calls me &ldquo;annoyingly positive&rdquo;. To her, I am that guy that looks at everything one way and sees where we can move forward from it.</p>
<p>This stems from a childhood that I wont go into, but I have always had an ability to see the way forward, try to lean into the positive aspects of everything and &ldquo;just keep swimming&rdquo; as <a href="https://youtu.be/E-ZF5r1F7nY?t=42">Dory would say</a>. Plus I&rsquo;m an introvert and hate complaining anyway!</p>
<p>What this doesn&rsquo;t mean is I am not naive in thinking the down times don&rsquo;t exist. I can still &lsquo;sit in the mud&rsquo; as Simon Sink would call it, but more I realise that this too shall pass. Optimism is about being hopeful and positive about the future, that bad things <em>will</em> happen, and it&rsquo;s ok to have struggles and issues with them, but there are always better times coming. You may feel like you are in a dark tunnel at the moment, but optimism keeps me working towards the light and everything will be ok.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/04/18/dark-mode-is.html"><h1 class="p-name">Dark Mode Is More Personal</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Since the launch of dark mode in iOS I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve disabled the feature other than testing. I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of the constant white used in modern iOS and, although debatable, it saves a bit of battery life by switching off pixels. However apps that don&rsquo;t customise the way dark mode looks really suck.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s much more personal preference that&rsquo;s needed once you flick the switch to dark mode. Some apps opt for replacing the glaring white for simple black. While others go for dark shades of blue or grey instead. Meaning that apps can show their personality and make theirs stand out, but not always to taste.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a99e236dc1.jpg" alt="Screenshots of micro.blog and instead in both light and dark mode"></p>
<p>Take the above examples of the upcoming 3.0 update to the micro.blog app and Instagram. One of my most used apps micro.blog uses a not very dark blue colour which is not to my taste at all. I&rsquo;d much prefer the black of Instagram for the app background and this is where dark mode triggers much more personal preference.</p>
<p>Is it enough for me to stop using the app, no, but it&rsquo;s enough to make me think almost every time I open it that I wish I could change it. Couple this with having a look at <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a> and <a href="/2023/04/15/i-know-its.html">thinking their app looks great</a>, I switched into light mode for a bit and what a refreshing change it makes. I&rsquo;m still not convinced with all the white burning my eyes, but it takes away all these personal preferences and leaves me with good looking apps.</p>
<p>Thankfully a lot of apps give you the option to pick and choose, or even theme the way the app looks. The excellent micro.blog app <a href="/2023/02/13/gluon-my-perfect.html">Gluon</a> gives you the choice to switch to an OLED friendly black background. <a href="/2018/04/29/finding-a-use.html">Drafts</a>, the well liked app for all of your text even offers customised themes and a selection of downloadable options. I just found it strange that I don&rsquo;t really care about every app using white, or slightly off white, but when it comes to off black - yuck.</p>

      <p>I think I get it now. I&rsquo;ve been asked for years how I manage to write a lot, and I just shrug and think it&rsquo;s not so hard. Even though my blogging does come and go I manage to have plenty of ideas and publish posts, but not at the moment.</p>
<p>At the minute I feel as if I am blocked from ideas. I feel as if <a href="/2023/04/08/inspiration.html">inspiration</a> doesn&rsquo;t like me, or my brain is  now broken. I&rsquo;ve tried to push through this a few times, just <a href="/2020/08/17/sitting-in-the.html">sit in the chair</a> and write something but I end up messing around on social media. Frustrating as it is, at least I don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to post - I just enjoy when I do.</p>
<p>I will just keep posting things I find and making short posts waiting for something to strike. For an idea that lasts long enough for post to be written or my motivation improves.</p>

      <p>My daughter is the cutest little thing. I know everyone says that about their kids, but here is my submission as proof. Lucie struggles with almost everything, she has what most people call ‘complex needs’. She relies completely on us as a family to help to support her, but she tries her hardest to do whatever one else does.</p>
<p>She has only two loves in the world, <a href="/2022/09/20/lucie-loves-shoes.html">shoes, and</a> teddies. Perhaps I come a distant third, but I’m not convinced. Anyway. The world seems to finally be waking up to providing more accessible things like clothes and activities, and along with this comes toys that actually represent disabled people. We found the greatest cuddly toy of all time on Facebook, and Lucie absolutely loves it.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b76c178768.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s a brightly coloured bunny with a feeding tube, just like Lucie&rsquo;s. Complete with attachable tube and syringe! When Lucie first saw it, she lifted her top and tapped her button to show that she understood the bunny had one like her. She now carries it around to doctor&rsquo;s appointments and occasionally when she is hungry, and my heart melts.</p>
<p>It’s remarkable what representation in the things that we see means to people. The bunny is just like her and means she will never feel alone in her struggles.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The arrival times of ideas are strange. Often when I feel like writing, there is nothing ready to come out. Then at other points, ideas come at the wrong times and never get to fruition. Despite thinking about the ideas, and sometimes writing a blog post in my head, they are gone as soon as I get distracted. As I strain myself afterwards, willing my neurones to make the same connections they did before, I am typically led to think about inspiration and where it comes from.</p>
<p>For me, it frequently comes from the strangest places. Occasionally, I do go looking for it, consuming books or watching videos and jotting down some ideas, willing for the ideas to coalesce into a blog post. These can then be incubated and sometimes appear later on, but often times trying to force it doesn’t work. Every so often, it is as if my <a href="/2023/04/06/valid-feelings.html">emotions block me</a> from thinking too deeply about anything.</p>
<p>At the points, quite out of the blue, something will be said in passing and hit me with a burst of energy. A throw away line can cause me to become excited at where my thoughts are going, or pause whatever I am doing and just think for a while. At moments like these, it is not a surprise that some people believe the inspiration for things comes from a magical place. Inspiration regularly doesn’t make sense to me, and when you don’t understand things, it’s easier to blame the gods!</p>
<p>Of course, the inspiration I need to write a terrible blog post is a lot different to the ideas needed for great pieces of art. Writing a book, or creating a masterpiece, requires study, dedication and the using of time wisely. Perhaps when your life is dedicated to such a thing, inspiration strikes much easier, that it is like a skill that needs to be worked on, or a muscle that must be trained.</p>
<p>The fact that my brain can get from one throw away line listening to a podcast, and produce a few hundred words is still a little magical to me, and I hope that never stops.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I forget where I first heard the expression, but I have long held the idea that we are all the same person wearing a different mask. We all arrive in the same state, and sure we might have some biological tendencies toward certain things, but the only separator is life. At any moment, the only difference between us is a combination of our experiences up to that point. For me, that is the most fascinating thing about the world.</p>
<p>I am absolutely fascinated by other peoples thought patterns and the way they think about life. Especially those that have a way of looking at the world that I don’t understand, or agree with. Rather than judging them or dismissing them, I often ask <em>far</em> too many questions because I want to understand them better. This often leads me down a path of discovery and understanding of the reason behind differing options, and questioning myself.</p>
<p>The motivator for this is the question that my Grandfather taught me to think about everyone. “What are they doing that I can learn from”. He would talk to people doing different crafts at Christmas fairs with no intention of doing them. Religious people that came to the door, despite being <a href="/2022/09/21/this-might-be.html">a devote Christian</a>, and sometimes even people preaching in the street. Even though he understood himself and what he wanted from the world, he would ask questions to learn from everyone else.</p>
<p>Now, I am not one for talking to people in the street, but this constant learning from different people is ingrained in me somehow. Don’t get me wrong, I do walk away from some conversations shaking my head a little, but there is always some understanding to be found. Once you realise that we <em>are</em> all the same person, you can begin to understand why people are they way they are. You can understand why they adopt the view points they do, and then begin to question yourself.</p>
<p>You begin to question the way you look at the world, rather than thinking you are correct all the time. Rather than the imposter syndrome breading environment it sounds like, it leads to an inquisitive nature that is keen to learn more about almost every thought process you have. Which, if I <em>can</em> state some solid grounding for my beliefs, is the best way to look at the world.</p>
<p>By recognising differences, and understanding them, you begin to realise how similar we all are and the superficial bullshit the world seems to use to separate us doesn’t matter in the slightest.</p>

      <p>Reading all the wondering on why people still use Twitter seems redundant. If you speak to anyone outside of tech or news circles that uses Twitter, they don&rsquo;t care who owns the company.</p>
<p>It still provides what it has done for more than a decade and until it dies completely will continue to do so.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It’s been a while since I updated my blog because I’ve been pretty busy with life, and my posts often come in waves of inspiration. The thoughts that I have that turn into blog posts are ones that I don’t go looking for, they are ones that strike me, cause me to think about them, perhaps write a note, that later turns into a post. They come at unpredictable times, but they are regularly dulled by my emotions.</p>
<p>When I have something to worry about, or something major going on, I find it very hard to think about other things with the depth needed. Ideas still come, but I am unable to work them through to completion when in my distracted state – which is currently worrying about my family.</p>
<p>Both myself and my wife have been working through the social care required <a href="/2022/08/30/the-world-is.html">for our daughter</a>, and it has brought up many emotions. It’s exciting for Lucie to have her very own personal assistant who started <a href="/2023/04/04/we-have-a.html">working with her this week</a>, but also extremely disorientating. Our lives for so long have revolved around our roles and responsibilities regarding Lucie&rsquo;s care needs, frequently at the detriment to our lives. However, we both know what we signed up for, we both view it as just being a parent, and are having a bit of a hard time stepping back.</p>
<p>The reality is I feel very conflicted about the whole thing and some of the emotions I feel out of place. Almost as if I shouldn’t be feeling the way that I do, but the realisation that all of my feelings are valid is important. The worst thing to do is hide them away and think that they are somehow wrong. There’s a tendency to bury them away instead of processing them and getting to a state of acceptance.</p>

      <p>Like <a href="https://micro.blog/martinfeld/18175662">Martin</a>, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the intersection of Mastodon and micro.blog a little recently. As much as I dont want to consume social media like I did with twitter, I am starting to think that perhaps the amount of updates I post sometimes dont fit very well as being part of my blog</p>

      <p>Whenever the internet loses its mind on something, I find it fascinating. Not to join in with the hot takes, but to see and digest what makes a large proportion of people emotional and try to understand the world a bit better. In these instances, a large proportion of people become experts in the respective field being discussed. The most notable of which was everyone who turned into immunologists during the pandemic, but it constantly happens.</p>
<p>Recently, I read numerous opinions on the way Spotify is redesigning its app and everyone gives their feedback. Much of it being open criticism of the direction the company is leaning and the complete redesign of its mobile apps. This continually happens with services like Spotify because their users become invested in the service and are right to express their concern.</p>
<p>However, I think it’s important to remember that no-one outside of Spotify really knows how and why decisions are made. For the risk of becoming an internet expert, I feel like I have enough knowledge of the moving parts behind running a business. More so with the choices and compromises that have to be made when owning a product or launching a new one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it comes with a challenge. If you’re going to build this thing into the same application, you’re going to make it back to trade-offs. The trade-off is that you can’t just make the application more complicated. There are benefits to that, but there are also drawbacks - Gustav Söderström</p></blockquote>
<p>The reality is, you seldom get the product you want to launch. There are a huge number of issues that crop up when designing and making such a complex thing that it can be amazingly frustrating. For fear of never launching anything, you quickly have to come to terms with the fact that perfection is the enemy. If you are expecting to get everything the way you want it, then you will be waiting a long time.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6f373d6624.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I listened with interest when Gustav Söderström <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23638082/spotify-redesign-gustav-soderstrom-tiktok-stream-podcasts-music-discovery">talked to Alex Heath</a> about the new redesign and also some of the compromises that had to be made when he launched the original Spotify mobile app back in 2010. He discussed how they know that the implementation of Podcasts into the new App is not perfect, but it’s the best compromise they can make. In a world where Apple Podcasts is used by 98.5 of users, there is just no point making another app.</p>
<p>Is it perfect, no, but it’s the best decision they can make for their users. There will always be people who don’t like the changes companies make and no longer use the product, that&rsquo;s unavoidable. There is also be a vocal bunch that shut up and use the new update anyway – remember the fuss on Facebook newsfeeds back in the day?</p>
<p>Making a product is just one long stream of compromises and decisions based on the information you have. No-one has the same information as the people inside the company making decisions. I realise there is a whole industry built around criticising the designs that tech companies make, I used to be one of them, but there’s a level of understanding needed. I have not been a Spotify user for years now, but I understand exactly where Gustav Söderström is coming from.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the market usually dictates when you have to move to survive, and it’s not always where you want to go. Thankfully, it sounds to me like he genuinely agonises over these things and wants the best for their users, and every so often you have to admit that user is not you any more.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I am amazed at the <a href="/2023/03/13/seems-a-controversial.html">usefulness of recent advancements in Large Language Model AI</a>. Having it <a href="https://www.notion.so/product/ai">integrated into Notion</a>, the tool I use most, has saved me a significant amount of time and increased my productivity at work. I use it to summarise meeting notes, write content from video scripts, and more. The cost pays for itself several times over in time saved – but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I have no concerns.</p>
<p>The technology, synonymous with (not so)OpenAI, is being used by a wide range of companies. Microsoft is integrating it into Bing searches, and just last week, more apps began to use it. Google is building PaLM, their more generalised LLM, <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/generative-ai">into Workspace</a>, including Docs, Sheets, Mail, and Slides. Other companies are bound to follow, meaning that almost anything you see may not have been written by whom you attribute the words.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/715ae6567b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Google was the first to start my thoughts about the degradation of thought put into words with quick replies in messages and emails. If you can reply with a tap instead of thinking about what you write, the meaning loses its value somewhat. Now that AI-generated content is available everywhere, the words written by other people carry even less value.</p>
<p>This might seem absurd to say, for a little thank-you text or a one-line reply to an email. However, the <a href="https://youtu.be/6DaJVZBXETE">Google demo video</a> shows the sending of a “Thank You” message to “the team” which is verging on the ridiculous. As my Grandad would always say, “words are cheap, it&rsquo;s actions that pay the bills” – when even the words are not written by you, it defeats the point, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not far from being able to run <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca">personalised LLM on a local machine</a> with very little computing power. This will bring wonderful improvements to the way we work, especially in creative environments and offices. However, the weight of words will begin to matter less and less. If you cannot take the time to write and send a thank-you note or a thoughtful reply to your teams, then no one will believe in <em>anything</em> written.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">

Both are popular options for writers, artists, and anyone who wants to keep their notes organised. But which one is the best for you? Much like the <a href="/2023/02/11/moleskine-vs-field.html">comparison with Moleskine notebooks</a>, many people cant decided between Field Notes and Field Books so in this post, I’ll take a closer look at Field Notes and Field Book notebooks and compare them to help you decide.</p>

<h2 id="field-book-notebooks">Field Book Notebooks</h2>
<p>Field Book notebooks are a bit larger than Field Notes notebooks, but they offer more space for writing and drawing. They&rsquo;re also more customisable, with options for different paper types, bindings, and covers. Field Book notebooks are more expensive than Field Notes notebooks, with prices ranging from $20 to $50, depending on the options you choose.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of Field Book notebooks is their versatility. They&rsquo;re great for a variety of uses, from writing and drawing to scientific research and field work.

<h2 id="field-notes-vs-field-book-notebooks-which-one-is-best-for-you">Field Notes vs Field Book Notebooks: Which One is Best for You?</h2>
<p>When it comes down to it, the choice between Field Notes and Field Book notebooks depends on your individual needs.

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’m still really early in <a href="/2023/03/03/the-simplest-path.html">my notebook use</a>, but I’ve <a href="/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html">filled a couple</a> of them now. When I chose to use a notebook, I was already thinking about ways to make my notes findable. The action of writing them out manually increases my retention drastically, but I still want to be able to refer to them if needed. The most logical way to do this might be to copy the important ones into a digital service, but then comes the decision on what is important or not, so I decided to tag and index my notes.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/47a4a77d75.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The inspiration for this came from my belief that even with digital apps, you still require <a href="/2022/12/31/manual-practices-to.html">some kind of manual curation</a>. If I can quote myself, “What I have noticed from this cycle of trying is that without conscious thought, digital tools can be just as bad as physical ones”. So, if I were to use a digital service, I would go through and tag everything with a rough topic – which can be done manually too. The last few pages are reserved for an index to list these tags and mark the page numbers.</p>
<p>This could, of course, be a massive waste of time, I will only know how this will go when I need to refer to them, but I hope that this will help. If nothing else, it has meant I spent a few minutes flicking through my notebooks and reviewing my notes, further improving my chance of recall. I am convinced of the improvements that carrying a notebook with me has made, and the great thing is I can mould the process as I go along.</p>
<p>I’m not one for monthly spreads and making my notebook pretty, my handwriting sucks anyway, it’s more of a tool for my brain. It reflects my scattered thoughts and working life, but I hope my indexing brings a little more order to it.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I have now read three different translations of Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. Each one begins with some background information, details about the way it was written, and quite a bit of musing on what he was actually writing for. It wasn&rsquo;t written as a book, nor for public consumption, but more as a personal journal or notebook. This got me thinking about <a href="/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html">my notebook</a> and how it would be viewed if anyone stumbled across it after I&rsquo;m gone.</p>
<p>A few people have asked me what I write in my notebook or what it&rsquo;s for, and my answers are always abstract. There&rsquo;s a bit of hand-waving and non-specific words because I find this almost impossible to answer. The general answer is everything. It contains notes about anything I think about. Thoughts, ideas, tasks I need to do, food orders, meeting notes – there&rsquo;s not much that isn&rsquo;t in there.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c5f370da43.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In truth, I consider it to be a personal self-help book. It contains loads of notes to myself on lessons learned and ideas to digest. It is both my instructor and my muse towards a better life. There are many notes that echo the meditations that Marcus wrote – words of encouragement to myself or a scolding for living wrong. It contains quotes I hear, things I want to research later, and all the other things that may be contained in a commonplace book, but with an equal amount of uselessness.</p>
<p>My notebook is highly personal, not because it contains anything embarrassing, but for the fact that it would be next to useless for anyone but myself (and you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to read my handwriting). Embracing all of these manual processes is still fairly new to me, but I feel as if I have rediscovered a life hack. My notebook is always with me, stuffed in my back pocket with a pen, so I can write in it whenever I need to, and I couldn&rsquo;t be without it.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>One of the most common questions I get asked is whether or not the notebooks are A6 paper size. After doing some research and comparing the dimensions, I can confidently say that Field Notes are not A6 size.</p>
<p>A6 paper size measures 105mm x 148mm or 4.13 inches x 5.83 inches. However, Field Notes dimensions are 89mm x 140mm or 3.5 inches x 5.5 inches. Although they may seem similar in size, they are not the same. You can adapt them sightly to fit in different size note book such as fitting a <a href="/2023/03/04/do-field-notes.html">Field Notes in a Midori Passport</a>.</p>
<p>So, what is A6 paper size, and why is it important to note that Field Notes are not A6? A6 paper size is a popular international standard used for paper, envelopes, and other stationery items. It&rsquo;s widely used in Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world. However, it&rsquo;s not a common paper size in the United States, where Field Notes are made.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Field Notes are not A6 size, they are still a great option for those who prefer a compact notebook that fits perfectly in a pocket or bag. The unique size of Field Notes makes them ideal for a <a href="/2023/03/10/who-uses-field.html">huge range of people</a> for quick notes, sketches, and reminders on the go.

Never worry about <a href="/2023/03/04/what-to-write.html">what to write in a Field Notes</a> because the answer is anything!</p>
<p>In addition to their convenient size, Field Notes offer a variety of styles and designs to choose from. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a classic, simple notebook or something more colourful and creative, there&rsquo;s a Field Notes notebook for everyone. They also come in a range of paper types, including lined, graph, and blank pages.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For far too long, we’ve had <a href="/2019/11/20/how-i-use.html">far too many meetings</a> of professionals involved in <a href="/2022/08/28/im-proud-of.html">my daughter&rsquo;s</a> care. She needs numerous medical appointments, but we also waste a lot of time talking about the things they think she needs. We spend even more time talking about what the rest of the family requires, especially myself and my wife.</p>
<p>They call us many nice things. Tell us that we require help and support, and then some more charming things. It&rsquo;s all very pleasant. The reality is that, in their professional opinion, we can’t continue the way we do with little to no social care and compare us to other families in similar situations.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bfe4316d5c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I am used to this by now. For many years, I have heard how we do “an amazing job” and that it “must be so hard” with what we go through. Which is lovely, but the truth is we know no other way. Lucie was our first child, so we’ve not experienced anything else. When others tell me I do more than I should, and that the situation we are in is hard, I get confused.</p>
<p>The words of Zen teacher Charlotte Joko Beck in <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781916290303">Death: The End of Self-Improvement</a> always rattle around my head.“it’s only unbearable for as long as you’re under the impression that there might be a cure” is the best explication for our continued ambivalence towards change. Nothing will ever improve, there is no end to the way our life is, so there’s nothing to lust after.</p>
<p>Perhaps if we had experienced a different life first, our outlook would be different? A friend of mine who has cereal palsy explained a similar thing to me when talking about his world view. He’s managed to achieve a lot in life and run his own business with a positive mindset because he’s lived with difficulty since birth. Individuals that have not experienced the same and have their life changed through an accident or illness often do not share the same mindset.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with asking for help, that is not the point I am reaching for. It’s more to say that the way I view things is directly related to my experience in life so far. Situations that others may perceive as hard or difficult do not seem so bad to me – mainly because there is some comfort in knowing that there’s no solution possible.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>As much as I share my own, I generally don’t have any interest in other people&rsquo;s lives. This appears to be strange in modern life, as many others consume other lives as entertainment, either on TV or social media. I typically have enough to worry about on my own without looking at anyone else’s. I look upon it in the same terms as the phrase used in relation to prison sentences of “doing your own time” and not letting the people around you affect your life too much.</p>
<p>I do take note of the world around me though, and often find the little snippets of conversation overheard fascinating. It offers a little peek into what other people are experiencing, although I am sure one that is completely out of context. When sat in a coffee shop, or waiting in line, I frequently catch little glimpses into other people&rsquo;s thoughts and I enjoy taking in other view points on things. Finding out what others experience or are talking about is important to understand where your thoughts are.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6dcb89faab.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It is easy in these instances to make judgements about people. To overhear their worries and fears, and regularly their arguments, and then make decisions about them as a person. To become judgemental and look down on them or view them as wrong. You overhear discussions and arguments that often affect your opinion on people that you haven’t even met. Viewing your life as better. On the other side, if you believe social media, everyone&rsquo;s life looks better than ours because we are comparing <a href="/2021/05/31/insides-vs-outsides.html">insides to outsides</a>.</p>
<p>What glimpsing into other lives does to me is make me thankful of the life I have. Grateful that I do not have to go through other people&rsquo;s experiences, and be appreciative of the things I have. As Lucy Lord <a href="https://www.rte.ie/lifestyle/living/2020/1224/1185962-extract-not-a-life-coach-by-james-smith/">said,</a> “If we could all put our problems into one big pile, we’d take our own problems back every single time”. It&rsquo;s easy to view others through a lens or in a snapshot and decide on our own lives, but when we take a step back and see the reality of our world, we realise how lucky we are.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>As a Field Notes user, one of the biggest questions I had before investing in a Midori Passport was whether or not my beloved pocket notebooks would fit inside. After doing some research and trying it out for myself, here&rsquo;s what I found.</p>
<p>First things first, the Midori Passport is designed to hold inserts that measure 4.5 x 3.5 inches. This is a bit smaller than the standard Field Notes size of 5.5 x 3.5 inches. However, with a little bit of creativity, it is definitely possible to make it work.</p>
<p>One option is to trim down your Field Notes to fit inside the Midori Passport. This can easily be done with a paper cutter or even just a pair of scissors. While this may seem like a hassle, it&rsquo;s actually a great way to repurpose partially used notebooks or to create custom inserts that fit your specific needs. You can trim the Field Notes to the exact size of the Midori Passport inserts or leave a little bit of space around the edges, depending on your preference.</p>
<p>Another option is to use a Field Notes cover specifically designed to fit inside a Midori Passport. There are a variety of handmade leather and fabric covers available on sites like Etsy that will keep your Field Notes protected while also fitting perfectly inside your Midori Passport. These covers are not only functional but also add a personal touch to your notebook system.</p>
<p>If you are not keen on trimming or buying a cover, you can always just slip your Field Notes inside the Midori Passport without any extra protection. While this may leave your notebooks a bit more exposed to wear and tear, it&rsquo;s a great option for those who want to keep things simple and streamlined. However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the Midori Passport&rsquo;s elastic closure may not be as tight around the Field Notes, which could potentially lead to some pages falling out.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while Field Notes may not fit perfectly inside a Midori Passport, there are definitely ways to make it work. Whether you choose to trim them down, invest in a cover, or leave them unprotected, the combination of these two popular products is definitely worth considering for any pocket notebook enthusiast. With a little bit of customisation, you can create a notebook system that is both functional and personalised to your specific needs.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Are you looking for a way to document your thoughts, ideas, and experiences in a compact and portable way? Then look no further than a Field Notes <a href="/2023/03/12/what-is-my.html">notebook</a>! These notebooks are the perfect size for on-the-go journaling and can fit easily into your pocket or bag.</p>
<h2 id="why-journaling-is-important">Why Journaling is Important</h2>
<p><a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">Journaling</a> has been shown to have a range of benefits, from reducing stress and anxiety to improving overall mental health. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process and make sense of them, and can provide a sense of clarity and perspective. Additionally, by documenting your experiences, you can look back and reflect on your personal growth and progress over time.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-the-right-field-notes">Choosing the Right Field Notes</h2>
<p>There are a variety of Field Notes notebooks available, each with its own unique cover design and paper style. Consider which one will best suit your needs. If you intend to use a lot of ink or watercolour in your journal, then the Expedition or Waterproof edition may be the best choice. If you prefer a classic look and feel, then the Original Kraft edition may be perfect for you.</p>
<h2 id="setting-a-routine">Setting a Routine</h2>
<p>To get the most out of your journaling experience, set aside a specific time each day to write in your Field Notes notebook. This will help you establish a routine and make journaling a regular habit. Whether it&rsquo;s first thing in the morning, during your lunch break, or before bed, find a time that works best for you.</p>
<h2 id="using-prompts">Using Prompts</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling to come up with something to write about, try using prompts. There are plenty of prompt books available, or you can do a quick internet search for journal prompts. Alternatively, you could write about your day or reflect on a recent experience.</p>
<h2 id="getting-creative">Getting Creative</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to get creative with your journaling. Use different coloured pens or markers, add stickers or washi tape, or include sketches or doodles. This will make your journal more visually interesting and engaging.</p>
<h2 id="reflecting-on-your-progress">Reflecting on Your Progress</h2>
<p>Every few weeks, take some time to reflect on your journaling progress. Look back at what you&rsquo;ve written and reflect on any patterns or themes that have emerged. This will help you better understand yourself and your experiences.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-using-a-field-notes-notebook">The Benefits of Using a Field Notes Notebook</h2>
<p>Aside from the convenience and portability of Field Notes notebooks, using them as a journal also has a range of benefits. The small size of the notebooks can help you focus on the most important aspects of your day, while the limited space can encourage you to write more concisely and with greater intention. Additionally, the unique cover designs and paper styles of Field Notes notebooks can add a personal touch to your journaling experience.</p>
<p>Given it small size and excellent quality, I think that using a Field Notes notebook as a journal is a great way to document your thoughts, ideas, and experiences. By choosing the right notebook, setting a routine, using prompts, getting creative, and reflecting on your progress, you can make the most out of your field notes journaling experience. Happy writing!</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>My son and I spend a not insignificant amount of time at <a href="/2022/07/17/ninja-warrior.html">Ninja Warrior assault courses</a>. After our first exploration to the one in Sheffield, we found one in Leicester we really like and go fairly regularly for an hour or two to challenge ourselves. This is our fun time together. On our last visit, James was very disheartened that he couldn’t <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDi9H--408A">“beat the wall”</a> on the adult course.</p>
<p>“I still can’t get up there dad” he said whilst we grabbed a drink. Making him think twice about trying again. I <strong>could</strong> tell him that it’s a long way up, he’s only small still, and all sorts of comforting things. However, I said the only thing that should be said in this situation and that is, don’t look at what you can’t do yet, look at how far you’ve come.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/aeb670a5a5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When we first went, neither of us were anywhere near getting through half of the obstacles, never mind about beating the wall. Only a few months later, he’s swinging from things, darting up cargo nets and has improved his balance and co-ordination no end. That&rsquo;s not enough for us humans, though, our negativity bias focuses on the wrong things. Fixated on what we are still yet to do, instead of what’s already been done.</p>
<p>There is no better example of this than my task list at work. It’s constantly filled with things I need to do. Like the heads of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra">hydra</a>, and as soon as I check one off, there is at least another to take its place. Which is fine, until a certain point where you realise you’re on a treadmill with no escape. It starts to feel a bit overwhelming and often leads to a lack of motivation. Pretty quickly, life could become untenable.</p>
<p>So let’s flip the thinking here. Instead of looking at the outstanding tasks, let’s look at the ones already checked off. Focus on a done list rather than a to-do list. Any time I feel a bit overwhelmed by what’s on my plate, not only do I remember there will <a href="/2023/01/30/there-will-always.html">always be more work</a>, but also flip through <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">my Bullet Journal</a> and look at all the crossed off items.</p>
<p>From there, it’s pretty easy to frame this into a remarkable achievement, rather than a stressful nightmare.</p>

      <p>I have a <a href="https://micro.blog/numericcitizen/16030689">running joke</a> with <a href="https://micro.blog/numericcitizen">JFM</a> about him having about 3 thousand different blogs. It is very much tongue in cheek because it works for him, but the thought of worrying <a href="gregmorris.co.uk/2021/02/13/where-does-this.html">about where a post goes</a> is not something I want to deal with. I’ve written about the freeing feeling of having <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2021/03/28/why-microblog.html">one blog before</a>, but this path of the least resistance seems to be a universal law to help with almost everything.</p>
<p>There is something to be said about <a href="gregmorris.co.uk/2019/12/17/intentional-barriers.html">intentional barriers</a> in the way of actions you would like to reduce, but for everything else, the easiest path is the way. As Ryder Carol, the inventor of the bullet journal, <a href="https://youtu.be/DZVaVav8lGo">put it,</a> “the more apps, the more gaps”. James Clear, writer of Atomic Habits, also defaults <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2r1jyhT2vg">to one place</a> to store everything. Otherwise, your system falls down due to the need to remember where you saved it in the first place. Defeating the whole point.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter where that place is, but having things spread into multiple areas, or constantly moving them, is just a waste of time and effort. When I think about the amount of time I wasted looking at new <a href="gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/02/writing-instead-of.html">note-taking</a>, <a href="gregmorris.co.uk/2021/03/19/looking-for-my.html">writing</a> and task management apps, I shudder a little. My, and numerous others I see, constant need to look for something ‘better’ costs us dearly.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e3e8f62041.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If truth be told, I could never find one digital place that ticked all my boxes. Instead of remembering the information, I had to remember where I put it. So to cut out all the wasted energy overcoming the resistance in my system, I reverted to perhaps the oldest tool known to man – a writing instrument, and somewhere to use it.</p>
<p>All the resistance is now gone because the only answer is in <a href="gregmorris.co.uk/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html">my notebook</a>. Not only am I not worrying where to put things, but I also know where everything is, I can flick through my notebook and find the note I made with relative ease. My concern over previously being able to search digital notes has dissipated because I remember more of them anyway. The act of writing everything down and being able to read through them at any point means my recall is much higher.</p>
<p>It doesn’t really matter where <strong>your</strong> place is, but by having one place, you are doing yourself a favour. Reducing your cognitive load and giving yourself the best chance at achieving your desired goal. It might be getting tasks checked off, it might be saving ideas, or it might just be the occasional scribble. Take the right path and choose one with the least resistance. You’ll thank yourself for it.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780374159122">Four Thousand Weeks</a> by Oliver Burkeman 📚</p>
<p>This is one of the most life changing books I have read in a while. It has given me a new way of not just looking at my work, but also life itself.</p>
<h2 id="meaningful-highlights">Meaningful Highlights</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>good luck finding a time management system that makes any room for engaging productively with your fellow citizens, with current events, or with the fate of the environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is an &lsquo;anti hustle culture&rsquo; uprising going on at the moment. All of a sudden people are realising that we do not need to hustle through the best years of our lives and not leave room for things that make us happy. After all what is the point in living if not enjoying it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Productivity is a trap. Becoming more efficient just makes you more rushed, and trying to clear the decks simply makes them fill up again faster.</p></blockquote>
<p>There will always be more work. If you live in a capitalist society and you work for a company that holds the notion they are forced to grow, you are always screwed. Companies expect more and more from their workers, and getting towards the end of your list only leads to more tasks. It is only when you realise that you can only get done what you can the real freedom comes.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no point stressing about getting to the end because modern life is a treadmill you can never get off. Much like inbox zero only leads to more emails, all the modern productivity punchlines just lead to more work. By embracing the fact that the end will never arrive, you can relax, knock as many tasks off as you can and get some downtime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in attempting to eliminate only the tedious experiences, we accidentally end up eliminating things we didn’t realise we valued until they were gone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people must feel as I do that resting and doing atelic tasks are a &lsquo;waste of time&rsquo;. We are encouraged to squeeze every moment for the most return. A return on a later date that may never arrive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where’s the logic in constantly postponing fulfilment until some later point in time when soon enough you won’t have any ‘later’ left?</p></blockquote>
<p>Using your time wisely is the best thing to do. But constantly using it for the benefit of the future is like a hoarder. Keeping everything just incase. The very definition of the word ‘purposiveness’ (using time well for future purposes) but never actually using it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By trying too hard to make the most of his time, he misses his life.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>there’s usually the unspoken fantasy that you might one day finally reach the state of having no problems whatsoever.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find some peoples lives as if they are living a [[Provisional Life]] as if they are preparing for the one that comes next by doing all of these things. Confucius says “We have two lives, and the second begins when we realise we only have one.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zen teacher Charlotte Joko Beck puts it, it’s only unbearable for as long as you’re under the impression that there might be a cure.</p></blockquote>
<p>I like this a lot to our struggles with Luice care. There is not solution or magic bullet to fix it, so there is no point fooling ourselves that anything is ever going to change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The original Latin word for ‘decide’, decidere, means ‘to cut off’, as in slicing away alternatives; it’s a close cousin of words like ‘homicide’ and ‘suicide’.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is why deciding feels painful sometimes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It didn’t take Brown long to figure out that their pulsing sense of urgency was a form of self-medication – something they were doing as a way not to feel something else.</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote from psychotherapist Stephanie Brown who had a practice in Silicon Valley on the 90&rsquo;s hit me hard. Not being able to sit still and rest or enjoy a basic activity is a defence mechanism against being alone with yourself. This is an addict self medicating by distracting instead of intoxicating themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>keep a ‘done list’,</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no better example of this than my task list at work. It is constantly filled with things I need to do. Like the heads of a hydra, as soon as I check one off, there is at least another to take its place. Which is fine, until a certain point where you realise you&rsquo;re on a treadmill with no escape. It starts to feel a bit overwhelming and often leads to a lack of motivation. Pretty quickly, life could become untenable.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s flip the thinking here. Instead of looking at the outstanding tasks, let’s look at the ones already checked off. Focus on a done list rather than a to-do list. Any time I feel a bit overwhelmed by what’s on my plate, not only do I remember there will <a href="/2023/01/30/there-will-always.html">always be more work</a>, but also flip through <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">my Bullet Journal</a> and look at all the crossed off items.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>A few weeks ago a read a post on Mastodon which in essence claimed you can’t do anything on a 256gb MacBook. Ha, I thought. I’m going to teach this person a lesson because I run the design department of my company on a 256gb MacBook Pro. Yet instead I just wrote about it in my journal and carried on with my life.</p>
<p>The truth is you don’t actually need a lot saved on your hard drive, especially in our modern world of Wi-Fi, and external storage options – but I digress.</p>
<p>My initial reaction was to dive in. Make a scene and put my point across. Which seems to be a typical human trait, believing that everyone needs to hear your perspective. We have a tendency to only appreciate the world from our angle. To frame everything with our life experience and give our option thusly. When in reality, no matter how much life experience we’ve had, we have very limited knowledge of the world.</p>
<p>Our ego leads us to believe that the way we see the world is correct. In fact, we need to also press that experience and opinion on everyone who has an opposing view. We suffer from what is referred to on social media as ’main character syndrome’. To believe that we have an over inflated self-importance in the world than we actually do.</p>
<p>To quote the title of the first epic novel by J. Truant “The Universe Doesn&rsquo;t Give a Flying Fuck About You”. The reality is, neither should you. Let’s go all the way back to my example, I have no clue what the person making claims about MacBook HD sizes needs it to do. Maybe they can’t do anything with 256gb of space, but that doesn’t mean I have to tell them off.</p>
<p>Instead, I can just go on with my day and forget about it. The only reason wild generic statements like that feel offensive is because of you. Your ego is fooling you into thinking you need to prove them wrong. When your opinion doesn’t matter to anyone but yourself.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/02/24/for-the-enjoyment.html"><h1 class="p-name">For The Enjoyment Of It</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about some of the things I do and understanding my motivations. I am uncertain if this is because I am nearing 40 and having some kind of crisis. Or that I have recently read 4,000 weeks, but I want to make sure I am getting the most out of the things that I do. Prioritising activities that I enjoy and being more intentional with my time.</p>
<p>Despite having two children to look after, a company to help run, and a whole range of relationships to manage, my life is packed full of activities. Both myself and my wife <a href="/2019/11/20/how-i-use.html">live out of our calendars</a> whilst still maintaining time for our relationship. Enjoyment of our lives is at the centre of everything we do with our kids, so we like to think about the things I do, too.</p>
<p>I stated of course with writing because I do a great deal of it. Not just on my blog, but for my job, <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">for my life</a> and also just because I enjoy it. Either manual scribbling or typing on my keyboard, I love writing. The question always exists of “what is it for”. I scribbled it in my notebook a couple of weeks ago whilst <a href="/2023/02/12/not-sure-if.html">musing other things</a> and tried to come to some kind of resolution on why.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3ae518807f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I am sure you will be saying in your head, “but Greg, you write because you enjoy writing”. Unfortunately, if you’ve read any of my previous posts, you may be able to already expect that a tautology is not good enough for me. I like to question things, and understand myself on deeper levels. When questions arise in my mind, I like to have some kind of reasoning to satisfy the curiosity I have about myself.</p>
<p>I make no money from writing. I don’t do it for clicks, although I do love the interaction it sometimes brings. Nor am I interested in any kind of sudo fame that some bloggers manage to achieve. Indeed, my motivation for writing is completely internal, if my intentions were to gain anything from it externally, then I would have put more effort into actually crafting the art and strengthening my skill by now.</p>
<p>Philosopher Kieran Setiya <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781400888474">refers to atelic activity</a> as one that its value is not derived from its ultimate aim (telos). This is a label that could, without doubt, be applied to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk">my photography</a>. I don’t go out with my camera to provide a result, I do it to see the world differently and enjoy the process. The photographs that are produced are a byproduct of the enjoyment I get from it. Although that <a href="/2022/10/03/taking-the-shot.html">hasn’t always been the case</a> for me.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bed509c085.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>These thoughts gave me some reasoning around simply enjoying the process of writing instead of the result. I love writing out my thoughts and that is enough motivation to do it. Although enough of it takes place in private that hitting publish barely seems worth it at all, the process could be enough. However, much like the photos that make it to the end of my photography process, some enjoyment comes from ‘working in public’. Not for a kind of return, purely to share some of <em>my</em> enjoyment with others.</p>
<p>Dazné <a href="https://dazne.net/make/">summed this up</a> more succinctly than I. “I write foremost for myself. And when others find it useful, then that’s great too”. This <strong>whole post</strong> is me, coming to terms to with my mortality and wanting to understand myself better. If by doing this in public, with a typo ridden blog post, perhaps helps someone else than that&rsquo;s great – but it&rsquo;s not the motivation behind it.</p>
<p>This process has been helped along by what I read, both in books and online, and my reading list has a strange way of surfacing thoughts just when I need them. If my posts do that for someone else and help them understand the world or themselves, then all the better.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For those that are not aware, the <a href="https://gretchenrubin.com/2009/03/happiness-myth-no-8-youll-be-happy-as-soon-as-you/">arrival fallacy</a> is a psychological idea that once you get to a certain place, things will change. There’s a tendency for this to be applied to happiness and usually with purchasing things, but it can be applicable to all sorts of areas. It doesn’t have to be a specific place, it can be a certain level of money you have, and particular time or just a change in situation.</p>
<p>The overriding realisation is that when you <em>do</em> arrive at this place, nothing changes. When you achieve this mythical place, you realise that all the feelings you have angled towards it have been misplaced. No thing, feeling, or situation is going to change your outlook on life nor your position in the world.</p>
<p>Despite knowing about this fallacy for years, I still have a tendency to trick myself into believing it. My subconscious hides away my true motivations and I can become fixated on certain things to change, often non-related things. An easy to explain example is photography and gear acquisition syndrome (GAS). This is a very common thing for photographers, particularly those early in their experience.</p>
<p>GAS tricks you into thinking you need to buy an expensive camera, or high-priced lenses because then you will be able to take great photos. “Just like the people that use it do” you whisper to yourself clicking the buy button, when in fact you should just be out shooting and learning. I had this bad until I <a href="/2022/06/01/keep-it-simple.html">stripped everything back</a> and changed my outlook.</p>
<p>I do this with all sorts of things. <a href="/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html">Notebooks</a> weirdly are my current obsession, and they are all the same right, but that doesn’t stop my brain from fooling me. Convincing me that I need to order this one and that one. What exactly am I going to do then? <a href="/2023/02/11/do-i-even.html">Write more notes</a>? There’s no arrival, there’s no trick to getting to the places you want to be. Like a children’s story, the magic is in you all along.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>You don’t have to tell Me how popular Field Notes are. I buy enough of the to keep the company in business on our own. This has built up over time due to their simple yet elegant design, functionality, and affordability. Not only are they perfect for jotting down notes, ideas, plans, and important information, but they also make great gifts for the stationery lovers in our lives.</p>
<p>Their pocket-sized notebooks are perfect for carrying around, whether it be to a meeting, class, work, or lunch. Their colourful covers make them instantly recognisable, and the fact that they come with helpful features like a ruler and page marker means that they are practical and versatile.</p>
<p>Moreover, their recycled materials and recycled paper option make them both environment-friendly and cost-efficient. They are made by people that really care, making sure they produce the best possible quality at a reasonable price. With each purchase, you are getting not just a purchase to last, but that warm fuzzy feeling that they are made ethically and responsibly.</p>
<p>Field Notes co-founder Aaron Draplin has been collecting memo books for years, and recognises the importance of a pocket notebook. He has his team have created a company that has captured the hearts of Field nuts like us by concentrating on prosecuting great products. See their ‘From Seed’ video below.</p>

<p>The wide range of options allows you to find the perfect notebook for your needs; from the classic notebook to the specialty journals and planners, there is something for everyone. With such a great variety, it can be hard to choose just one, but that&rsquo;s the beauty of it – you can choose the one that best suits you.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>This app is niche. It only works for micro.blog so all of these words I write will only be applicable to a tiny section of readers – but that doesn’t stop this app being great. It really is the perfect micro.blog app and adds in lots of little features to make the experience much better.</p>
<p>Developed by <a href="https://vincentritter.com/">Vincent Ritter</a>, one of the developers working on the micro.blog platform, <a href="https://gluon.app/">Gluon</a> ads on top of the service in so many useful ways. He uses his opinionated but thoughtful skills to craft a whole range of services, such as <a href="https://sublimeads.com/">Sublime adds</a> and <a href="https://shoutouts.lol/">Shoutouts,</a> meaning Gluon is no exception.</p>
<p>What Vincent has done is add in features that really help users of micro.blog out. By listening to the community, he’s able to not only work on the service as a whole, but also build an app to service its users. Features such as customising the way the timeline looks with colours and fonts used mean that you can really make the app yours.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1c45b59161.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Two big features really stand out though. Gluon adds in the ability to mute keywords and I couldn’t be happier. I have struggled with the option to filter out things, particularly American politics, right from the start. An issue that was further exacerbated by being able to follow Mastodon accounts. With Gluon, there’s no more politics in my timeline, nor endless posts about Twitter. Whatever it is that you would rather not see, Gluon powerfully filters out these posts and makes it a much better place to be.</p>
<p>Secondly, Gluon can reply to all. You don’t realise you even need this option until you are involved in an interesting discussion. You are stuck going backwards and forwards copying usernames, whereas Gluon does it all for you. With the added option of removing people from the reply. Sounds so simple doesn’t it, but it’s so helpful.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/71ecc156ea.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Gluon also has all the expected features like the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/micro-blog/id1253201335">official app</a>, but with much more customisation. The controls and navigation of the apps are intuitive and well thought through. The simple interface allows you to reply or see the conversation by swiping the post, and four tabs at the bottom get you to the places you need to go.</p>
<p>There’s something about Gluon that I really enjoy using, and although the 3.0 update of the official app looks great, Vincent’s app seems to be constantly improving. It makes the micro.blog experience much better for me, and I really appreciate its development.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Whenever I am ready to start a new notebook, I get scared. Particularly if it is a nice one. I do this dance with myself where I make excuses not to start it because I would rather not ruin it. Of course, I do eventually start writing in it, and within a very short time it is battered and bruised like all my other ones. Doing its important work until the cycle starts again.</p>
<p>I love notebooks. I always have, even before I was a <a href="/2023/02/11/do-i-even.html">serial notetaker</a>, I loved the idea of having loads of stationary and filing it up with thoughts and ideas. This hardly ever became reality because I never knew what to write to give this delightful new notebook the excellent content it deserved. My hand writing sucks after years of typing everything up in academia and publishing explosively online. Seriously, it’s embarrassing.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e83a925afa.jpg" alt="My current battered Moleskine Cashire after only a few weeks use." title="My current battered Moleskine Cashire after only a few weeks use."></p>
<p>These feelings of dread are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooks/comments/2dernj/i_have_the_new_notebook_dont_want_to_ruin_it/">not exclusive to me</a>. I read numerous posts about people spending money on notebooks and not knowing what to write in them. <a href="/2022/12/31/i-really-want.html">Worrying about making the perfect Bullet Journal</a> setup (me), or wanting to supplement their notes with cute little doodles but not actually being able to draw (also me). When the only thing you can do it ruin it, and do it the justice it deserves.</p>
<p>Matt Christey <a href="https://medium.com/writers-blokke/deliberately-ruin-a-page-of-your-new-notebook-cf2c36becc8a">shares these feelings</a>, with a bit of animosity mixed in. “I hate new notebooks. They’re too perfect. Especially when the paper is nice” he says before systematically ruining a page of every new notebook he buys. By creating one intentional fuck up, this allows him the space to fill the rest of the pages with things that might not work, but won&rsquo;t be as bad as the ruined page.</p>
<p>Starting a new notebook is a bit like standing on the edge of doing something dangerous. There’s a mixture of “I better not mess this up” with a realisation that you actually need to use this thing. As I said the only thing to do is get on a ruin it. A new notebook is made to be used and abused by its owner, otherwise what’s the point?</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/02/12/why-do-people.html"><h1 class="p-name">Why Do People Like Field Notes Notebooks?</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>This question is one of the most common searched for terms and also asked in various ways all over social media. It’s an understandable one, people are fascinated by their dedicated fans. Unfortunately, it is also a question that doesn’t really have a straight answer. Different people like Field Notes for different reasons, but they can usually be summarised by the following.</p>
<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>
<p>Numerous people really enjoy using analogue things, with the use of more tactile products <a href="https://youtu.be/art9LGB16FA">increasing year over year</a>. As such, the way Field Notes acts and feels is critical, and many people agree their quality is great.</p>
<p>This <em>is</em> subjective. Many other brands such as Moleskin have excellent paper too. However, quality often comes out near the top of reasons people like Field Notes notebooks. Their paper is thicker, whiter and nicer to touch than many others.</p>
<h2 id="limited-editions">Limited Editions</h2>
<p>People love to collect things, and Field Notes produce quarterly editions that are limited. They feature an entire range of things including Great Lakes and National parks, as well as often being bright and bold.</p>
<p>Once they run out, they are never printed again and people love that they own a small piece of history and often keep them stored away. You can now even <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/limited-editions">subscribe</a> to make sure you get all the quarterly editions straight to your door.</p>
<p>&lt; bookmark most popular subscriptions &gt;</p>
<h2 id="the-brand">The Brand</h2>
<p>Field Notes have built a brand that people respect and admire. They are not a huge, all encompassing conglomerate, they care about what they make and the people who use them. Often creating editions that <a href="https://fieldnuts.co.uk/a-new-bird-in-town/">give to organisations</a> and events, as well as reflecting a caring personality.</p>
<p>People like Field Notes because the brand represents who they are as a person. The brand works hard to create a look that feels nice and people love that.</p>
<h2 id="innovation">Innovation</h2>
<p>Not often big on the list of a company that makes paper notebooks (and a few other things) but they have often pushed things forward. Editions like the <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/expedition">Expedition</a>, which is almost indestructible, show the care, thought and investment that goes into marking Field Notes notebooks.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Field Notes have built up not just a brand that people love, but a quality product that is worth the investment. They usually cost a little more, but really put the effort into creating a product that people rely on. Many people like Field Notes notebooks and simply wouldn’t use anything else.</p>

      <p>Om Malik <a href="https://om.co/2022/12/09/why-context-matters/">writing about context</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try and find the context. Wherever you can ask as many questions and may slow you down in being able to make a decision that may slow you down and being able to form a take, but maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe we shouldn’t have an opinion immediately. Maybe we should wait and see what happened. See what the context is.</p></blockquote>
<p>The amount of times that I’ve mediated a disagreement that is purely because of the failure to understand the context is far too many. Especially when everything nowadays seems to be written down, the context of the words read can be wildly different than the ones written.</p>
<p>I am not sure what the cause is, but there seems to be a distinct lack of understanding that other people might not think and act like you do. There’s definitely some <a href="https://www.cxomedia.id/human-stories/20220722170529-74-175667/get-to-know-main-character-syndrome">main character</a> delusion going on in the modern world and people can’t see the context and instead seem to look for the argument instead.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When all is said and done, I am not a very good writer. I’m a consistent one, a passionate one, and I’m much better than I used to be. I am still not good at it when compared to people that have spent time crafting their art. That have spent time learning the ways of writing and growing their vocabulary to communicate with ease.</p>
<p>The truth is that anyone can write something passable with enough time to do it, but it takes years to do it well. This is one of the reasons that AI tools like ChatGPT can engineer some words on a page, but can’t communicate the point clearly and passionately. They are pulling in words that have already been written, working out which ones most likely go together given the subject, and churning it out. It gets it right most of the time, but will never fully replace a gifted writer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When students arrive in college, they don’t see writing as a medium of communication … They see it as sort of this engineering task that they’re then going to present to us as examiner and hopefully have us say, ‘Yeah, you did it right.</p></blockquote>
<p>Above is a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/writing-education-language-empathy-ai-chatgpt-age/672999/">quote</a> by English professor Jim Warren, who teaches writing at the University of Texas. This quote sums up perfectly what most people think writing is, a sort of puzzle that can be solved by just placing the right words in the right order. Which indeed it is, in the same way beautiful music is just the right notes in the right order.</p>
<p>It might be technically correct (<a href="https://mashable.com/article/chatgpt-amazing-wrong">it also might not be</a>) and covering all the basic points, but anything produced by the current level of AI tools is hard work. It is often painful, repetitive, and boring. Don’t get me wrong, this could just be a matter of time and computing power, but something tells me that good writers will never be replaced. As I’ve <a href="/2023/02/10/the-next-generation.html">written about previously</a>, creative work is about to be changed forever, but many of the work that is due to be replaced can’t be engineered.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com">Field Notes</a> notebooks are some of the most popular notebooks used by creative professionals and students alike. The company has been producing notebooks since 2007 and has grown in popularity since then. They offer a wide range of limited edition notebooks, which are released quarterly. These editions are highly sought after and often sell out quickly.</p>
<p>The most popular editions of <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com">Field Notes</a> notebooks include the National Parks, Expedition, and Great Lakes series. These editions feature unique covers, interesting paper stocks, and special features like gussets, pocket notebooks, and more.</p>
<p>The National Parks series features some of the most striking designs to date. There are eighteen Memo Books all together in six different 3 packs. These all feature an American National Park uniquely, so if you want them all, it will cost you a fair amount.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bfa9e437f2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Expedition series has a unique orange cover design, but that’s not all, it is the only edition of Field notes that is waterproof. In fact, it’s just about indestructible. Made from <a href="https://yupousa.com">Yupo Synthetic paper,</a> you can’t even tear it. These revolutionary notebooks have even been to the South Pole!</p>
<p>The Great Lakes series features a unique cover design with a blue tint and outlines of America&rsquo;s Great Lakes. This set of five Memo Books each feature Lakes Michigan, Superior, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. With information about that specific law inside the back cover.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/efbb309bc0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Each of these editions has a unique look and feel, making them popular among Field Notes fans. They are also highly sought after, sell out quickly and are not printed again. So if you’re looking to get your hands on one of these editions, it’s best to keep an <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/dispatches">eye on their blog</a> and act fast!</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Have you ever wanted to choose between two quality pocket notebooks, but were unsure of which one to go with? <a href="https://www.moleskine.com/en-gb/">Moleskine</a> Cahier and <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com">Field Notes</a> are some of the best notebooks in the market, but which one should you go for? In this blog post, I will go through all the details, so you can make an informed decision when it comes to Moleskine vs Field Notes.</p>
<p>Both Moleskine and Field Notes are great choices when it comes to notebooks, and they are some of the most popular options out there. They have their similarities, such as their well-made nature, as well as their differences. Moleskine offers a wide variety of sizes, while Field Notes only makes pocket-sized notebooks. Moleskine&rsquo;s covers come in hard, soft, and cardboard, and it has a few types of paper, whereas Field Notes has only one type of cover and different types of paper.</p>
<p>When it comes to size, Moleskine offers many more size options and is the better choice for those looking for larger notebooks. We use may of them here in our writing cave. Moleskin <em>do</em> sell a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cahier-Plain-Pocket-Journal-Black/dp/8883704916/">small version Cashier</a>, which most people compare to Field Notes. The single, pocket-size option, is perfect for those who need something to fit in their pocket.</p>
<p>As for covers, Moleskine offers three main cover options: hard, soft, and cardboard. These are usually sold in block, but particularly with the pocket sized version they do come in blue and a cardboard style brown. If you forget about special editions, Field Notes offers only one basic cover, a light brown cardboard cover similar to a brown paper bag. For a little more money, you can buy Field Notes with in special edition covers, which is what most people really value in the brand.</p>
<p>Both brands have great paper quality and work perfectly with ballpoint pens and pencils, although Moleskine&rsquo;s paper is a bit yellow and Field Notes&rsquo; more white.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something with more variety, Moleskine is the right choice for you. But if you need something that&rsquo;s small and flexible, <a href="https://www.thejournalshop.com/collections/field-notes">Field Notes</a> is your best option. So, when it comes to choosing between Moleskine and Field Notes, it all comes down to what you require in a notebook and what both companies can offer you. Consider the size, covers, and paper types to find out which one suits your needs the best.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’ve started and failed to make notes like I’m told to do by all the productivity content creators out there. It was first Roam Research, then Obsidian (more than once) and most recently Apple Notes. I could never quite put my finger on why because in the few weeks I do manage to keep it up, it really helps.</p>
<p>In the book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781529396508">Happy, Sexy, Millionaire</a> Steven Bartlett discusses his colleague Sophie. She’s a serial gym starter, except she never gets there, she just endlessly talks about going and never goes. As Steven soon concludes, that’s because she doesn’t really want to go to the gym, she wants to be the type of person that goes to the gym. She likes the thought of being fit and healthy, but doesn’t actually want to put in the hard work.</p>
<p>Bringing this back to my serial note-taking thoughts. Do I actually want to take notes to help my creative flow? Or do I in fact just want to appear as the type of person that carries around a notebook. An example that people talk about when they discuss note-taking or people that <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">journal</a>. Is my ego the driving force here instead of my motivation to improve my life?</p>
<p>There’s an important distinction to make here. Because I am certainly not <em>really</em> motivated to <a href="/2020/08/09/i-cant-go.html">ditch my smartphone</a>, but my ego wants me to be the type of person that doesn’t have one. For it to be a personality trait that might make me a bit more interesting than I actually am. The motivation to do things is a strange and often mysterious thing to work out. One that strangely I have come to realise through journaling and being more aware of my thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>There are numerous things that I want to do for one reason or another, but many that don’t stick around very long. Perseverance only goes so far, even when you are really motivated. The underlying root of those things remains important so as not to waste time or effort, but some things are worth the effort.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/02/10/the-next-generation.html"><h1 class="p-name">The Next Generation Of Creative Work</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There’s a lot of talk out there about AI and the future of this, that and the other. The opinions range from creative work is doomed, to “no, this is fine” and many more somewhere between. I am sure you’ve read loads of hot takes – well, here’s mine, and it’s a bit different from most.</p>
<p>I am a creative worker. I run design, marketing, and content for a business and I have been doing it a long time. I’ve seen things come and go, trends grow and fade. The use of AI in, well, absolutely everything, feels different. There’s a reason people are both fascinated and terrified at the same time because this really will be a drastic change. I feel as if we are seeing the next phase of technology evolve before our eyes, and there is a lot to look forward too.</p>
<p>There are some logical fears as well. A genuine worry that platforms like GPT will remove the need for writers, reporters, and even artists. That individuals who have spent years learning their crafts are going to see their job opportunities disappear overnight. The reality is that we are still a very long way from that, but there <em>is</em> a cause for concern.</p>
<p>Undoubtably, some organisations will replace their creative workers with AI. Those are the organisations that are not in their field for the good of the world, just to turn a profit. A bot has been able to cobble together a blog post, or a factual news article for a long while, albeit with a lot of oversight and correction, but as technology improves so too will the output. Those that straight away lean on these tools are not the type of organisation you want to be working for anyway.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b78b79987e.jpg" alt="digital art of a male writer crying onto their laptop by Dall-E"></p>
<p>Those that view a person with experience as expendable, to be replaced by code, are using you as a tool already. They are simply upgrading their tools to the newest available, like a business would anything else it owned. Thankfully, they are still going to need people to do the work for them. There will become a whole market for those that can interact with the AI to create the best possible outcome – and that will be the new creative market worker.</p>
<p>By using the experience from creating, the new creative worker will learn to use AI to make their job easier, rather than resit and lose their job entirely. Crafting prompts and detailed instructions for the AI, putting them together and checking them over afterwards. You may be getting <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F">Midjourney</a> to illustrate the hero image of a blog post about Twitters new crisis, written by the latest iteration of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>. Tweaking the prompt and output as you go to reflect the tone you require and elicit the correct emotional response.</p>
<p>You might be the editor of an online magazine that is prompted to cover a specific company because the traffic would spike. Or an SEO consultant that can use AI to scan a website and improve its ranking based on data from all the readers from the last year. Whatever it may be, you <em>will</em> rely on AI, so embrace it now. There will be reduced need for workers, there’s no getting around this, but those that skill up will become the new full-stack developer unicorn.</p>
<p>Sure, anyone can type into a prompt box and get results. Anyone can search Google and find what they are looking for. It is the next step that yields better results. Knowing the keywords and short codes that will find exactly what you require in a faster time. The new creative will be one that speaks to a developed AI instead of a dumb algorithm.</p>
<p>Charlie Warzel mentioned <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/google-bing-race-to-launch-ai-chatbot-powered-search-engines/673006/">in his excellent piece yesterday</a> that there is already a growing market for those individuals that can coax the very best results from the AI tools available. Being able to sell your understanding and ‘speak’ to the AI tools available is already a viable income. Like the jump from film, to digital and then into the Photoshop era pissed off photographers who didn’t evolve, so too will AI if you’re not onboard.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>As a means of follow up to my post in <a href="/2022/01/04/subscription-creep.html">early 2022</a>, I decided to think about my subscriptions yet again. I’d like to say that things are different now, but it seems worse. Every service seems to have changed to a subscription and those that have already seem to be hiking the prices, some by quite a bit!</p>
<p>There have been some adjustments in my usage and also returns of apps I ditched.</p>
<h2 id="must-haves">Must Haves</h2>
<p><a href="https://ulysses.app/" title="Ulysses">Ulysses</a> - still my favourite wiring app, don’t see this going anywhere, perhaps ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a> - Still don’t pay for it technically, still essential. Nothing will ever replace it, but it costs a fortune. Not interested in replacements.</p>
<p><a href="/2021/12/18/brain-fm-the.html">Brain FM</a> - Never ever giving this up, gets more work done than any other subscription I pay for.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> - I was experimenting last year, and this year it&rsquo;s my blog. Love this service.</p>
<p><a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> - Canceled this last year, but I’ve started <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">journaling in a big way</a>, and it has quickly become a must-have.</p>
<h2 id="changed">Changed</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-one/">Apple one</a> - replaced with the family plan following the price increase. Don’t use News nor Fitness+ so saved £120 a year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> - Still acts as my playground a little and hosts <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk">gregmorris.co.uk</a>, but may ditch this later in the year.</p>
<h2 id="gone">Gone</h2>
<p>Pocketcasts - Replaced with Overcast, purely to save a bit of money.</p>
<p>Netflix - Very little on that make the cost worth it any more.</p>
<p>Headspace - Still meditating, but doing it with some Brain FM background noise. The app became a real chore to use and far too busy.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years I have become really aware of the subscriptions I sign up for and the value they give. I’ve cut around 10 out and saved no end of money. I agree that developers should get the money they deserve but the costs of some really put me off. Glad I did the experiment and cut down my spending.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Over the last few months, I have had a few questions in my working life on how I stay so focused. I have made myself a fairly rigid routine, particularly when working in the office, of putting my headphones on and pumping out work. The weird reason I’m able to do this when seemingly everyone else chats or bangs away answering emails is my acceptance of how distractible I am.</p>
<p>We all have a section of our brain dedicated to instant gratification. People often refer to is as our chimp brain, <a href="https://mo.work/blog/how-to-master-the-habits-of-high-performing-teams/">Dave Brailsford calls it our Lizard brain</a>, it’s the part of us that isn’t interested in anything but itself. It urges you to stop when you’re exercising, it talks you into another slice of cake, and it keeps you scrolling social media. Whatever it desired, if I am not paying attention it’s in charge.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/36aa0d6f1d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The great thing is I have realised this and put things in place to stop it. Trained myself to quieten it down in certain situations and removed the temptations it loves. Once my headphones are on, and I’m <a href="/2021/12/18/brain-fm-the.html">listening to Brain FM</a>, I’m pushed into a kind of flow state and it doesn’t stand a chance. My phone is out the way, I’m in Work Focus mode, and there’s nothing but <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">a notebook</a> by my side.</p>
<p>There are no superpowers going on here. It seems like everything in our modern lives is made into distract us. So, you <em>need</em> to remove them. Phones, apps, web browsers, whatever it is, before long your monkey brain will get its way and whisk you away. Simply by recognising how distractible I am, could I begin to combat it. As soon as I feel the itch I recognise it and push it away, and if it becomes too much I tend to have a walk around for 5 mins. In this time it important to be disciplined, I wouldn’t dare look at my phone!</p>

      <p>There is a new word I learnt a few weeks ago – compersion. It’s vicarious joy, associated with sexual pleasure (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/04/altered-states-love-without-limits-review-louis-theroux-treads-his-tightrope">Louis Theroux taught me it</a> before you ask). It’s used mainly in talk around swinging and polyamorous relationships. However, that’s not what I want to discuss (thank god) but it does relate to what I think my calling in life is.</p>
<p>I struggle to see the point in life. For many years of it I have <a href="/2021/03/30/the-thought-of.html">been in pain</a> and for a long time have questioned what the end goal is. I&rsquo;m a creature of habit and strive for structure and routine, but often feel like I’m living in a never-ending cycle looking for the exit route. Endlessly searching for the point in all this, and maybe because I’m getting on a bit I’ve started to look harder.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cb131e0661.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This has been the topic of my <a href="/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html">journaling</a> and my notes. I’ve been reading and watching so much about the topic that Google must think I’m having a breakdown. Perhaps I am, but I think I’ve cracked it. I think the whole reason I am here is the vicarious enjoyment I get from improving other people lives.</p>
<p>I’ve become a little obsessed in leaving a legacy. I won’t be able to leave trust funds or investments, I just want to leave behind memories of a great guy. When I’m gone, I want people to think “he was a great guy that Greg”. That’s it.</p>
<p>I enjoy other people trusting me enough to come to me for advice. I love going out of my way to help people with chores or issues or anything really. I get my kicks from seeing other people smile. If there is an all powerful creator they 100% put me here to help other people. Sure, I get enjoyment from technology and other stuff, but improving other people’s lives is my drug!</p>
<p>I think I’m doing a pretty good job, but there’s always more to do. Perhaps now I know myself a bit more, I can go even further.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Yesterday, myself and my wife celebrate 14 years of being together. It’s not as long as some people, but we’ve been so far together that it feels like a lifetime. We’ve had ups and downs in our time together, but we’ve always remained strong and grow closer together all the time.</p>
<p>I know everyone says this about their other half (maybe not <em>everyone</em>) but I feel so lucky to have found her. We are in many ways polar opposites, a minimalist vs a maximalist, but seem to be the Yin to each other&rsquo;s Yang.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f7c279b15c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s not all ups in fact, we’ve had a lot of downs, but we deal with the downs together. Raising two wonderful kids, dealing with all of Lucie’s hospital appointments and social care needs as best we can.</p>
<p>The best thing is that my wife makes me a better person. That’s all I can wish for in a person. Someone that loves and cares for me, but also challenges me and pushes me forward. My biggest fan and also the person who keeps me grounded. I love this woman with all my heart. ❤️</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/02/02/bring-back-the.html"><h1 class="p-name">Bring Back The iPhone Battery Case</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> has allowed more innovative things to come out than I imagined. It’s become more than the pointless plug that was introduced alongside the iPhone 12. Apple built a pretty great range of accessories. It’s bound to be improved upon over the years, but before that happens, can we please go back to the iPhone battery case.</p>
<p>Before everyone yells at me to tell me how horrible it looks, I get it. It was ugly, heavy and a bit of a nightmare to get in your pocket – but the iPhone battery case sold alongside iPhone from 7 to 11 was an excellent solution. It is an exceptional application of function over form and far exceeds the usefulness of the current MagSafe battery.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e031179b13.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>For around £130 you could boost the battery of your iPhone by around 80%. This depended on your usage, but by using one on my iPhone 7 I could double the battery life easily and also have a case around my phone at all times. Admittedly, this wasn’t the nicest case in the world. Made from a very grippy rubber that seemed to pick up pocket lint like it couldn’t bare to be away from it – it still kept your phone protected.</p>
<p>The MagSafe battery pack in comparison costs around the same as the old battery case, but doesn’t function nearly as well. Arguably it is a more elegant solution, you can slap the battery pack on as and when required instead of carrying around the battery all day. With the MagSafe magnets keeping it attached to the back of your iPhone 12/13 or 14. However, in reality it barely clings to the phone, and you have to handle it with care to actually keep charging your phone.</p>
<p>There is no case to keep the battery pack attached to the back of your phone, leading to loss of charge and a much less economical way to charge your phone. By using wireless charging to charge the phone instead of the Lightning method used by the battery case, the MagSafe battery pack gives you around another 40-60% charge. Possibly more, but the rate and level of charge is dictated far more by phone usage and temperature.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c2988de66f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Should you need to recharge your MagSafe battery pack, it needs to be plugged into Lightning, thus kind of defeating the whole point of it. You can’t wirelessly charge the wireless battery, but you <em>can</em> charge both at the same time, albeit very slowly. The battery case does require the same Lightning charging, but charges both your phone and your battery at the same time and much quicker than MagSafe. With no issues with loss of connectivity nor heat.</p>
<p>I also think the case is a much more pleasing solution than the white battery stuck to the back of your phone. The battery case was not the nicest looking case in the world, far from it, but the MagSafe Battery is much worse. It doesn’t fit to the back of the phone very well and, although it arguably looks OK on an iPhone Mini, it looks ridiculous on the iPhone Pro Max versions.</p>
<p>What they both do have going for them however is excellent support built into iOS itself. Being able to see the charge of both batteries at glance makes them both much better options than many third-party versions. If Apple sold a separate case to fit over both phone and battery pack, the MagSafe battery would be much more usable, but frankly they should just go back to using the battery case full stop.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I know what you’re thinking, yet another put down post for my pet hate social media site, but no. There’s some praise this time, kind of. The truth is, there is nowhere else that’s quite like Twitter. I can <a href="/2022/11/16/some-small-thoughts.html">muse all I like</a> about what brands should be doing, but if you’ve got an issue, and you want it resolving – doing it in public on Twitter usually gets results.</p>
<p>For the last few days, I’ve been trying to get my company sorted on a business plan with <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft</a>. It’s not my favourite app in the world, but I tried loads with the team, and it was the most rounded for what we needed. Unfortunately, the sign-up has been less than smooth, so I reached out to them via their preferred email method and waited. Two days passed by, and baring in mind I was waiting for to spend money, I received no reply.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dd1ad01c8d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There is something to be said about my confidence levels in their product now, and I’m frustrated. So, I did the only thing I could think of, logged into Twitter for the first time in months to tweet at them. In minutes, I have a reply from the co-founder Viktor and an email address to contact him.</p>
<p>The issue is not resolved yet, and I’m not far way from walking away instead, but this shows the power that Twitter has. Nowhere else can you do this with brands and get your issue sorted. This isn’t unique to Craft, I’ve done it numerous times over the years and sorted numerous issues all on Twitter – via a quick tweet and usually a follow-up by DM.</p>
<p>The chance of this being possible on Mastodon is frankly slim to none. Although I still hold up hope that the same activity could be replicated, I think that we would have started to see movements by now. There’s just something about Twitter that, I doubt, could be replicated elsewhere.</p>

      <p>Josh Ginter <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2023/01/30/im-back-in-the-plus-club/">shared some thoughts on returning to Plus Club</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pro Max’s larger, more comfortable keyboard means I can bang out responses a little quicker and hone in some of my more focused Mac-time to truly productive work rather than email responding.</p></blockquote>
<p>Should I believe that everything happens for a reason, I would start to think the universe wants me to have a big phone again. Over the weekend, I had a long chat with good friend <a href="https://darylbaxter.com/">Daryl Baxter</a> and talked about an iPad Mini for content consumption. Only after remembering the price of the new mini did I consider the potential benefits of having a bigger phone instead.</p>
<p>In my <a href="/2021/08/26/minimalism-and-big.html">self reasoning post</a> from 2021 I argued that if you want one device the biggest you can get make sense. There are huge advantages to have a big phone for typing, watching content and interacting with it – most people only see the downsides. Which tare considerable when you consider the weight and sheer size of the Max models of iPhone.</p>
<p>With that said, I used the 13 Pro Max for most of last year and enjoyed being able to type out blog posts easily, edit photos enjoyably and generally get along a bit better when I needed to use my phone. It’s when it’s not in use that the downsides become obvious. That budge in my pants is the camera bump, I’m not pleased to see you!</p>
<p>As I become more <a href="/2022/11/18/apple-watch-ultra.html">reliant on my Apple Watch</a> and only have my phone on me when it’s unavoidable, it makes sense to have the best one that does the small tasks well. Writing, reading, watching a film on the elliptical all lend themselves to jointing the Max Club again.</p>
<p>Damn it, I think I just talked myself into it.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’ve tried several times to articulate my feelings on <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a>, but failed every time. Sometimes frustratingly so because I think a lot of my problems relate to things I feel when using it. Don’t get me wrong it works great, and some features are really well done, it just doesn’t feel like it wants me to enjoy reading.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5426bd7384.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So, I’m stuck trying to pin down thoughts on sometimes ephemeral feelings provoked by an app. You can’t measure and compare feelings, but you know when they just don’t push your buttons. In contrast to <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/">Matter</a> that I have been using as my read it later app for quite a while, it feels strange. With all its straight edges and <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2013/05/06/android-what-does-holo-mean/">hollo like colours,</a> it always strikes me as industrial.</p>
<p>It feels like it is made to <a href="/2022/04/10/reading-doesnxt-need.html">hack my reading</a>. I can swipe this way and that way, highlighting until my heart&rsquo;s content. Optimised to get through my queue as quickly and as easy as possible by pushing me towards using keyboard shortcuts, recommending highlights and archiving everything for use later on. If I’m too busy to even read the article, I can ask AI to summarise it for me, and even write talking points on it.</p>
<p>If that’s your thing, and I believe it is for many people, this app is great. There are loads of options and what seems like a never-ending series of screen options. It’s just not for me, and that’s OK. Matt Birchler did an really great overview of its features and you can check it out below. I’d highly recommend a subscribe to Matts channel too, it’s one of my favourites.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZTYCA73I5uQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>For a reading app, I think it’s important to make reading the most important factor. Everything else should get out of the way, with intuitive and easy to reach controls. Otherwise, you’re in danger of creating a busy environment that leads to an overwhelming feeling once articles build up.</p>
<p>I am currently still using both Readwise and Matter for different reasons. Reader to fly through my subscribed feeds and work related newsletter reading, and Matter to relax whilst catching up on my saved articles. With them both being premium services, and reasonably expensive ones at that, this can’t continue once my free trial is up. There are no difficult decision to make for me, but I love that Reader exists. Both to push Matter forward and to offer alternatives for people that need different things. If you’re in the market, it’s worth checking out.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Like most people I know, I am constantly worried about getting through my task list. At times in the last couple of years I’ve been absolutely buried with no way out. I’m always desperate for ways to maximise my time and ‘hack’ my way to getting more done. Judging by half of the YouTube videos I am suggested, I am not the only one, but there <em>is</em> a surprising fix.</p>
<p>I must preface this post by saying that these thoughts are 100% inspired by the brilliant book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780374159122">4,000 weeks</a> by Oliver Burkeman. A book I descovered by complete accident after stumbling on some of his <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/posts">blog posts</a>. There’s also a certain amount of presumption going on here, we don’t all control our task lists, but we can all control the way we approach them. So, I feel as if there are loads of areas of life that these general thoughts can be applied to.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e9c77aa777.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When it comes to work, it isn’t often the actual tasks that cause the issues. It is the stress of having so much to do and never enough time to do it. The way of the world seems to be stuffing more and more things into less and less time. It doesn’t matter if the things you have to get done are decided externally or your deadlines are internal, the end of your task list will <strong>never</strong> come.</p>
<p>There will always be more work to do. Things that you could get done, and jobs that are waiting for gaps in your time. Companies expect more and more from their workers, and getting towards the end of your list only leads to more tasks. It is only when you realise that you can only get done what you can the real freedom comes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you still under the illusion that you&rsquo;ll one day reach a point in your life where you no longer have any problems? — Sam Harris</p></blockquote>
<p>There is absolutely no point stressing about getting to the end because modern life is a treadmill you can never get off. Much like “inbox zero” only leads to more emails, all the modern productivity punchlines just lead to more work. By embracing the fact that the end will never arrive, you can relax, knock as many tasks off as you can and get some downtime.</p>
<p>No revelation will happen, but the freedom from feeling guilty for the tasks you complete just leads to a happier life. It might lead you to get better work done, too.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There appears to be a collective belief that the world of blogging is changing. It is true that we are living in an era where Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is transforming the way content is produced. I’m just not convinced that it will change the way I, or most people I know, blog. Mainly due to the reasons why most people blog being entirely different to those of content farms doing it for income.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no denying that platforms like Chat GPT could make it easier and more efficient for me to create content. That content could allow me to be more targeted, engaging, and interactive, but there in lies the issue. Ask any AI to create a blog post, and it will churn out SEO optimised, un-personal content full of basic facts. There won’t be any feeling or thought-provoking statements. It won’t feel like me.</p>
<p>AI uses (NLP) algorithms to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This technology allows the user to craft content based on various factors, so in theory I could create blog posts based on my understanding how my audience interacts with my blog. Refining posts to better meet their needs. That just isn’t blogging though, is it.</p>
<p>The prediction is that I could go deep in the weeds and start personalising content to each individual reader. By recognising the topics, my readers are most interested in and the types of content they prefer, AI could deliver more relevant, personalised content to keep them engaged. Automating the creation process as we go. No more writing, editing nor publishing. Blog posts would be created based on keywords or topics with little to no input.</p>
<p>Does that sound like blogging to you because it certainly doesn’t for me. What AI will create is a stark difference between people writing on their website and companies doing it for money. The whole point of blogging is writing and expressing yourself. No AI can do that, nor will they ever because being involved in the process is the entire point.</p>
<p>A blog post is like a conversation between a writer and a reader. You can tell when the post has been crafted and constructed using experience and thought. It hasn&rsquo;t been pumped out for clicks. Unfortunately, as tools become easier to use, like those built into <a href="https://www.notion.so/product/ai">Notion</a> and <a href="https://www.craft.do/blog/craft-assistant-future-ai">Craft</a>, bloggers may take the easy route, but at that point they won&rsquo;t be bloggers any more.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There are not many things that improve my life straight away any more. Meditation did exactly that around 6 years ago, and now journaling is doing the same thing. You read that right, me, journaling. After all my dismissive posts and words over the years of not knowing or wanting to write in one. I’ve got to admit, it’s quite remarkable.</p>
<p>I realise that it is only the end of January, and it’s easy to exaggerate the benefits before the novelty has worn off, but hear me out. I also might be preaching to the choir a bit here, as many people that I follow are already proponents, but I’ll talk about it regardless. This isn’t a New Year’s resolution, but more like a reevaluation, one that I <a href="/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html">talked about before starting out</a>. I paid up for a year of Day One to see what happens, it also went to the store and bought some journals too. This is a journey split into two parts.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/230ac89cf0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="day-one">Day One</h2>
<p>A long journey starts with a single step, and that tiny little movement forward was actually posting to Day One. I’ve <a href="/2022/12/28/outside-of-twitter.html">had it installed</a> on my phone more times that I care to remember, but struggled to write much. Instead of spending any money on this crazy idea I had, I made myself start writing at least one post a day electronically. It was a little test for me that I had to complete for me to gain the reward of any expenditure.</p>
<p>After the first couple of day of writing, frankly nonsense, each morning, I could see the difference. By not expending too much mental energy and letting my fingers type out exactly what I was thinking about and feeling with no prompts, I literally kick-started my day. I felt happier, more relaxed and resolved my thoughts first thing in the morning. After just <a href="/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html">5 days I stumped up</a> and bought Premium because I knew straight away I was on to a <a href="/2023/01/09/day-streak.html">winning idea</a>.</p>
<p>Now 29 days in, I’ve posted consistently at least once a day as early as I get time. This is a <a href="https://littlecoffeefox.com/morning-pages-changed-life/">morning pages</a> of sorts, a literal brain dump of everything swirling around in my head. I have often followed this up with smaller thoughts and any other things that I am thinking about. It took effort and went slowly at first, with great trepidation.</p>
<p>Whenever I get a feeling or a thought, I reach for Day One now and just type it out to see where I get to. Some of these turn into blog posts, but most don’t. They are just for me, and I probably won’t read them again. Just knowing they are there is enough to make me feel better. I would love to do this manual with a pen and paper, but the thought of it being accessible by others terrifies me. Not because I have anything to hide, but it’s embarrassing to think of someone else reading my thoughts.</p>
<p>Due to how well this small step went, I treated myself early and bought a bullet journal, thus starting the second step of my transformation.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1a3abb569c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="bullet-journal">Bullet Journal</h2>
<p>A massive experience that paid off. That’s the way I’m describing my bullet journal that is constantly open on my desk or in my hand being carried from meeting to meeting. Where I once sit typing away into my MacBook, I’m now writing into my bullet journal and people are noticing the difference.</p>
<p>On the surface, I know that I shouldn’t be using a manual bullet journal for task planning and note taking. It makes no sense, as I’ve <a href="/2022/12/31/i-really-want.html">covered before</a>, <a href="/2022/06/21/putting-a-system.html">more than once</a>. It’s often redundant, takes more work and isn’t searchable. I realise when a spend so much time at a computer or with a phone, it makes sense to use digital tools. Yet writing things out manually, being intentional about things, and just flipping through pages ignites something in me.</p>
<p>It is as if the physical act of bullet journaling stimulates me more. I remember more things, take more notes, manage and plan things better. There appears to be no downsides. Well, perhaps the slightly precarious position that all physical things are in. Bar loosing my book, or not having it with me, it’s all positives.</p>
<p>To combat this slightly, I’ve adopted a ‘Field Notes’ notebook that’s usually in my back pocket, just in case. Mine is actually a Moleskin version, but most people are more accustomed to what Field Notes looks like. This is perhaps the most significant change in my life and one many people have commented on. I’ll admit it’s a little weird, but it helps me live a much more intentional life, and is another solution to <a href="/2022/02/10/the-ultimate-minimalist.html">my life becoming phone free</a>.</p>
<p>Seen something worth thinking about. Make a note. Heard something on a podcast that I want to research later. Make a note. Thought about a peculiar thing that you would like to find the answer to. Make a note. Seriously. Yesterday I wrote in my field notes “what is the psychological theory why you see new things all the time”. Turns out I was thinking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion">frequency illusion</a> or the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon. Could I have found this out with a quick Google on my phone, of course, but I would have forgotten it as quickly as I looked it up.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6f3b7d74bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The physical act of writing something down improves my memory of it - <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2021.634158/full">it’s science</a>! Yet, every person I mention this too seems blown away by manual writing things down. Is it a bit of a pain transferring things if I want to write about them or research them later, yes. That’s the point though. I can review all the notes I make, and think about them several times, with a quick flick through my field notes. Leading to better retention, more ideas and more awareness of my thoughts.</p>
<p>For me there is often a tendency to preach about a new practice that has yielded results too early. So I have tried to put off writing about this for a while. There’s often a turning point at the start of the year, even if you don’t make resolutions per se, just to decide to do things a bit differently. However I am well past January 14th which is <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2022/01/17/have-you-quit-your-new-years-resolution-by-quitters-day/">quitters day</a>, and don’t see these new practices changing.</p>
<p>I think there are more <a href="/2022/12/31/manual-practices-to.html">manual things</a> that I can bring in to aid my digital life. As I said, intellectually I know that perhaps leaning on apps is the way to go, but emotionally and mentally writing things down and ticking things off fulfils me more.</p>

      <p>Derek Kedziora writing about <a href="https://derekkedziora.com/notes/20230128090757">giving up alcohol</a> a few months also.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was never a daily drinker, but I was always had one beer too many at parties and heavily relied on a bit of alcohol for confidence and getting through awkward social situations.</p></blockquote>
<p>After drawing back and consuming much less for a while, it’s been a little over a month since I decided to give up alcohol. I had written a long post about this, but read Derek’s post above yesterday, and it distilled most of my thoughts into a paragraph.</p>
<p>In the UK, alcohol consumption has a strange place in society. It’s seen as something you just do as an adult. Stressed, get a beer. Feel a bit down, get a beer. Want to have fun, alcohol is involved somewhere. Even though I’ve never had an issue with alcohol, this is where <em>my</em> issue is. It’s an avoidance technique to dealing with difficult feelings and isn’t the solution.</p>
<p>So, I feel better. My mental health is better. I’ve lost a bit of weight and I just feel better in myself. I’ve had just two drinks since Boxing Day and I feel great.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For at least a couple of years, I’ve had <a href="/2020/11/21/the-iphone-line.html">an iPhone problem</a>. Well, it’s not Apple&rsquo;s fault, it’s mine, so I guess it’s more of a me problem. With iPhones. The problem is (that is my issue, not Apples) that there are too many iPhones, and I wish we could just go back to one version.</p>
<p>I write regularly about wanting to <a href="/2020/08/09/i-cant-go.html">go back to not having a smartphone</a>. I also write fairly regularly about my justification of <a href="/2021/08/26/minimalism-and-big.html">having a huge iPhone</a>. That’s because I am a walking paradox. I know intellectually what is best for me, but I also have crippling FOMO, so I go around in circles.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/272bc58a76.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I often think I need a smaller phone. Or a bigger one. Or no phone at all. What I always want is the opposite of what I have. Because I’ve fallen for the fallacy that a specific thing will change everything. Almost like the <a href="https://notes.gr36.com/provisional-life">provisional life</a> that Swiss psychologist Marie-Louise von Franz proposes. I am convinced that once I have the other version of this thing, <em>then</em> I’ll have the device I’m happy with.</p>
<p>There once was a magical time when Apple produced one iPhone, I bought that and used it for a year until the new one came out. Then came a plus version that I deliberated on a bit and usually bought the big version. Now I have (if I include last year&rsquo;s mini version) five to choose from. Well, 4 really because no one wants an iPhone 14 plus.</p>
<p>All with their advantages and disadvantages, not to mention various price points. Giving customers excellent choice. Which means that someone always has the version you don’t and the grass always seems greener to someone like me. Even after years of knowing that I have this issue, I still haven’t solved it. Despite all the minimalism mantras and deep thinking, my issue with iPhone remains, and it could be an issue forever.</p>

      <p>Luke Harris on his blog, writing about <a href="https://www.lkhrs.com/blog/2022/11/twitter/">social media as a whole</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m on Mastodon, but I’m bored with what I call “the timeline era”. Scanning an unending stream of disconnected posts for topics of interest is no longer fun, I prefer deciding what to read based on titles, or topic-based discussion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before I start, I need to point out, early enough in my post, that I understand all the benefits of Mastodon. I don’t need you to yell at me that I “don’t get it” like you did when I criticised the onboarding process.</p>
<p>Mastodon promises to be a much better place than Twitter because of the way it is set up. But as it gets busier and busier, and <a href="https://social.lol/@birchtree@mastodon.social/109756966498236415">popular users start to struggle </a>like they did on Twitter. It becomes more and more apparent to me that it’s only a matter of time before it suffers very similar issues.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s not going to shove terrible content in your face for engagement, but the main feed is far too busy now to enjoy. Without some kind of filtering and algorithm, Mastodon is frankly impossible to follow. Not to mention the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-reply-guys">reply guys</a> are there, with all their <a href="/2021/06/11/but-what-about.html">“what about”</a> tendencies.</p>
<p>I was expecting more from <a href="/2021/01/11/social-media-in.html">social media in 2021</a>, and I’m still waiting for something better. The problem is, as Luke covers in his post, snacking on the internet and trying to follow a never-ending stream of disconnected post is ultimately unfulfilling.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I give myself a hard time about the things I do and getting the most out of my short time in this mortal coil. I obsess over things like <a href="/2022/12/20/overthinking-social-media.html">social media usage</a>, <a href="/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html">writing practices</a> and lots more I don’t write about. It does get me down some times, but here’s the thing, I am confident I put thought into the right things.</p>
<p>Sure, I might occasionally spend too much time comparing <a href="/2021/03/19/looking-for-my.html">writing apps</a> or to-do tasks but, in the main, the things I put thought into are important. As Oliver Burkeman <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780374159122">points out</a> in great detail, our life on in this pace is limited to about 4,000 weeks. If it takes me time and a bit of mental energy to decide I want to avoid looking at social media as often as my chimp brain wants to. For me, that’s good time spent. Deciding what I am happy with and is correct going forward.</p>
<p>I think it <em>is</em> critical to think about the things you do if they are to make a large impact. Obsessing over details that will save time, money, energy are the best things to worry about. Spending time worrying about what blogging platform to use, or what reading app gets your money is arguably a different thing all together, but we’ve all been there.</p>
<p>Only you personally know whether these things are important to you or not. The unfortunate thing is that you only really find out what’s significant from experience. I hate to think of the amount of time I’ve wasted tweaking CSS or building themes for my blog that didn’t really matter — but I enjoyed every moment. I learnt things, and broke things, and I picked up skills in the process.</p>
<p>Any other person on the planet though would probably class that as wasted time. They would look at me weirdly that I spent a good few weeks thinking hard about social media usage, when they don’t give it a second thought. What I think is important is unique to me. I would view my tinkering completely differently if I wanted to be a real writer. Perhaps I should have spent it <a href="/2020/08/17/sitting-in-the.html">sitting in the chair</a> and learning the craft.</p>
<p>They do say that perfection is the enemy of progress. At some point you <em>do</em> have to stop worrying about the how’s and the why&rsquo;s and get going. Doing the things you set out to do and sticking to it. If that’s the case, you’re not thinking about important things any longer. You need to start moving forward instead of getting in your own way.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The posts I write do not disappear into the recesses of my mind, I think about them often. My thoughts and feelings often change over time, but when it comes to my attitudes towards work, I’ve remained fairly fixed for years. Whereas the general perception of work has had a major culture shift, accelerated by the pandemic, and one that is great for the world. Hustle culture and working because that’s what you’re supposed to do has been replaced by a desire for more.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5904fd6f64.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As the post points out, you shouldn’t be working for anything else but yourself. Not in the sense that we should all have our own businesses, that would be great too. More in the sense that you should want to do the work or the tasks you do. It might seem like meaningless tautology, but the importance of stressing that “You make the job; it doesn’t make you” is vital.</p>
<p>At the root of every position you take should be a root desire for you. It doesn’t matter what that desire is, nor the way it manifests itself. It should be something that fulfils you. Emotionally. Spiritually. Furthermore, it is at this point I must bring up the excellent words of Patrick Rhone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I were paid to dig ditches, I would discover that the ditch is for a water line to a new house that means someone gets clean water. Once I think it through, I can find my passion in the ditch digging. - <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/profit-and-passion/">Patrick Rhone</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. You can still have a job, it be a job, and you don’t need to be excited by it, nor it reflect anything about you. However, I would bet that you can find something in it to be excited about, but even so that job isn’t you. You are not your job, you are a person, and your job should be how you make money to be that person.</p>
<p>I’m one of the lucky ones. I have a job I enjoy, and it lifts me up as a person. It is still not me. Unfortunately, not many people are as lucky as I. To leave you with one take away, a distillation of all of these words down to a few, it is to remember “You are not the work you do; you are the person you are”.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/01/15/i-tried-to.html"><h1 class="p-name">I Tried To Hack Podcasts And It Made Me Hate Them</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Around this time two years ago, I decided that there was a whole medium I need to get more out of, Podcasts. I spent a lot of my time listening to them whilst driving, walking the dog and many other things. Listening to some fascinating shows, but I never took much away from them apart from surface level enjoyment. So, I decided I needed to hack them like <a href="/2020/08/22/my-reading-flow.html">I did with reading</a> and start to make notes against all the points I found interesting. I was wrong.</p>
<p>First things first, there is something to be said for taking notes from a podcast. Perhaps not every podcast (maybe ignore most of the points made on Joe Rogan, for example) but many that I listen to are information dense, and I sometimes think that I’d like to learn more about this. With that said, with the ability to note everything down, and have it synced over into an app ruined a lot of the experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b13c41cd83.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Not only was I triple clicking my AirPods like crazy (that’s the shortcut to save a clip in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/airr-audio-conversations/id1355926315">podcast app Airr</a>) I was missing the whole point of listening frequently. Due to the volume of notes I was making, the actual process of saving and going over them later was untenable. When you note everything, it misses the point of note-taking completely. If everything becomes a note, then nothing does.</p>
<p>Not to mention that podcasts became something to concentrate on and worry whether I should have noted that last statement or not. Constantly reminding and listening again to see if I got the point, rather than consuming something in the background whilst doing a more important task. It didn’t take me very long to burn out and not want to listen to anything any more.</p>
<p>Much <a href="/2022/04/10/reading-doesnxt-need.html">like reading</a>, for me, some activities don’t need to be hacked to get the most out of them. They are downtime or a background content to passively consume. When I need to take notes I will every now and again, using Siri or <a href="/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html">Apple notes</a> and that suits me fine. I’ve only just returned to listening to them again because I tried too hard to make the most out of podcasts, and it made them suck. Don’t make the same mistake.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Over the last few days, I’ve been reading a lot about the rediscovery of minimalism. This is 100% because of the circles I move in, but a few people around me are discussing similar thoughts and ideas that I have currently. Finding more value in having less stuff and getting back to basics.</p>
<p>I can honestly say that the original Minimalism film on Netflix, before they remade it in 2020, changed my life. It followed these two guys that I’d never heard off through their journey of spreading the ideas that turned their life around. It features some wonderful people like <a href="https://micro.blog/patrickrhone">Patrick Rhone</a> that opened my eyes to a life of enjoying experiences and people, not things.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2594bbb177.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Somewhere in the following months and years, there was a transformation in the way minimalism was portrayed. The people I followed and looked up to changed. It became like a cult of people that waved their flag of how little they had. The message became a constant cycle of telling you to sell your bed, or they were selling you stuff. Much like <a href="https://ctmiller.net/2023/01/03/minimalism-maybe.html">CT Miller</a> I fell off when minimalists were constantly trying to sell me their Patreon, or their course, or whoever else they could flog. As he puts it, “as minimalism began to dovetail with financial planning and whole food health claims, I got off the bus”.</p>
<p>Minimalism was no longer a way to live a happier life by letting go of things. It was a way to make money and virtue signal at every point along the way. A cult with arguably a good message, but a cult all the same. Those that had given up their jobs to spread the word, had run out of things to say. Minimalism is a pretty simple message, after all. So, they began to give out advice on everything and anything, like a Christian preacher that begs for donations, it ruins the message along the way.</p>
<p>The evolution was from minimalism, the way to look at the world and enjoy more things. To minimalism being a marketing angle. This happened with mediation, mindfulness and numerous other words before it. But flipping the message of less into a way to sell you things was truly disgusting.</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> still true voices out there, though. It is those that are causing this new wave of minimalism. Writers like <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/">Patrick</a> are an inspiration to people like me and helping make my life a better place. There’s true value in living with fewer things and appreciating people much more than stuff, but you have to work a bit more to find them.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Hello all. You may not have even noticed, but I’ve <a href="/2023/01/12/im-going-off.html">taken a short break</a> way from being online. Stresses and strains on my life have meant that I haven’t had much time to be my usual self on the internet, both in time and temperament.</p>
<p>I first noticed this towards the start of the week that I wasn’t in the best frame of mind and didn’t want my negative attitude to affect my posts or replies. I’ve let this happen before when Twitter poked and prodded at me to cause an emotional reaction, but learnt to deal with it is much better now.</p>
<p>It’s remarkable the different the way you feel impacts the way you think and react to things. Being mindful of emotions is important, and often having to save all my mental energy for important decision or deep work in my day job means I am exhausted when it comes to posting and replying online. For better or worse I truly value what I do around the internet and as such a step back is what I (and possibly many people) need every now and again.</p>
<p>What I thought was solely down to manipulation of emotions and my attention by social media companies runs much deeper than I first realised. However, the fact remains that social media companies work hard to pull on these strings and keep users interacting with their service. Emotions breed interaction. Mastodon, and in my case specifically through micro.blog, is a much nicer place for me to hang out. That doesn&rsquo;t mean there are not issues caused by the <a href="/2022/12/01/snacking-on-the.html">constant stream of updates</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of the negativity. It’s only when I step back and don’t post do I realise how much I miss it. I get overly worried about being connected all the time, but it provides a considerable benefit to me. Not only that, but I’m lucky to have found numerous great people that interact with me. Thanks for being wonderful.</p>

      <p>Matthias Ott predicting 2023 is <a href="https://matthiasott.com/notes/the-year-of-the-personal-website">The Year of the Personal Website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your personal website is a place that provides immense creative freedom and control. It’s a place to write, create, and share whatever you like, without the need to ask for anyone’s permission.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of the main reasons I started my blog. I had been writing for other peoples for a long while, providing tech news sites with 4–5 posts a day for free, but wasn’t allowed to write about what I want to. My writing wasn’t an expression of me, it felt like being exploited.</p>
<p>So, a created a personal website. Something that could reflect me. It linked out to the posts I was still writing for other sites, but also mixed in photos, personal thoughts and everything else I wanted to post. It was my place on the internet, and in many ways it was <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>Since 2012 I’ve never stopped blogging. Unfortunately, back then I wasn&rsquo;t really concerned about my posts, so when I moved or decided to change things I pruned older things and ones I didn’t like. So many of my words are lost, <a href="/2018/04/04/wheres-my-name.html">many don’t have my name on any more</a>, but lots and lots are still here.</p>
<p>I won’t lose any of them again. Nor will I give them to other websites to monetise for their gain, or get drawn into the worst if of the worst on display. There have been many years that blogging is “coming back” but it <a href="https://cdevroe.com/2023/01/11/blogging-is-alive">never left</a>. This year more than any other, it might be true though. We’re dusting off our personal websites and making the internet ours again. My origin story will be different to all others, and some people will be starting right now. I can’t wait to see what we build together, with our blogs.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’ve never been a fan of black and white photos. Not in the sense that I don’t like them, I’m just not drawn to them, and they don’t speak to me as much as some people. My wife, on the other hand, is obsessed with black and white. Shooting in it constantly, or editing all of our photos into monochrome afterwards. Every single photo print that is up in our house I’ve had to edit into monochrome to her tastes, and until now, it’s been frustrating.</p>
<p>I have no idea what flipped in my head at the weekend, but I just decided to go out and shoot in black and white. I found a really <a href="https://fujixweekly.com/2022/12/28/ilford-fp4-plus-125-fujifilm-x-t5-x-trans-v-x-trans-iv-film-simulation-recipe/">nice film recipe that emulated old Illford film</a> and <a href="/2023/01/08/no-idea-why.html">off I went</a>.</p>
<p>Since doing so, I’ve shot so many basic things that have been transformed to show much more in the photo. By switching to black and white, the images show so much more drama. Not to mention, I feel like I’m stepping back in time to one much simpler than now. The below shot is straight from camera jpegs whilst walking the dog to try to show what I mean. It’s boring, but appealing.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/96bfbdea86.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I love the noise, the creamy colours and the texture of the leaf. There’s just something about black and white that I’ve failed to notice so far. Perhaps it’s because I’m shooting <em>in</em> black and white, so I’ve only ever seen the shot that way. Instead of shooting in colour and effectively removing it all? I’m not certain.</p>
<p>This isn’t so to say I’m converted, but a simple change to my camera has enabled me to see things differently. There aren’t many things that are like this any more, so it’s a strange feeling. Plus, I also have my wife’s “I told you so” in my ear!</p>

      <p>It appears that this <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html">journaling thing</a> is sticking. At least for now. I am 8 days into it (I started a bit before deciding to purchase pro) with a streak going and everything. Out of those first few days I almost forgot once and didn’t complete my morning pages until 2pm. Which I don’t think is bad going for something I am still unsure what to do with.</p>
<p>Whenever I write about this people come back with all sorts of suggestions, that I have tried numerous time. I could be really stupid but I still don’t know what to write half the time. I am just getting into the habit of opening the app to my morning pages journal and typing something out. It usually starts with some navel-gazing, but some thoughts and feeling usually come to the surface fairly quickly.</p>
<p>There is no way to know if this helps at all, but as an overall indicator of the new year, I do feel better in myself and have more motivation to do things. However, that could be that I actually managed to sleep over the holidays and my body is at a baseline of tiredness instead of <a href="/2021/12/01/team-no-sleep.html">in desperation mode</a> (it was 2:20am this morning).</p>
<p>Weirdly, I actually enjoy the process of spending a few minutes to typing things out in my own bubble. I try to do 5 minutes, and it sometimes goes a little over. I can get quite a bit off my chest in that time. I am going to start saving more things to Day One when we spend time as a family and keep some pictures in there, but as for journaling, I am still unsure. As a first test I <em>will</em> do 30 days and see what I end up feeling like.</p>

      <p>I often forget to put these two tiny words into my sentences. When I make <a href="/categories/links/">link posts</a> or try to make a point, it’s easy to get carried away and state your opinion as fact. When all we are really doing it publishing what we think.</p>
<p>There’s typically not many definitive answers to the things I tend to write about. It’s all ephemeral thoughts, feelings, educated guesses. There might be some research conducted here and there about the topics, but frequently the conclusions to those have more questions than answers.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with giving our opinions on things, it’s the whole point, really. Blogging about topics and ideas that we have that might be right. Yet, I forget to put in those tiny words a lot of the time. I think a lot about the topics I write about, I just don’t write about thinking. I write about knowing.</p>

      <p>Matt Birchler <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://birchtree.me/blog/im-once-again-defneding-like-buttons/">defending the like button</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think of likes on social media kind of like non-verbal responses in the real world.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with the statements Matt makes (or made a while ago) because they are accurate to social media convention. Most people won’t reply, nor will the author get as much affirmation back to their post. But to that, I push back and say it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>We’ve convinced ourselves to do things for likes and clicks. Posting for the sweet dopamine that comes from peoples responses when we shouldn’t care. As if posting to the internet is some kind of performative act.</p>
<p>I say shouldn’t because I get it, <a href="/2021/11/12/do-i-like.html">we all like likes</a>, but we shouldn’t do. A like online is the social media version of “lol” to a text message. It means I’ve seen this, and I want to avoid appearing rude, so heres a button click.</p>
<p>In many ways, it’s worse. Even if, as Matt points out, the replies are mostly “cool” and other derivatives, at least the person took some time to do it. They didn’t fall down, responding with anything besides a button click. But pressing like makes you and the person on the other end feel good, so there&rsquo;s no immediate downside, really.</p>
<p>It’s the long-term effects that <a href="https://www.thinkuknow.co.uk/professionals/our-views/likes-loves-and-shares-how-we-can-reduce-their-impact-on-wellbeing/?fbclid=IwAR3xWZz_Dl25HzpHr3Cu2ONiv1pS0E7f_C3RqE9j0wGB0jjqOAlc51YHmgg">cause the issues</a>. Even though it may not apply to you, a huge proportion of people get self-worth from likes. They have become a yard stick that people measure themselves against, and have removed a lot of interaction. Not all interaction is verbal, I get it, but I also don’t have a counter next to the number of people that’s smiled at me today.</p>

      <p>Mike Chudley in his video on <a href="https://youtu.be/8jAev1AecMk">Why 85mm is RUINING your Street Photography</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that 85 millimeter lens could be ruining your street photography and more precisely hindering your ability to improve as a street photographer</p></blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>someone walking down the street at f/1.4 isn&rsquo;t street photography it&rsquo;s lazy</p></blockquote>
<p>First things first, I really like Mike’s videos (usually) and have followed him on instagram for a long time. He is a great photographer and one of my inspirations. I’ve DM’d him a couple of times to say I love his photography, and he seems like a nice, genuine guy. I think this video is purposely explosive to get views and spark discussion. Which is a good thing, but I’d like to push back.</p>
<p>The way the video comes across, and some statements made infuriate me because it is needlessly preachy. Not because <a href="/2022/04/16/mm-for-street.html">I’m a fan of 85mm</a>, but because it’s dismissive. I simply can&rsquo;t get as close as 35 mm in the places I go, I can’t walk around London for hours on end, so I have to take what I can find. Smaller towns and villages are my stomping ground and I <em>have</em> to be a bit further away, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>I agree with what he is hinting at. Low aperture shots look nice, but often don’t show off the whole point of street photography. All the situational information and the environment is blurred out, removing the entire point. But smaller focal lengths just don’t suit my style, so to say I am lazy, and my photography isn’t good enough because I don’t like standing on top of people is just bizarre.</p>
<p>I switched off when he claimed that “walking down the street at F 1.4 isn&rsquo;t street photography, it&rsquo;s lazy”. There is some useful advice in there somewhere, but the hyperbole ruined it for me.</p>

<p>fundamentally people are, when it comes to the internet, lazy. And gathering where everyone else is definitely seems easier. It&rsquo;s also easier to delegate the job of moderating and policing to someone else, and so as a result people will inevitably cluster around a few big websites, regardless of what infrastructure we build.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this post is spot on. These people hanging around on mastodon, and other ActivityPub supporting platforms, are a tiny minority. Most people don’t want to think about servers, moderation, or anything. They will just go where everyone else is.</p>
<p>Why do you think people hold on to horrible places like Instagram for far too long? They <em>are</em> lazy, unmotivated and insulated by a herd. It’s a nice idea, and a wonderful place to be, but it’s never going to be mainstream&hellip;..but that’s totally OK.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Another little app that I discovered to <a href="/2023/01/04/two-new-mac.html">aid my Mac life</a> recently is <em>another</em> free one. I discovered this one through a post by fellow micro.blogger <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://heydingus.net/blog/2022/12/folder-peek-app">Jarrod Blundy</a>, and it has become a staple of my Mac usage ever since.</p>
<p>Do you ever have to go digging around in finder to head to the same usual folders time after time? Me to. We have a Dropbox shared archive at work that drives me insane with the amount of level changes I need. Sure, I could set up a load of messy aliases or dock folders, but this apps solves all of that. Placing a nice and neat icon in my menu bar and storing all the folders I require.</p>
<img src="uploads/2024/531d519647.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
<p>I can also navigate around with ease to other destinations, see a preview of the file, or open the file I require without leaving my desktop. There are so many delightful little touches that it's hard to point out them all. My favourites are right-clicking on the icon opens the folder in finder, and that I can set a few different folders to all be accessible from one menu bar icon. Although it is starting to look a bit full now!</p>
<p>I am so impressed with this app I’m also testing a few other ones by the same developer <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/apps">Sindre Sorhus</a> as they all seem very high quality. I have already installed, <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/today">Today</a> to put my calendar in my menu bar (menu bar all the things) and also <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/actions">Actions</a> to extend Shortcuts abilities. I have a feeling that I might be going all out on customising my Mac currently so I hope you don’t mind me sharing what I find along the way.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>This afternoon, I randomly decided I was going to go into town and buy a bullet journal. No idea why, just seeing all the new year posts around and <a href="https://patrickrhone.micro.blog/2022/12/31/preparation.html">numerous people setting theirs up</a> made me want one. The only issue is that I already know this wouldn’t work for me, I’ve tried it, and only a few days ago writing <a href="/2022/12/31/i-really-want.html">two posts outlining why this wouldn’t work for me</a>. That wasn’t going to stop me though.</p>
<p>Watching YouTube and looking online for the journal I was going to buy, and it only took about an hour for me to realise the error in my thinking. I would happily pay £20-30 to get a book and some pens etc, but not £20 for a year if Day One (there’s a new years offer until today). I already know that digital tools are better for me to use. The only attractiveness of using something manual is that I will have even <a href="/2021/10/07/i-dont-use.html">less reason to use my phone</a>. Which is still quite attractive, I must admit.</p>
<p>What I did instead was stump up for a year of premium in Day One, so I can have a few different journals. One for morning pages. One for random thoughts and feelings whenever I feel like writing, and perhaps another for logging what we get up to as a family with photos. I really like the idea of getting one printed each year with our adventures in.</p>
<p>So, I went full circle in a matter of an hour or so, just like I always do, but I do feel like this will really help me, I feel positive about this decision.</p>

      <p>I’m on a bit of <a href="/2022/12/20/overthinking-social-media.html">journey</a> at the moment. One that I am determined not the be preachy about but one that I will share some thoughts and feeling about along the way. Since quitting Twitter, I’ve been <a href="/2022/12/15/calming-down-my.html">assessing where and how I want to spend my time</a> and due to random Googling about social media topics I came across a video by Sam Massey.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEi058UQWLc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>He talks about quitting social media and references a video by <a href="https://youtu.be/EF995dMIWP4">Dave VanDonge</a> as his main inspiration. The talking point is this - the average American spends 705 hours a year on social media. In 8 hour work days that is <strong>four months of work!</strong></p>
<p>Just think about that. 705 hours of doing nothing but scrolling through social media and often being exposed to the worst that humanity has to offer. There’s exceptions here of course. To all those screaming “yeah but&hellip;” I am sure your feed is curated perfectly and the time you spend there is be beneficial to you. Awesome. But just think about all that time.</p>
<p>The average (so there’s some people out there doing much more to make up for me) American puts in four months work to social media. Think about all those people that don’t have time to see friends. Or exercise like they want to. Or learn a new skill. Whatever it is, the time is there, it’s just not being used.</p>
<p>Like I said, no preaching. I’m not telling you to go delete all your social media accounts right now. But man. That’s a load of hours to just waste away. Actual figures could be even worse, some places found around <a href="https://www.oberlo.co.uk/statistics/how-much-time-does-the-average-person-spend-on-social-media">147 minutes a day</a> (just under 900hours a year). I’m still in a bit of a shock.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For once, the YouTube algorithm came up trumps and I stumbled, across a new channel to subscribe to. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JeffSu">Jeff Su</a> makes productivity videos (doesn’t everyone on there) and I’ve found some of his content really helpful. First whilst researching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M6bIeVbCqA&amp;t=20s">improvements for my productivity</a>, and I then watched a video on simple Mac that he thinks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkYNdy-Hig4">are underrated</a>.</p>
<p>Two stuck out straight away for me and I have been using them ever since. They are Shottr and Latest, both of which combined to produce <a href="/2023/01/03/i-always-enjoy.html">this post</a> yesterday when the new micro.blog Mac app update came out.</p>
<h2 id="shottr">Shottr</h2>
<p>I really love <a href="https://cleanshot.com/">Cleanshot x</a>, it offers more options but it’s also £30. Whereas <a href="https://shottr.cc/">Shottr</a> is completely free and gets you 80% of the way there. With powerful keyboard shortcuts, the option to include backgrounds and also mark up your screenshots, it’s outstanding that you get all this for free.</p>
<p>It also has built in OCR and you can blur out text without blurring the rest of the image, which helps when you share as many screenshots as I do.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d38192e7c4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="latest">Latest</h2>
<p>For all the apps you have installed from outside the App Store, Latest offers a nice update interface. Instead of setting each app to check for updates and call home every so often, you can turn these all off and just check <a href="https://max.codes/latest/">Latest</a> once a week or so.</p>
<p>The reason that app is so appealing is the awkward updates that seem to pop up when you are trying to do something, and this simple app puts you back in control. It will present all updates in an essay to understand interface and even pull in all the information such as descriptions and changelogs.</p>
<p>I hope that these two <strong>free</strong> apps can be as helpful to you as they are to me. I am always on the lookout for new things to make my Mac better considering how much time I spend sat at it so I will keep posting new things I find.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>A couple of days ago I wrote a <a href="/2023/01/02/can-we-try.html">link post</a>, the same as I have done hundreds of times before. Found an article online somewhere, read it, picked out a few things that stuck out and threw them into Apple Notes. I typed out my thoughts on the couple of highlighted areas and published these to my blog.</p>
<p>No more thought was put into this than I have put into every other link post I have ever published. Unless I am specifically subscribed to the author, I have absolutely no knowledge any further than the post I consume, or perhaps some supporting links they post in said article. However, this linked post I published happened to be by someone who has some <a href="https://www.glaad.org/gap/jesse-singal">terrible ideas about trans individuals</a>, and this was only pointed out to me yesterday evening.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this was by the excellent podcaster Alex Cox (you can see the replies on the <a href="/2023/01/02/can-we-try.html">post</a>) making me more aware of the person I was linking to. To be clear, these ideas are not in the post I liked to, I just read a post talking about ancient aliens and thought the ideas surrounding disagreement were poignant in the current climate. However, this doesn’t stop me feeling terrible about it.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/009e3813ba.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As soon as I received the reply, I began to worry and think about what I should do. My heart was absolutely in the right place, and I immediately wanted to make sure I have done the right thing. I think it is OK to separate some ideas from the person who has them, but at some point publishing online I do have a certain responsibility, even with the tiny platform that I have. It would break my heart that someone would find this person through my post and then consume other terrible posts and ideas.</p>
<p>Let’s just say I didn’t sleep much last night thinking about this, but I decided in the end to keep the post up, but with a clear disclaimer at the top. I believe the post still stands up on its own. I hope people understand that I read this at face value, however I genuinely understand how it could read if you are aware of the backstory (which I was clueless about).</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It’s been a <a href="/2021/11/30/my-focus-mode.html">little over a year</a> since I wrote about setting up iOS focus modes. At the time, it was a new feature in iOS15 and one that felt far from ready for release. The confusing UX and complicated options lead to my conclusion that hardly any people would use the feature. Now 13 months on, my feelings have changed very little. Improvements <em>have</em> been made, but the hoops you have to jump through, and the missing features, mean that Focus Modes on all Apple devices still suck.</p>
<p>Overall, the experience of trying to set up your Focus Modes feels like it was designed by an engineer. That the team designing this already expects you to understand how to use it, with little to no onboarding or instructions. This isn’t unique to Focus Modes, Apple still struggles to communicate the intricacies of its software and even <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608">the help guides online</a> expect you to already have a large knowledge of the feature you need help with.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2ba730ec9e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I did get a little too excited when iOS16 introduced a way for apps to tap into the new focus modes. Namely, Apple Mail can now make certain accounts show at certain times, but with there still being no “everything else” Focus Mode, you can’t make your work email <em>only</em> show in a work Focus Mode. It will still be displayed when there is no Focus mode active.</p>
<p>This wouldn’t be an issue, I could just create a focus mode that is active when not at work and hack around this. Except that an icon appears at the op of my screen constantly, and the sync between devices is still all or nothing. Apple really needs to spend some time thinking about how these modes work and how normal people might use them. I love the fact I can have my phone be different things at different times, but the designers haven’t thought about what happens the rest of the time.</p>
<p>Having Focus Modes is better than nothing. The improvements are moving in the right direction, but setting them up and understanding everything falls well short of the mark I expect.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Sounds simple, doesn’t it. Everyone who’s used the web knows what a blog is. They <em>were</em> the web for a very long time, before all this social media nonsense kicked off, and there’s a very <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging">real push</a> for more people to start them. The belief is that you have to have something to write about, or you need a special set of skills, but in reality you don’t need anything.</p>
<p>Well, you require a way to do it, and thankfully there are loads of options out there, many of them free, but this post isn’t about that. The trouble comes with what to put on your blog, and that’s where it’s important to remember what a blog is. It’s a web log. It’s there for you to ‘log’ anything you want. From thoughts and ideas, to life lessons and photos from vacations. There should be no worry about the what or the why of what you put on your blog.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f8ee75f4f5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>You don’t need to start a website. Nor do you need to <a href="https://www.nitinkhanna.com/dont-moleskine-your-blog/">moleskin the posts</a> you put there. You just need to take all the output you would usually give to a social network for free and put it on your blog. That’s why services like micro.blog, Tumblr or WordPress plugins like social sharing are the best place to start. You can share your blog to wherever you want, but keep control of everything you do.</p>
<p>There’s a higher, more preachy post on owning your content in here somewhere, too. One that urges you to get to grips with blogging to make the web a better place, but all you need to worry about is having a blog. Using it for whatever you want to use it for, and making sure you carry on sharing with the web. What is a blog is a question with numerous unique answers, but the reality is that a blog is <strong>you</strong>.</p>

It would appear that the author of the linked post has some very wrong ideas of his own. I think my post still stands up as I took the linked article at face value. However given the informtion that I now know the post could be seen in a completely different light.
<p>I did not know this at the time of writing and will not be linking to this person again. For more infromation see <a href="https://www.glaad.org/gap/jesse-singal">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Jesse Singal urging us to <a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/in-2023-lets-rediscover-wrongness">Rediscover Wrongness</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People can usually believe wrong things without being dangerous, and in fact billions of people do hold religious beliefs that make no logical sense without becoming violent zealots.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am wrong, what feels like hundreds of times a day, some days. Occasionally, it’s small things that I didn’t think though correctly and guessed. Sporadically, it is matters I didn’t really understand or misinterpreted the information I had at hand. And every so often I just choose wrong, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with this.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong I am right a lot of the time too, I’m not ready for life help yet, but I am not doing anyone any harm. There’s no malice in a lot of the things I believe in that could be wrong, I am just wrong and that should be OK. I’m fine with being wrong, finding out that I am wrong and then changing my world view, but many people seem to have forgotten this skill altogether.</p>
<p>The issue comes when someone that another <em>thinks</em> is incorrect is painted as a harmful, and often portrayed in an exaggerated way. The other side of a disagreement isn’t evil or trying to trick you, they just see the world differently to you and make decisions based on their experiences. As Jesse points out in the linked article, “If everything is dangerous or violent, then nothing is”.</p>
<p>The notion in the article of much of this constant state of angriness is due to the attention economy is correct. The more exaggerated the accusations and finger pointing, the more attention is gained. No-one believes that having a wrong idea about the way the Pyramids are built is harmful, as the author well knows, but that doesn’t get clicks, does it.</p>
<p>There is also a real issue of the bubbles we all live in now. Social media algorithms creates a space where we see posts and updates that we agree with. YouTube and Netflix force content on us that we will like, and issues arise when we bump up against the edges. We, the people, need to learn how to disagree with someone but still appreciate them as a person. To smile and shake your head at the conspiracy theorist next door, but still stop and talk to them whenever you can.</p>
<p>The lines of politics have never been this rigid before, and it’s pathetic. I know we can get back to being OK with this. I was brought up with a friend group that was as diverse as it comes, and with an ingrained bullshit detector that was sharpened in a school without internet access. We learnt to fall out, make up again, argue and bicker but still get along together.</p>
<p>I know this ability is in all of us. One wish for 2023, now the walls of large social media are at least a bit broken, can we re-learn to disagree politely, please? To take criticism, embrace other view points and not worry about it. You might actually learn something too.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2023/01/02/i-was-going.html"><h1 class="p-name">I Was Going To Write Today</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I really was. Despite not feeling very well, and not due to New Year&rsquo;s Eve for once, I wanted to publish something today. Not because I had much to say, but because I am on a bit of a roll lately and have found that the act of wanting to write something usually pushes something into my mind.</p>
<p>This is in stark contrast to my thoughts a few months ago, where I chose to keep quiet unless I had <a href="/2021/11/19/something-to-say.html">something to say</a>. However, I have found that my motivation needs a bit of a prod even now and again. Taking some advice from James Clear in <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780735211292">Atomic Habits</a> (<a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://chrishannah.me/success-is-a-lagging-indicator/">via Chris Hannah</a>) sometimes I have to want to be a writer and take on a writer&rsquo;s identity to actually do some writing.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bbfc93e351.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead, I just fixed loads of bugs in my blog, wrote an <a href="/about/me/">about me page</a> and played around with my writing environment. I’ve been a long-time user of Ulysses and have been feeling the itch to move to something new. Doing the usual thing of <a href="/2021/03/19/looking-for-my.html">downloading every app going</a>, realising that Ulysses is the best one for me again, and instead messing with my theme to make it look new. A new lick of paint seems to have done the trick for now at least.</p>
<p>Hence, this post started out as a test to see whether I liked the new theme or not. So in a round about way I did what I set to do, just not in the way a ‘proper writer’ should do. Or maybe they do, fart about and do other things until inspiration hits them? I have no idea, but getting things done in your own way doesn’t really matter as long as the thing gets done — and I had fun doing it.</p>

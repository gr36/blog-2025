  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>After the last few years using exclusively Fuji cameras, bar a short test with a Ricoh GRiiix, I am sorry to say I’ve switched back to Sony. There are a few reasons for this, but this is in no way a justification or a reason why I think they suck, merely my thoughts on the subject as a few people have asked. This won’t be a very elegant post, just a few points I feel are worth raising.</p>
<p><img src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/uploads/2025/dscf1412.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="auto-focus">Auto Focus</h2>
<p>“Why don’t you just manual focus like a <strong>real</strong> photographer?” I hear them shout back to my pathetic moaning. The truth is, when I got my first Fuji camera after selling all my Sony gear about 4 years ago, I thought the autofocus sucked. It didn’t. Granted, it wasn’t as good as I was used to with my Sony A7iii, but after a bit of experimentation I got used to its quirks and found it pretty reliable for the types of photography I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Since getting the XT5 I felt a decline in performance from the autofocus, particularly AFC, which affected my enjoyment. In street photography there can be fleeting moments and I missed quite a few of them because of poor or slow autofocus. Recent firmware updates have promised to fix this but have indeed made it worse! This came to a head around a month ago when camped out waiting for a shot I had lined up. After more than 45 minutes of waiting for subjects, the autofocus kept letting me down.</p>
<p>It was as they call it, the straw that broke the camel’s back.</p>
<p><img src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/uploads/2025/dscf1040.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="build-quality">Build Quality</h2>
<p>There has also been a significant decline in build quality. My trusty XT3 felt like a masterpiece and was a delight to use. As was my X100V. Solid, reliable and nice to use. Whereas the XT5 had creaky doors covering the ports and seemed to be made for the scratchiest plastic they could find.</p>
<p>It never let me down in the short time I had it, but it didn’t fill me full of confidence, and I know others have had problems with cracking, whether sealing and other minor issues. Fujifilm seems <a href="https://fujixweekly.com/2024/07/08/is-fujifilm-purposefully-causing-shortages-to-manipulate-the-market/">more concerned with purposely restricting manufacturing</a> than actually making good cameras.</p>
<p><img src="https://gregmorris.co.uk/uploads/2025/9aea494b-e857-4a40-baac-a68820a5a3eb.jpg" alt="Auto-generated description: A person walks through a dimly lit tunnel with illuminated artwork on the walls."></p>
<h2 id="i-miss-the-joy">I Miss The Joy</h2>
<p>There are things I will miss from Fuji Cameras, particularly how enjoyable they are to use with top dials for settings, but they lost the joy I had when first using them due to the above issues. I don’t make any money from my photography, and these frustrations got in my way of having a good time when out and about.</p>
<p>Sony cameras often feel too sterile and boring. Perfect for a pro workhorse but missing something special. However, the A7CR that I picked up, with a 50 mm prime, feels at least a little like a Leica and has brought me back at least some enjoyment.</p>

      <p>Kōdō Shimon writing about the rise in <a href="https://simone.org/synthography/">AI &lsquo;Street Photography&rsquo;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Street photography isn&rsquo;t just about getting images. It&rsquo;s about being present in the world, engaging with fellow humans, finding the courage to put yourself in uncomfortable situations.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should preface my thoughts on this with the fact that I am not against LLMs’ use as an assistive tool. I do so daily and am a big fan of what they can do for my life and my productivity (yes, I just threw up a bit typing that word out).</p>
<p>What I really hate is the use of AI to create an end product that means absolutely nothing. I have been quite into this, creating supporting images for my blog posts with AI because I thought it was needed, but I quickly realised that it completely misses the point.</p>
<p>The whole point of looking at a photo is because it captures a point in time that happened. I won’t get into the whole “what is a photo?” debate here because photographers can manipulate it, play with colours, and enhance the effects present in the image. But it still happened. At some point, a sensor captured the photo and processed the image of a real-world event.</p>
<p>This is what evokes the emotions. The ability to see the image and reflect on it happening. Otherwise, what is the point? For street photography in particular, this is one of my passions, and creating it artificially defeats the whole purpose of the genre. When <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/">I take photos</a>, I want to show the beauty and the art in everyday life. From the small details you miss when you don’t look deeper.</p>
<p>Other street photographers capture moments that may never be repeated. Events and people that are frozen in time as a reference point of things that happened. As pointed out in the post, the use of AI to recreate these types of photos represents</p>
<p>“the collapse of meaning in our rush to simulate experience rather than live it”. The end product is the only concern, producing an image instead of creating a photo. “emulation versus native execution” as Kōdō puts it.</p>
<p>When I take photos, I am engrossed in the world like no other experience can reproduce. It is very much like meditation, enabling me to think about nothing else than spotting beautiful details of everyday life that you may consider mundane. It is an experience, and I like to think that transfers through the resultant image.</p>
<p>Remove all of this out of the process, and it completely misses the point. You get nothing more than a throwaway arrangement of pixels that means absolutely nothing — but then again, forgettable media seems to be what the world revolves around now.</p>

      <p>Manuel Moreale writing <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/@/page/stVqZccByYVbTemk">Kindness in a transactional world</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kindness is the reason why I’m doing this. There’s no other reason. I don’t care about getting a reward. I care about showing people that in this stupid transactional world, we can still be kind to one another. We can still help someone, even if we’ll get nothing in return.</p></blockquote>
<p>Manuel’s posts are some of my favourite to read online. Through provoking, and revolving around pushing to the web. So I may find references to his work all over my blog because of how similar they feel to my thoughts. Particularly when it comes to writing and publishing for free.</p>
<p>Getting paid for doing something you enjoy is every person’s dream, yet when I think about getting paid for writing online, I would dread it. I enjoy it much more when my motivation is just for the fun of it. To be kind and put out my thoughts, ideas, and solutions to problems into the world and hope they help someone in a similar position.</p>
<p>As I have written before, I see my place in this world as <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2023/02/03/im-here-for.html">being for others</a>. I <em>always</em> <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/03/08/my-enjoyment-is.html">put myself last</a>, and I am perfectly fine with doing so because the things I do are because I like being kind. I want my actions to show that in a world that seems to value return on investment and monitoring even part of your life, you don’t need to live like that.</p>

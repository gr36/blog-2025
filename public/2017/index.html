<p>You will often find me spending far too much money on productivity apps, but I have another love. Cases are another thing I am never happy with, always looking for the new thing that will keep my pride and joy safe.</p>
<p>Finding the balance point between protecting your phone, but also not adding too much weight or bulk is a difficult choice. Whilst the <a href="/post/2017-11-08-iphonex-impressions/">iPhone X is great</a> and gives me a nice big screen to use one handed, it is heavier than previous models, so adding the official case has bumped the weight up to almost the tipping point.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-12-28-Lopie-seaisland-inside-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/281238dd84.jpg" alt="2017 12 28 Lopie seaisland inside 1" width="600" height="300" border="0" /></p>
<p>When my phone took a <a href="/post/2017-08-20-careful-with-my-phone/">tumble earlier this year</a> it survived only because of the official leather case. Others would have provided it with similar protection, but it has made me so fearful of a similar accident with my £1000 purchase. I just <a href="/post/2017-11-04-few-hours-naked/">can’t use it naked for very long</a>. So ever in search of something new I ordered the Lopie Sea Island Corton Series case and here is my quick review.</p>
<p>The only reason I ordered this model is because the Verge adorning it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16744278/apple-iphone-x-leather-case">the best leather case</a>, and for £15 I figured why not try it. I wasn’t quite banking on an estimated delivery of 20–25 days though! Thankfully it arrived after 20, well packaged and made of great quality materials. The Lopie Sea Island Corton Series case is covered by a combination of a tweed like material at the top and a leather at the bottom. My particular version is light brown.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-12-28-Lopie-seaisland-camera-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/42f5e7f477.jpg" alt="2017 12 28 Lopie seaisland camera 1" width="600" height="300" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>Case Pouch</strong></h2>
<p>I’m not a fan of keeping bank cards, or any other type of card for that matter tucked in the back of my phone. Some people use their case as a faux wallet and store everything in there. However great this seems in practice, it can be extremely annoying when you want to actually use the phone.</p>
<p>This for me is the only sticking point of a great case – there is a card slot in the back of the phone. Where material meets leather, for some reason Lopie made it a pocket. However I have never tucked a card in there, and never will. The small gap is barely noticeable and I struggle to get a finger nail in there to prise it open. Should you wish to use it to store a card or two, I have no doubt the leather will stretch to accommodate this. However once this is done, there is no going back, it will be a pocket forever.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-12-28-Lopie-seaisland-buttons-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a0e50da76d.jpg" alt="2017 12 28 Lopie seaisland buttons 1" width="600" height="300" border="0" /></p>
<h1><strong>Feel</strong></h1>
<p>The pouch does mean that there is a difference in height of the two materials. When handling the phone, you will notice a ‘lip’ that takes a little getting used to when compared to standard staple cases. For the last couple of years I have settled into moving backwards and forwards between an Apple Leather case, and also an Apple silicone case. So having any difference in texture felt strange to start but an easy enough compromise.</p>
<p>The leather strangely ads a certain slippery feel when compared to the grip of the material at the top. However I have every confidence the leather will age well, and some doubts that the top of the case will do the same. The case will provide a good level of drop protection but the material will definitely suffer should it happen outside.</p>
<p>The designers have offset the grey fabric against extremely tactile if a little garish buttons. They compliment the colouring of the leather reasonably well, however highlighted handset buttons seem to be the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/lets-talk-about-that-pixel-2-contrast-color-button-though/">in look at the moment</a>. With that said they are sturdy and offer reassuring clicks when pressed, something missing from most cases around this price point.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>This is a great case for the price point. It offers luxury akin to the official Apple cases but at a fraction of the price. It will take a while to get to you, but it is definitely worth the wait. The attention to detail on the buttons and also the second sim and ejection tool pocket found inside the case, all lead me to believe in the workmanship gone into the Lopie Sea Island Corton Series case.</p>
<p>More than anything, this case has made me realise how much I would love a case made of the fabric material. Google did a great job with the Pixel case, and I’m hoping someone will make one in the very near future. However this case is one of the best I have tried. Stylish and comfortable to hold without much bulk.</p>

<p>I can feel it once again, the stirs of urges that are controlling my habits without any conscious thought. All the billions poured into research and development, all the hours of design and engineering are working. All simply to keep me picking up the computer in my pocket.</p>
<p>Although many claim these issues do not exist, I can tell you for a fact they do and I can feel it once more. The word addiction stirs up some powerful emotions. The thought of smartphone addiction brings with it the notion of someone weak that is simply not strong enough to put down the handset. It labels those as a sub class, with overtones of snark. Yet we are ALL those addicts.</p>
<p>Any moment of boredom and the hand reaches into the pocket and out comes the warm glow of pixels and hits of dopamine. For the last few months I have been aware of these effects, consciously fighting these feelings of behavioural addiction. It is only once you stop doing what is almost normal you can observe the behaviour of others around you. Much as a ex-drug addict can observe minute clues in those still fighting addiction, I can not only see the changes in others, but in myself.</p>
<blockquote><p>Recent studies suggest the most compulsive behaviour we engage in has to do with cyber connectivity; 40% of us have some sort of internet-based addiction — whether it’s checking your email (on average workers check it 36 times an hour), mindlessly scrolling through other people’s breakfasts on Instagram or gambling online. — Fatima Bhutto, The guardian.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since purchasing the iPhone X, I have been using my phone much more then I want to. I can feel the itch that others must feel. In order to justify my expensive purchase, and as well as enjoying a new purchase, I have been using it much more than previous phones. With thanks to unethical app design and a gloriously immersive screen, the behavioural addiction has returned.</p>
<p>I find myself reaching for my phone when I have no need to. The itch returns at ridiculous times and requires conscious thought to stop. My mind is simply reliant on having something to entertain me, even when there are many other options. I am not some weak minded person to be dismissed, although I feel that way. The only reason I feel these things is because I have broken the cycle once before. I must do again, and so should you.</p>

<p>I’ve been toying with the idea of journaling for a long time. I’ve started jotting things down several times, but never really got the hang of it. Although I liked the idea of having a <a href="https://medium.com/p/23f1d1c23df5?source=linkShare-fa062289c217-1512807706">physical diary of my thoughts</a>, I was always worried it wouldn’t stay personal. So a digital version seemed like the only way and thats where Day One comes it. Helping me to journal as much as I like keeping it safe and secure.</p>
<p>The version in current use is actually the second iteration by developer <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/day-one-journal/id1044867788?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Bloom Built</a>. Even this iteration has existed since 2016, so this is not a new app or service. Many users have been on a <a href="https://twitter.com/ljrain/status/931876494325972992">steak for years</a>, and the app is constantly being improved and updated. I’ve been using it on and off for 3 years to store some thoughts, as well as setting up IFTTT recipes to capture <a href="https://ifttt.com/applets/395684p">my Instagram</a>and blog posts. However over the past few weeks I’ve been using it daily to capture my thoughts and feelings to much benefit to my mental health.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-12-09-day-One-mockups-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/923899ceee.jpg" alt="2017 12 09 day One mockups 1" width="600" height="399" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>Using the app</strong></h2>
<p>The design of the app is extremely easy to understand and dare I say it very pleasing to use. If you wish to make an entry simply tap on the cross in the main area or at the bottom of your entry list. The icons at the bottom of the screen are a little confusing, from left to right you have the option to quickly change journal (you need a plus or greater to do this), filter image moats, make an entry, show the locations of your posts or bring up a large calendar.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of these they become natural but certainly could be be more clear. For example you can also change journal in the top left of the main screen, so why you need two options is unclear. However a small UI confusion can be forgive because the rest of the interface is very clear and easy to use. Tap either cross to make a post and begin your journaling journey.</p>
<p>In the entry screen you can add in text formatted as you desire with headings and other styling. You can also add in photos already taken or capture you own straight from the app. Many other apps I have tried prioritise text entires above anything else, but with Day One I have clipped in images that have caught my eye, and many that have displayed my current feelings in an image. If I simply want to enter a location for me to expand on later, I can open the Apple Watch app to drop a pin or dictate a quick entry.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-12-12-dayone-watch-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/33190ec48c.jpg" alt="2017 12 12 dayone watch 1" width="1400" height="369" border="0" />If you wish to post your entries to other platforms such as a blog there are several export options through the share sheet.</p>
<p>Those wishing to capture every inch of their lives can also automatically add locations, current weather, tags and even your activity data to journal entries. Don’t worry if this is too much information for you to give up because not only is syncing encrypted between devices (Premium required), you can also secure the app with passcode or TouchID/FaceID.</p>
<h2><strong>Price</strong></h2>
<p>Day One has adopted the subscription payment model that causes so much divide in opinion. I purchased the app before this move so I get a slightly different level but for new customers you have a choice of level.</p>
<p>The App is completely free to download and use. You can journal away and never pay a penny. With the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>One journal</li>
<li>One photo per entry</li>
<li>Unlimited entries</li>
<li>Local backups (including iCloud device backups)</li>
<li>Exporting (PDF, JSON, Plain Text)</li>
<li>Book Printing</li>
<li>Activity Feed (iOS)</li>
<li>Maintenance and non-Premium updates as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can then upgrade should they wish to add in extra features. This costs $34.99 USD/year or $3.99 USD/month. For this price on top of the free features you shall receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited journals</li>
<li>30 photos per entry</li>
<li>Mac app with Premium features</li>
<li>Unlimited syncing with Day One Sync</li>
<li>End-to-end encryption with Day One Sync</li>
<li>Discount on book printing (currently available in US only)</li>
<li>IFTTT integration</li>
<li>Access to Day One Web (beta) and Android (when released)</li>
<li>Future access to Premium features like audio recording, writing prompts, video entries, additional photos per entry, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although a subscription service <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/29/day-one-app-now-a-subscription-service/">always proves to be controversial</a>, most users simply do not need to pay anything. Day One offers fantastic value for money for those wanting to get started. Users can to dive straight in and start filling in a journal with unlimited entries including one photo for free. Only if you require multiple journals, syncing, or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/day-one/id1055511498?mt=12&amp;at=1000ltj4">access to the Mac app</a> will you need to spend any money. Providing that you use iCloud backups when you get a new device, you won’t even need to worry about syncing to the cloud.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-12-12-Dayonemacapp-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/85c5343f34.jpg" alt="2017 12 12 Dayonemacapp 1" width="800" height="500" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>URL Support</strong></h2>
<p>Day One has great support for third party API use and also URL schemes for new entries and opening into specific areas.</p>
<p>Create Entry with Text <code>dayone://post?entry=</code> Create Entry with Tags: <code>dayone://post?entry=Hello Self&amp;tags=My Tag, Test</code> Create Entry in Journal: <code>dayone://post?entry=Hello Self&amp;journal=Day One</code> Create Entry with Clipboard Image: <code>dayone://post?entry=Hello Self&amp;imageClipboard=1</code></p>
<p>This will allow you to use use shortcuts in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/launcher-with-multiple-widgets/id905099592?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Launcher</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Launch Centre Pro</a>. <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/2016/03/day-one-ifttt/">IFTTT support</a> requires the paid upgrade, however the API only works as a write API, there is no read API. So support is limited to ‘THAT’ rather than universal usage. I have asked Day One for <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/939461078471335936">expanded support</a>, and it isn’t on their roadmap as yet.</p>
<p>There are also a wide range of tools available for Day One, ranging from <a href="https://github.com/underscorephil/todoist_dayone">Todoist scripts</a> to importing entries from other apps. So you really can dig in and make Day One the centre of <a href="https://intercom.help/dayone/day-one-2-0/day-one-tools">your daily routine</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>In contrast to every other <a href="/tags/app/">app I have reviewed in the past</a>, the conclusion for this app split into two areas. The benefits of Journaling regularly have paid off on my mental health, and allowed me to write down the way I am feeling without the worry of those feelings being exposed to anyone else but me. There is also the conclusion of using the app itself.</p>
<p>Day one provides the opportunity for you to use the app completely free of charge and reap the benefits. I have used other Journaling options and dismissed them straight away due to ease of use. There are no such issue with Day One, the app is really easy to use, and is very well designed for the most part. If you want to start journaling, look no further than the Day One.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>On a recent <a href="https://www.byodpodcast.com/episodes/episode-28-it-looks-like-this-turkey-is-taking-a-selfie/17/11/2017">episode of Bring Your Own Device,</a> I was adamant that the recent control centre indicator was a weird bug and would soon go away. Yet here we are with iOS 11.2 now public, and it’s still there! The reason I was so sure is that Apple has never relied on indicating things more than once – the reason I was wrong is that Apple doesn’t seem to know what they are doing any more.</p>
<p>There appears to be a massive issue with consistency in Apple Software. Pick up any of this year&rsquo;s new devices running iOS 11 and swipe up from the bottom of the screen. The three current devices all do entirely different things for this one gesture. A swipe up on the iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 (all currently sold be Apple) accesses the Control Centre and has done since implementation in iOS7 back in 2013.
Perform the same gesture on the iPad and you will be treated with a floating doc of apps, or the multitasking screen, depending on the length of your swipe. Pick up the new iPhone X, however, and you will go to the home screen or invoke multitasking should you pause slightly at the end of your gesture. This isn’t an issue for most of us, but the inconsistency leads to some frustration when moving between devices.</p>
<h2 id="inconsistent-gestures">Inconsistent Gestures</h2>
<p>Apple has slowly backed away from teaching users with its UI design. Gone is the “Swipe To Unlock” bar that Steve introduced with the first iPhone, replaced simply by “Swipe To Open” should you pause long enough on the lock screen, and it looks like you might need help. So ingrained is the swipe gesture that everyone seems <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/10/13/baby-magazine-ipad/">to know what to do</a>. Yet so many people couldn’t find the Control Centre, Apple needed to place a line as a little hint.
The line doesn’t say anything, or indicate anything, yet there it is. A now constant reminder that a swipe up from the bottom may not do as you expect depending on what device you have in your hand. Say what you will about the inconsistency between Android devices, but the toggles and navigation buttons are always in the same place.</p>
<p>Granted, things might look a bit different, but most UI elements do the same thing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5ktm6g/android_back_button_vs_iphone_no_button/">(bar the back button)</a> and users can move pretty easily from one device to another. Perhaps as the current device lifespans progress, all models will adapt the same gesture-based UI. However, if there is one thing Apple like, is changing things for no good reason. As a page-based Control Center became a weird one-page mess, there’s now no telling how you access it.</p>

<p>Posts from The Verge go from the brilliant to the absurd, but one call to arms is perfect for the new year. Vlad Savov has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/2/16727510/death-to-microusb">declared his independence from MicroUSB</a> and I wish we could all do the same.</p></p>
<blockquote><p>
USB-C connectors are sturdier than MicroUSB, they’re now more common among the very latest tech, and they’re only going to increase in prevalence and importance as time goes on. My way of simplifying my life in 2018 will be to just embrace and demand USB-C. I’m ready to let the old MicroUSB standard go, and I suggest you do the same – Vlad Savov, My new year’s resolution: no more MicroUSB
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thankfully it is only headphones that are the sticking point to make the Apple eco system free from of this elderly port, but I can’t work out why.</p>
<h2>Beats Studio And Solo</h2>
<p>I really thought we had made a leap forward with the Beats line. Since being purchased by Apple they held onto MicroUSB for a while but then the BeatsX arrived with Lightning and all was right with the world. Granted this wasn’t USB-C but it was a dam site better than a connector from 2007.</p>
<p>However the PowerBeats3, Beats Solo 3 and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/5/16254778/beats-micro-usb-cables-while-apple-goes-usbc-lightning">brand new Beats Studio 3</a> that followed are still equipped with MicroUSB. Perhaps Apple are reluctant to put Lightning into every Beats headphone, but there is absolutely no reason to still be using a Micro USB port on £300+ headphone released in 2017. This is especially true when considering the early push into USB-C with the MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>It’s arguable that we are taking about Beats Headphones and not Apple. It is unknown how much of a free entity the company really is, but given Apples ownership and advertising push they can be considered first party accessories. A whole load of accessories which Apple seem to be lacking courage with and need to push forward so we can do the same as Vlad. Down with MicroUSB!<br />

<p>The Verge summed it up perfectly in their post <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/2/16727238/apple-macos-ios-software-problems-updates">“Apple’s had a shockingly bad week of software problems”</a>. Apple have had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/01/apple-macos-high-sierra-bug/">twice fix a glaring bug with macOS</a> allowing access to machines, and also <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/12/02/apple-releases-ios-11-2/">date related reboot</a>s on iOS. It’s something that is becoming increasingly hard to stomach for users that have come to rely in the robust nature of the products coming from Cupertino. Unfortunately it also appears to be getting much worse.</p></p>
<p>It seems as though inherent traits appear the larger and larger that Apple become, and isn’t a uniquely Apple situation. The deterioration of Software standards and <a href="/post/2017-10-06-apple-design-failing/">hardware filled with compromises</a> resembles those of early 2000 Microsoft. Mix one large corporation with shareholders to satisfy, remove strong leadership and the result is a company that is removed from its user base. When you become more and more insulated from the outside world, and more and more people around you are simply employed to do as they are told, then you get less and less feedback.</p>
<p>Studio Neat have spoken about simular issues when <a href="https://www.relay.fm/inquisitive/3">talking to Myke Hurley</a>. They used Kickstarter successfully to not only fund products but also gage the reaction to them. Outside input is detrimental to making products that people actually want and not those that the team thinks they want. This will have been further impacted by Apples attempt to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/29/3051521/tim-cook-apple-will-double-down-on-secrecy-on-products">“double down” on security</a> which no doubt asks for much less external input due to the fear of leaks.</p>
<p>As a slap in the face, the vast majority of hardware leaks have <a href="https://www.byodpodcast.com/episodes/episode-29-democratisation-of-firmware-spelunking-with-special-guest-guilherme-rambo/25/11/2017">come from inside Apple</a>. I have no doubt that Apple listen to feedback, but how much can they really implement when the culture is so closed. Such is the trade off with using Apple hardware that you MUST be beholden to their decisions. If they begin to make wrong decisions, or those that are removed from what the user base really needs, then they have a serious problem.</p>
<p>There is a lot to be said about bugs being reported on social media and <a href="/post/2017-11-19-bugs-vs-noise/">the actually severity of them</a>, but these two bugs are inexcusable errors. I am one of the lucky ones, none of these issue have plagued me yet. However if I rely on my phone and the fact someone coded the wrong date won’t allow me to make important calls, I will soon be looking for an exit from the ecosystem.<br />

<p>It was long before the Apple Watch existed that I first slapped on a smarter wrist watch. As Garmin, Nike and Samsung were pushed aside for an Apple Watch- just one thing remianed. They have all pushed me to exercise better by keeping an eye on what I’m doing and giving me a kick when needed. Now that I’m using the third iteration of the Apple Watch, I really think it’s time for a rest.</p>
<p>By ‘gamifying’ activity Apple have found the market that really matters, getting more and more people moving inevitably leads to <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/apple-watches-are-dominating-the-wearable-marketcharts-2017-9">taking over the wearables market</a>. By doing so they have also implemented one of the most dangerous and addictive trends in fitness – streaks. Despite its popularity, this highly addictive pursuit of keeping the streak going can get people into trouble very quickly.</p>
<p>There is even a <a href="http://www.runeveryday.com/">United States Running Streak Association</a> (USRSA), which tracks people that run at least a mile a day “without the aid of crutches or sticks”. Adam Alters <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/irresistible/id1128615587&amp;at=100ltj4">book Irresistible</a> recounts several people that have gone to obscene lengths to keep this streak going, it doesn’t take a genius to work out why this is actually pretty bad for your health. The fact that USRSA needs to state you can’t use any aids should be warning enough not to start!</p>
<blockquote><p>Streaks uncover the major flaw with goal pursuit: you spend far more time pursuing the goal than you do enjoying the fruits of your success. – Irresistable, Adam Alter</p></blockquote>
<p>The pursuit and desire to exercise should come from within and not to make sure the yellow and the red line make a circle. Enjoyment and forfillment are one of the most important aspects in exercise and help immensely with improving mental heath.</p>
<p>Continuous activity is all very well, as long as it is sensible, and all the checks and balances are in place. If you’re injured, sick or just have more important things to do should you really be pushed and prodded to exercise?</p>
<h2>Dangers of the game</h2>
<p>Well that depends how sick. According to study in <a href="http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/45/12/987">British Journal of Sports Medicine</a> you should be fine pushing to your goal if it’s just a runny nose. However anything else should be treated with a few days rest along with at least a doctors visit. So iOS really shouldn’t be pushing you to exercise when you’re in no fit state to do so.</p>
<p>However keeping that streak going can be addictive as scrolling through social media. A couple of notifications with ‘motivational’ prodding could see some people heading to the gym when they really should be heading to bed. Rest and recovery is as important as the exercise you are completing. Doing too much is a recognised condition, and Overtraining Syndrome (OTS) can lead to reduced <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435910/">immune system, physiological and mental health issues</a>.</p>
<p>Hitting a move goal of a few hundred won’t lead to OTS, but the Apple Watch pushing you onto a higher and higher goal will. No one should be hitting their move goal everyday of the month. That is unless you are blazing past it 5 days out of 7 and just achieving it the other two. Unfortunately it seems Apple doesn’t want you to do that, achieve your move goal well and it will push you on to a higher and higher on. Whilst activity perusing a perfect month in September it pushed me from a 600 goal to one over 1000.</p>
<h2>Rest Day Solution</h2>
<p>If Apple want to do the best for their users, they must consider a rest day option in next years watchOS update. The option should exist for users to mark at least one day from 7 as a rest day and be pushed towards 1/2 of their usual tally.</p>
<p>This option is available already in a fashion, but is buried away behind a force press in the activity app. Users would be better served with the options being available from an Activity notification or clearly marked <em>Rest Day</em>. Doing so will enable those that have been pushed a little harder to achieve their move goal to get the rest they need, and also still allow those addicted to the game to keep the streak going.</p>
<p>There clearly needs to be limits set, there is no point users being able to mark every day as rest – however this could easily be linked to a set activity level or the move goal itself. Low (one rest day), High (two rest days) or any combination based on types of activity and stand hours.</p>
<p>Keeping people from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/11/health/sitting-increases-risk-of-death-study/index.html">sitting is vastly more important </a>than provoking slightly more exercise. However sitting down and resting one day a week would be best for all of us.</p>

<p>Whilst I have never been overly motivated to have a <a href="/post/2017-08-30-miss-dual-camera/">portrait mode capable handset</a>. Now I actually have the iPhone X I have enjoyed the odd occasion of trying out the feature. It definitely has some issues, especially using the front facing camera, but does get some great snaps. With that said I think Apple could do much better, and I can’t be the only one.</p>
<p>Self titled Apple analyst Rene Ritchie was critical of the way Google’s Pixel phones capture portrait mode shots. Although I can see the issue he is getting at, I think in many situations Google’s way could be better than Apples.</p>
<p>A picture should be as easy to capture as possible, and the increasing amount of camera options are getting in the way. The view finder is already cramped, and has not taken advantage of bigger screens on the Plus models and most notably the iPhone X. Apple lay out numerous camera options for live shooting, a few of which can be condensed or removed. Does the portrait option really need to be a shooting option? Also who shoots in ‘square’ any more?</p>
<h2>More intelligent shooting</h2>
<p>The Pixel way of applying the filter afterwards could be easier achieved and applied like HDR mode. The camera could and should be more intelligent and workout that this particular shot is a portrait and give me both pictures on the camera roll. Apple certainly has the ability to do this – according to some, Apple is <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/09/14/inside-apple-a11-bionic-and-silicon-team/">yet to take full advantage</a> of the huge potential inside the A11 Bionic chip.</p>
<p>I understand that it’s natural for those that have been using iOS devices for a number of years to think the Apple way is the best way. Settling on this decision simply because it’s the way you are used to is closed minded at best. In the case of portrait mode I think the ideal position is somewhere in the middle. Some indication that the image you are taking will create a portrait shot, but the processing and optimisation done afterward.</p>
<p>Users shouldn’t have to decide which ‘scene’ to use, or wonder if their snap will come out ok. Apple and others should be making these decisions for us and streamline the time from deciding to take a picture and pressing the shutter as much as possible. The options should indeed be there for those that want to tune the images to their liking. However in a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/benefits-shooting-auto-mode/">similar vein to all point and shoot cameras</a>, Apple need to develop a robust ‘auto mode’ and do all the hard work for the user.</p>
<p>Matt Birchler has <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/google-pixel-2-and-iphone-8-plus-camera-comparison/">been digging deep and comparing the differences</a> between Apple and Google between portrait mode approaches and it leads to some interesting comparisons. The great thing about Googles approach is that it will get better and better over time with little input from the user. Using services such as Google photos (unlimited <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/05/google-photos-pixel-2-limit/">back up until 2020 is given for free</a> with the Pixel 2) will clean up and improve the images over time. As always with anything Google there is a trade off with privacy, so for Apple any improvement would need to be done on device.</p>
<p>Portrait mode can be improved over time, and it is clear Apple are going all in on the dual camera so their attention must turn to improving the experience and the processing. Only then will the iPhone really catch up to the Pixel for ease of use.</p>

<p>Since <a href="/post/2017-11-06-apples-service-advantage/">collecting my iPhone X from Apple</a>on release day, my <a href="/post/2017-11-08-iphonex-impressions/">impressions of using the device</a> have gotten better and better. The size is perfect for me, splitting the difference between a <a href="/post/2017-07-17-smaller-phone-much-happier/">smaller phone in my pocket</a> and a larger screen to get things done. However the one huge sticking point in my enjoyment is Control Centre.</p>
<p>The notch has proved to be the most controversial design choice of the year. Yes it allows for more screen space but still packing in loads of new technology, but it also splits the status bar in two. Swiping from the left side brings down the cover page, and from the right reveals Control Centre. There is no way to change this so if you use your phone left handed you are in for a particularly palm stretching experience.</p>
<p>Whenever I stretch my thumb over by awkwardly shifting the fragile bit of technology in my hand I am immediately reminded of the Apple ‘thumb’ advert.</p>
<p>The demand for larger screens has meant Apple had to drop its previous stance, but without doubt this has lead to trade offs. Reachability is a work around for reaching areas of larger screens, but there is no denying that you must accept these trade off when choosing to use a larger device. With that said Control Centre is without doubt not one of these trade offs. The whole concept of this is to have toggles and quick launch options available quickly and easily.</p>
<p>It can no longer exist as a swipe up from the bottom as in previous generations, because this is now the gesture to go home, but even Android tried this interaction and it didn’t work then. The question is, where exactly could you put it?</p>
<p>There have been lots of options suggested for an easier accessed control on iPhone X, and it is clear Apple had other options on consideration. Guilherme Rambo uncovered a demo video inside the Tips app that showed the Control Centre as a page inside the multi-tasking view.</p>
<p>This would make it easier to access when using the phone one handed, but also add in extra gestures in order to access the ‘quick toggles’. Users would have to swipe up and pause (or another of the hundred ways people tell you to do it), then swipe over to Control Centre and then access the toggle they wish.</p>
<p>The best idea may be to adopt the same UI as with the iPad and build the toggles into the multi-task view. The app previews do not need to be a large as they are, and there would be plenty of space to add in extra content. The only downside to this would be access from the lock screen – so a quick fix isn’t easy to come by.</p>
<p>Lets hope I just become more used to Control Centre being more difficult to access, as let me honest, if the notch goes away in the next couple of generations then it will have to change AGAIN!</p>

<p>When Apple launched the Apple Watch, it was greeted with confused emotions. It tried too hard to be everything to everyone, however from watchOS 2 onwards the message has been clear. Notifications and health monitoring are the major benefits to everyone, recording activity levels and making users more engaged. Unfortunately from time to time the health data recorded is incorrect.</p>
<p>iOS should intelligently work out what device is being used and count from one device at a time. So for example if you have your iPhone in your pocket, but are also wearing your Apple Watch it will count steps from only one device. If you then put your phone down but keep walking, data is still recorded. However not all devices are equal, and iOS prioritises some more than others. If it values your phone above your watch, things can sometimes go a little wrong.</p>
<p>Thankfully there is an easy fix. Open up the Health app on your iPhone. Then tap the red Activity square. Tap ‘Steps or walking distance’, and then ‘Data Sources &amp; Access’. This will give you a list of all of your iOS devices that are recording health data. This could be filled with every device you have ever used, so could be a confusing mess.</p>
<p>In short, make sure all Apple Watches are above all iPhones. I have a huge long list of devices old and new – so I taped edit and moved all of my Apple Watches to the top and all iPhones after. This will make sure Apple Watch data is recorded at all times, unless it is not on your wrist. This should make your steps counts and activity levels much more accurate. Although if things are still not being recorded correctly you may have to look at other options – if in doubt <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb">speak to Apple directly</a>.</p>
<p>As a side note don’t remove any old or duplicate devices as this will remove the historic data from your Health app.</p>

     <p>For a long time the big blue F was my main social network for communicating with people, keeping up to date with news and just receiving boredom.

I’ve finally deleted my account for good, and not for the reasons you might expect.</p><p>There are may reasons to ditch Facebook. Huge concerns with the <a href="https://www.entitymag.com/11-creepy-ways-facebook-spying-right-now/">privacy of all of their mobile apps</a>, their apparent disregard for their involvement with fake news to name just two. Although it was a recent podcast from <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/esther-perel-online-dating/">Note to Self</a> that made me dig through the settings and find the delete account option.

I’ve missed messages and comments on photos that I have not replied to, simply because I don’t log in any longer. All most posts are from other apps such as Instagram or IFTTT recipes.

<p>After picking up my <a href="/post/2017-11-06-apples-service-advantage/">iPhone X on Friday</a> it was immediately apparent that the new Apple device is not going to be everyones perfect device. Despite sporting a fantastic 5.8” OLED screen, the iPhone X is going to frustrate users of Plus model phones – and there is still a huge case for the iPhone Plus.</p>
<p>The bigger sibling of each model of phone since the iPhone 6 is a love it or hate it device. There was initially a massive sales boost from those that looked at larger screened Android device with envy. Yet as bezels slimmed and handset footprints declined, the Plus was still a hulking great device. Apple gave the Plus a further selling point by upgrading the camera to a duel lens system with the iPhone 7, but adoption still slowed.</p>
<p>Since even before the iPhone 7, rumours have pointed to Apple ridding users of the home button and filling the device with screen. Many users waited with baited breath for Cupertino to deliver this promice. Thought it was another year before they released a redesigned and truly modern iPhone.</p>
<p>Even though the<a href="/post/2017-11-08-iphonex-impressions/"> iPhone X is a truly great handset</a>, there is still a massive case for users to buy a Plus model iPhone instead. Infact, bar the OIS fitted to the zoom lens, the iPhone 8 Plus is pretty much the same as the much more expensive iPhone X. Users that previously used a Plus device stand to miss out on a much wider and spaced out keyboard, and many landscape features.</p>
<p>Compared to its regular sized sibling, the usable screen size is much taller – but compared to the Plus model many users are going to be disappointed. It goes without saying that the taller aspect ratio is easier to hold but at the cost of a much larger typing space on the keyboard and well spaced out websites and apps.</p>
<p>There is no denying the Plus model phones are huge when compared to most modern handsets. However Apples insistence on using a wider screen won its self millions of fans. Unfortunately hanging onto a dated design a little too long may have lots it many more.</p>
<p>The iPhone. X is a brilliant mix of modern design, bigger screen and smaller bezels – but there is still a massive argument for using an iPhone 8 Plus. Don’t be swayed by marketing and Social Media hype. The iPhone Plus may just be better suited to you.</p>

<p>As you may or may not know I don’t bother <a href="/post/2017-07-07-ipad-pro-initial-impressions/">writing reviews anymore</a>. There are hundreds of great videos and long form pieces out there to satiate your appetite for that kind of thing. However I usually share my initial thoughts on using new devices – and here are mine on the iPhone X.</p>
<p>This unwillingness to spend hours wiring a full review is further exaggerated by the hype surrounding Apples new device. There isn’t much to write that hasn’t already been covered in one way or another. The hardware is top notch see what I did there) but I didn’t expect anything less. Apple’s design <a href="/post/2017-10-06-apple-design-failing/">compromises and hardware choices</a> may be questionable now, but their ability to <a href="/post/2017-11-06-apples-service-advantage/">make a customer feel</a> happy they are spending lots of money is undeniable.</p>
<p>The phone itself is another step forward in quality feel from previous iPhones. The use of polished metal and glass makes for an extremely premium feeling device. Anyone that handles it will feel like they are touching a thousand pounds worth of device. Using these materials does have a trade off in weight, the iPhone X is noticeably heavier than similar devices, this is without doubt a reassuring feel but it hurts my pinky when adopting my usual grip.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="iphone-x-notes-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8a4ce78c61.jpg" alt="Iphone x notes 1" width="600" height="300" border="0" /></p>
<h1><strong>Screen</strong></h1>
<p>The 5.8” OLED display dominates the front of the phone, this is no more obvious than when first powering on the phone. The white screen of the setup screen creates wonder and intrigue from the very first second. Combine this with the boost in resolution to 2436×1125-pixel resolution at 458ppi and the True Tone technology you have a device that not only looks but feels like the future.</p>
<p>Of course it isn’t, this is Apple playing catch up to the Galaxy S series but for an Apple user the brightness of an OLED that keeps the Apple colour accuracy tremendously improves the experience. Even in bright sunshine the screen is bright and easy to view.</p>
<p>The usable area of the handset is going to frustrate users coming from a iPhone Plus model, the keyboard does not have the space that the wider handset provides. Although I have found the device fantastic to use, I often write on my phone and have found it a much better experience than my previous regular sized iPhone 7. Apps and webpages are much more suited to a taller display, meaning the keyboard is a little taller and raised slightly towards the middle of the phone than previous models.</p>
<p>There is without doubt a blue shift when looking at the screen at very acute angles, it remains to be seen about burn in – but these are just the ofset things about OLED screens. The screen is stunning in every situation and the notch disappears almost instantly and is a complete non issue.</p>
<h1><strong>True Depth And FaceID</strong></h1>
<p>The notch allows for one of the most controversial features of the new phone, FaceID. By removing the home button and going all in on FaceID Apple have changed the way you use your phone. I am not a massive fan of this shift in authentication however it has meant that being more secure has faded into the background. It has worked flawlessly for me, all meant that I no longer have to think about pasting in passwords from 1 Password or entering secure apps.</p>
<p>As stared of for this, using the device flat on a table is slightly more awkward, and holding the device pointing at your face needs to become a habit. Going forward I have no doubt that this will improve, however as it stands right now it is absolutely fine.</p>
<p>The true depth camera has also allowed for portrait selfies, which works as described and also animating your very own emoji. Animoji is a unsurprising hit, if a little annoying for those that don’t have an iPhone X. I have no doubt this fad will run out of steam, but at the moment it is a enjoyable way to communicate.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="iPhone-X-Camera-portrait-1-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bb3d6b9491.jpg" alt="IPhone X Camera portrait 1 1" width="599" height="334" border="0" /></p>
<h1><strong>Camera</strong></h1>
<p>I wouldn’t go so far as to say I am disappointed in the camera, but it doesn’t offer anything over the camera on the iPhone 8 Plus. It does feature OIS on both of the lenses but I am yet to see any benefit to this. Zoomed images are still noisy and fail to capture quite a few snaps I have tried. I still default to using the wider lens and getting a bit closer, which is a real shame.</p>
<p>Focus also takes quite a long time to action, I feel the camera app itself is not intelligent enough for a modern smartphone and wonder if it is trying to do too much before taking a snap. Perhaps adopting an post processing model would make the experience better – and for the love of god please do something with the increased screen size!</p>
<p>Not even a week since getting the phone I would say I am very pleased with the phone overall. It doesn’t change the way the phone is used, bar the new gesture based navigation. This still takes a little too much brain power to remember, however this must remove ten years of muscle memory so I have no doubt it will sink in soon and feel natural.</p>
<p>Fundamentally it is still an iPhone and those that are Android users are not going to be attracted. However Apple have caught up to the pack now and sell a modern smartphone. For someone so on the fence about buying the phone I am very glad I did. I am not sure those that purchase their phone outright and have a modern iPhone should rush to upgrade, however if your in the market for an upgrade look no further than the X.</p>

<p>Don’t worry. Nothing PG here. Merely the fact that at any hardware launch it’s important to really appreciate the lengths Apple go to to make the phone feel the best it can. Even while picking the phone up in the Apple store I am steered towards the cases that are marketed in a colourful display near the back of the shop. Clearly cases have become a necessity – but I’ve spent at the least the first few hours with the phone ’naked’.</p>
<p>Since the iPhone 6, all of the hardware has looked it’s best nestled in a case. That’s not to say that it isn’t nice workmanship, but the camera bump has signalled the need for some neutrality. A case equals out the depth of the phone and means everything sits flush once again. Cupertino <a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2014/9/16/6209759/apple-has-an-embarassing-bulge">are no longer hiding the appendix</a>, and in actual fact leaning in quite a bit. However the fact is it feels better in a case, I really wish they would thicken the device inline with the bump and add in some extra battery – but Apple like to design small packages.</p>
<p><a href="http://darylbaxter.com/">Darryl Baxter</a> pitched this idea to me when he got his iPhone 8 Plus, so this time I’ve made a conscious effort to really appreciate the design effort gone into producing the device. Using it case less is a revelation, appreciating how much smaller and lighter the phone is, using it as Apple intended. Apple design <a title="Apple Design Excellence Is Failing" href="/post/2017-10-06-apple-design-failing/">may not be leading the pack as it once</a> was, but they sure know how to pack loads of tech into a slim device.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have the Space Grey version that <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/926392604501176320">shows finger prints</a> like you’ve been eating KFC. Not to mention the extremely high prices for damaging your shiny new handset. Apple repair prices for the front glass is £279 and replacing the back glass complete with wireless charging coil is more than £500! So even at £200 Apple care + might be a worthwhile investment if you plan on living naked.</p>
<p>So my new iPhone X is tucked away in its leather case and no doubt will stay there – but it was a nice experiment.</p>

<p>The once relied upon tech journalists that influenced purchasing decisions are up in arms that Apple let some lesser known people be the first to release their videos.</p>
<p>Videos by channels such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPYe5343jdQ">Booredatwork.com</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r51fE02IVRE">UrAvgConsumer</a> and even streetwear channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQphKeR-fCo">HighSnobiety</a> have made traditional tech reviews act like entitled rich kids. Quite a few You-tubers were invited to what appears to be Apple stores and allowed to release their videos a day or so before everyone else. This is a huge achievement and great recognition of a changing media landscape. Yet those having to wait until later in the week to publish theirs have a huge issue with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031040332/https://www.recode.net/2017/10/30/16577146/iphone-x-launch-teaser-video">Recode described the videos as</a> “a little braggy”, and criticised them for the fact they “don’t feel like gadget reviews at all”. Indeed these are not reviews you are looking at, they are hands on videos. Made during a few minutes with the devices (around 45). Most of those complaining have already had the luxury of attending Apple campus and sitting though the keynote as well as handling the phone already. Not to mention the luxury of more than a week using the iPhone X – but are they too blinkered to see these things.</p>
<p>Videos such as these won’t replace reviews from large publications like Arstechnica and The Verge, but supplement and add to them from a completely different angle. Subscribers to these channels are seeking real opinions on questions they have about the device. They don’t care about flashy effects and top notch editing, they want real opinions and lots of them.</p>
<p>An honest opinion that isn’t pressured by the fact that Apple gave them a device FOC. Or that a certain amount of clicks need to be achieved to balance the books. The vast majority of us had to spend a lot of cash to buy one, and will still review the device because we enjoy doing it.</p>
<p>The time has come to face the fact that “YouTube channels you’ve never heard of” have a much more relevant opinion than many tech publications. <a href="https://twitter.com/superscientific/status/925210521049223168">Most</a> are not wrapped up in their own bubble of self importance they miss what is in front of them. They tell the tale of what it is like to use the device, if only for a few minutes, and don’t get bogged down in this CPU and that Screen.</p>
<p>With that said this isn’t the time to start being snarky back. The claims that you are the “future of the media” can wait for another time. Those that got hands on should be proud of their recognition and feel humble. Keep doing what you are doing but most of all – enjoy it.</p>

<p>Since pretty much the dawn of time we have been looking for ways to make sure we are different from each other. Understandable when you’re competing for limited terrain or food sources, yet we still do it whilst wrapped up in an easy existence.</p>
<p>What once was tribal warfare, evolved into splitting ourselves based on arbitrary drawn country borders, and now the lines are draw over some of the most stupid reasons you could imagine. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/21/5307992/inside-the-mind-of-a-fanboy">So called ‘Fanboys’</a> are nothing new – Mac Vs PC, Xbox vs Playstation, Nintendo vs Sega, the list goes on and on. Yet the venom and vitriol spat by some people because they use a specific mobile phone is just stupid.</p>
<p>It only takes one issue to pop up on either side of the iOS / Android fence and it brings the worst out in people. Matt Bircher’s <a href="http://pca.st/episode/3f9cafcd-301a-4653-bd94-ba40da8777d3">“Birchtree” podcast</a> started this off with his talk about Android hating tweets in his time line, and I had an interesting debate with Paul on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqB56pzcYVo">Snappytech podcast</a>. I try really hard to not be biased towards one system or another, and understandably it is hard to not get carried away – I just wish others put in the same effort.</p>
<p>People are so <a href="http://m.androidcentral.com/airpods-android-seriously">emotionally involved in protecting their mobile phone operating system</a> it borders on bazaar. Yet the weird thing is I kind of get it, the need to belong to a group. The feeling that others share your common interests and beliefs is one of the most powerful things a human can experience. How exactly do you think extremist groups get people do weird and crazy things for weird and crazy reasons?</p>

<p>Hey, one of the most important things to me is my family #TeamMorris. For exactly those reasons, these are people that will love and protect me whatever the circumstance.</p>
<p>With that said, why are we intent on seperating ourselves out. Just because I am born here, doesn’t make me any different than someone born the other side of the world. We are all exactly the same except for the lives we have led up to that point. It makes zero difference based on skin colour, language we speak or where we live so why exactly is my opinion rubbish because I use one phone and you use a different one?</p>
<p>There is no pretending I use Apple products – almost all of them. However I have made a choice to do this because they fit in the best for me. The rate of Android and Apple fans that are over the top biased towards one thing or another is troubling. As Matt said in his podcast if you’re just a voice for one brand or another it simply makes you a much less interesting person to follow – so maybe that’s exactly what people will start doing.</p>

<p>For the last few days my Twitter feed has been awash with comments about the new Google Pixel XL 2 (or the Pixel 2 XL, I forget!). All of a sudden Android writers have split into two camps. Those that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/24/16519530/google-pixel-2xl-screen-issues-deep-and-unfixable">criticised the poor quality screen</a>, and those that <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/relax-about-pixel-2-xl-display">lept to its defence</a>. The truth is usually somewhere in the middle, but this screen debacle is only the tip of a very worrying trend creeping into manufactures.</p>
<p>Almost the whole industry seem to have adopted Facebook’s mantra of <a href="https://xkcd.com/1428/">”move fast and break things”</a>. Quality has taken a back seat to producing a product at least once a year, shipping it almost to the day of the last version. Google appear to have pushed out a phone with sub par parts, when in reality what they should have done is hold on a little longer and produce a quality handset. Unfortunately though this rush is not just portrayed by Google</p>
<p>Even the once highly held ‘Apple quality’ badge is starting to slip. FaceID and the notch seen in the iPhone X have a more than passing feel of a rushed production cycle. Many Apple users have been very vocal about the need for the company to really deliver a great new design this year – and we are <a href="/post/2017-10-06-apple-design-failing/">left with compromises</a>. The main worry is that these oversights will also be present in production quality, because Cupertino is also dropping the ball with its code.</p>
<p>Apples software has been on a downward trend for a while, suffering what appears to be the rathe of impatience even more. iOS11 has been <a href="http://www.techradar.com/how-to/ios-11-problems-how-to-fix-them">highly criticised as the most buggy</a> release ever, and <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/macos-high-sierra-latest-version-problems-fixes-features-compatibility-3647580/">High Sierra is not far behind</a>! Luckily these kinds of issues can be fixed and pushed out reasonably easily. However using sub par components tends to get found out pretty quickly – <a href="http://bgr.com/2017/07/07/oneplus-5-scrolling-issue-baffling-explanation/">just ask OnePlus</a>.</p>
<p>Is there a real need to throw out a new handset every year? The iterations from iPhone 6s to 8 haven’t brought any massive leaps, so the argument could be made that this is a self imposing cycle. The desire for Apple to produce more and more growth, and take in more and more revenue is only going to end one way. Either the cycle breaks, or the products do.</p>
<p>Now is the time for OEMS to take longer to produce hardware that is worth the upgrade. Handset prices have pushed upwards in the last couple of years with no meaningful reason to spend so much money. If build quality is the same at £300 and £900 then strong questions need to be asked.</p>

<p>Just incase you hadn’t gathered already, I really like Apple products. Not because I am some obsessive fan boy, but because (generally speaking) they all work together and achieve exactly what I want from my devices. Given this meek attachment I never feel the need to jump to Cupertino defence when they release products I don’t like, or do things that I think could be better. This is why <a href="http://byodpodcast.com/">the podcast</a> walks that line, and in actual fact I recent post on the <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2352/apple-is-really-bad-at-design">Outline that is very anti-Apple</a> makes many points I agree with. Apple design excellence that once existed is being eroded away and that’s a very bad position to be in.</p>
<p>Their own design choices of wiggly lines aside, I am always a little sceptical about these posts written to stir an emotional response. Do they really believe what they are writing or are all of these words written just for clicks. However Josh raises some very valid points (<a href="https://twitter.com/joshuatopolsky/status/879512768206053376?lang=en">something he didn’t with tweets surrounding the iPad Pro</a>) about the design and user experience of Apple products and I have to agree they are declining in quality.</p>
<p>I can forgive the Apple Pencil stuck in the Lightning port, I can also semi forgive a <a href="https://www.geek.com/apple/design-before-function-apple-magic-mouse-2-cant-be-used-while-charging-1636939/">mouse with a charging point on the bottom</a>, but when software and design choices actually make the device harder to use then questions should be asked. Issues with bugs in iOS11 are rife, the OS now contains a sudo lock screen that used to be a notification hub , and Control Centre has been turned into a grid of semi blobs with toggles in and it only looks to be getting worse with the iPhone X.</p>
<p>Removing a home button may allow Apple to squeeze in a large screen, but their are so many navigation items to include, users need to relearn everything they know about the iPhone. The developer of Overcast Marco Arment has a large job on his hands updating the app to work with the iPhone X. Changing the UI to work on gestures rather than buttons is all very well, but at the cost of hours of development time there are defiantly huge trade offs.</p>
<p>You could argue that this is too be expected when Apple change design, and it was a particularly painful experience for those that adopted the iPhone 6 plus early on. Unfortunately there is no argument against having to redesign the apps because Apple left a notch in the screen and didn’t design the UI around it.</p>
<blockquote><p>”Design isn’t just about beauty, its about market relevance and meaningful results” – John Maeda, former president of the Rhode Island School Of Design</p></blockquote>
<p>You can talk about <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/907764896829452288">website design and CSS safe zones</a> all you like, but the truth is these design trade offs in hardware and software are a modern Apple issue. We can sit around and muse over what Steve Jobs would of allowed the phone to look like, but I have a gut feeling he wouldn’t have liked it.</p>
<p>Design is not just what the device looks like, it is how intuitive and easy the device is to use. Design is not just an object, it is a sum of all the parts involved in any use, users are affected by the design choices made when designing the phone. If this is a confusing experience, with a notch cut out the screen that you are paying £1000 for then it doesn’t look good. Final judgement will come when the device finally goes on sale, but with more <a href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/09/28/iphone-x-reachability-support/">actions to fit into the UI</a> before sale Apple’s design dominance is really taking a battering.</p>

<p>My health and well being has always been a huge focus for me. I have been an avid runner, professional footballer and sport scientist but being active and healthy is increasingly hard in the modern world. The one thing that has helped me move more and weigh less is the Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Not to mention that when you have health complications and your doctor asks how active you are, it has proved invaluable to just pull out my phone and point to the screen. I honestly couldn’t see a life without this stupid thing strapped to my wrist, and would love others to embrace it.</p>
<p>The marketing spin was in full effect when Tim Cook referred to the newly released Apple Watch as “<a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2014/09/09Apple-Unveils-Apple-Watch-Apples-Most-Personal-Device-Ever/">The most personal device ever</a>”. All those hearing these worlds collectively rolled their eyes and waited for what it really does for you. The tech specs and the abilities are the main focus, however the personal angle has been far more important to me. This piece of equipment touches my skin for the majority of the day, and far outweighs the pokes and prods that my iPhone gets.</p>
<p>The truth is that I spend far more time interacting with a watch than I ever thought possible. The ever present three coloured rings have pushed me to move more, stand more and make me more in touch with my body.</p>
<p>After a long day, many of us would flop down into a chair and that would be the end of movement for the day. However more often than not, this is the time I stare at my watch and see I have been stationary for far longer than I think. Therese are the moments I fight with myself but ultimatly get my ass moving for 30 mins or more.</p>
<p>I’m always dubious about these things, and wonder if I have just been duped into a ploy to ‘gameify’ exercise. However I look down at myself and see the changes that have improved my life massively and I just don’t care. If filling a red ring everyday leads to me being much healthier, then so be it. Im a slave to those stupid rings, and I love it! Just please let me listen to <a href="/post/2017-09-23-podcast-watchos/">Podcasts Apple</a>!</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>There has been lots and lots of noise following the iPhone event on Tuesday, Which is one of the reasons I have left this post for a few days. As normal falling into two camps of opinion, which is always to be expected, however the prevailing narrative is that the iPhone x is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16291244/new-iphone-x-photos-video-hands-on">the future of smartphones</a> in a product made now – unfortunately this simply is not true.</p>
<p>The truth is that once phones like Samsung’s <a href="http://www.coolsmartphone.com/2017/06/30/a-mobile-love-story-comparing-the-galaxy-s8-and-the-lg-g6/">Galaxy S8, the LG G6</a> and various others from <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/09/mi-mix-2-designer-philippe-starck-talks-phone-design-bezels.html">Chinese OEMs</a> started hitting the market the traditional iPhone design became old. It was certainly iconic, but rooted in design and technical capability of a decade ago.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/63051934c9.jpg" alt="IPhoneX mockup png 1" title="iPhoneX-mockup.png-1.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="283" />Smartphone manufacturers are already producing handset of equal design and production quality equal to the iPhone X. The bitter pill to swallow is that Cupertino until now had been relying on legacy install base for sales results. The materials used and the manufacturing process may be a large step forward, but the design of the iPhone X shows that Apple is just catching up to the already high bar.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Apple have crammed in a huge amount of technology and achieved a screen to body ration that is <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/iphone%5C_x%5C_screen%5C_to%5C_body%5C_ratio%5C_compared-news-27264.php">leading the pack</a> – but does this really matter to users? FaceID although very impressive, feels a little too much like a compromise. Questions still exist if Apple believe this is the way we authenticate for years to come, or if it was developed simply because they couldn’t get TouchID to work under the screen.</p>
<p>Samsung beat Apple to a full screen handset and are set to have another crack at it in a few months time. Leaving Apple to inevitably play catch up once again. iPhone X is not tomorrow design today, it is todays design but a few months late.</p>

<p>As the saying goes, “Everything leaks”. Even as <a title="Tim Cook: Apple will &#039;double down on secrecy on products&#039; - The Verge" href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwievNWTpprWAhWFKMAKHZEYA5sQFggvMAE&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/29/3051521/tim-cook-apple-will-double-down-on-secrecy-on-products&amp;usg=AFQjCNF68aw2iuTrGn8uqoeQMSUQEo2MWA">Apple attempts to double down</a> on their security surrounding information leaking, readers of technology websites have been bombarded with information on the new handset. This started even before the iPhone 7 launched, but only a few days before the press event, the iOS11 build for the new phone found its way out, and apparently website shouldn’t be covering it.</p>
<p>For the last few weeks I have definitely <a title="Episode 19: You’ve triggered Cortana!" href="https://www.byodpodcast.com/episodes/episode-19-youve-triggered-cortana/9/9/2017">been experiencing leak fatigue</a> and admittedly the rate of leaks does spoil the event somewhat. However part of the magic is Apple executives filling in the gaps on stage. Walking through new features that are only on the new phone, and telling you how those features are going to fit into your life.</p>
<p>So leaking every last little bit of software <em>is</em> going to somewhat dampen the mood but that is just the tech circles we live in. Joe public will not care that some nerds found some code a few days before Apple talked about the phone. It wont stop hundreds of thousands of people watching the live stream, and it won’t dampen sales.</p>
<p>What you are really mad at is someone told you what you’re getting for Christmas. The outcry against publications <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/09/08/ios-11-gm-d22-iphone-8-details/">like 9to5mac</a> thats have “ruined Apple workers hard work” a few days before the event is laughable. Getting mad at a publication for doing so is like getting mad at rain clouds because you want to have a garden party.</p>
<p>Lets not forget most of the information was leaked a long time before that, bundled inside the <a title="HomePod firmware provides detailed look at iPhone 8 screen layout ..." href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqxrreqJrWAhUlIcAKHRkGDS0QFggoMAA&amp;url=http://9to5mac.com/2017/08/10/homepod-firmware-provides-detailed-look-at-iphone-8-screen-layout-resizable-home-button-more/&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBZir9huo8GA5NTItlZwZrEXzQtw">HomePod firmware</a>. Yet everyone was ok with that, it showed us almost everything about the phone bar a few details. Yet not so when this new leak rolls around, unveiling some interesting titbits but nothing revolutionary – it’s not as if they were going to put a <a title="Putting back the iPhone 7 headphone jack" href="http://www.gr36.com/iphone-7-headphone-jack/">headphone jack back in the phone</a>!</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a time limit on leaks, everything is fair game except for the last week before the event? <em>OR</em> maybe its time to just accept that things leak, the new iPhone is no different to Game Of Thrones episodes. Spoil or do not spoil, the outlook is up to you.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Sure enough, just after deciding that my workflow of using <a href="http://www.gr36.com/bear-and-ulysses/">Bear and Ulysses</a> to write all of my content was pretty much perfect – I’ve changed again. For the past week I have been exploring using Apple Notes instead of Bear now that iOS11 is about to drop, and it seems to be working very well.</p>
<p>The Stock Notes app on iOS has rightly got a lot of stick over the years. There are some people <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/ipad-diaries-optimizing-apple-notes/">that wouldn’t use anything else</a>, but many more users simply require a much more powerful app. <a href="http://www.gr36.com/bear-the-serious-notes-app/">Bear has filled that gap</a> for me since launch, making writing in markdown a beautiful experience and dead simple. However it always felt a little redundant paying for two subscriptions when they both do a very similar job. After learning how to improve lots of areas of my organisation through the <a href="http://www.gr36.com/learn-ulysses-writing-app/">Learn Ulysses course</a> this was even more the case, so I wanted a replacement.</p>
<h2><strong>Apple Notes in iOS11</strong></h2>
<p>With iOS11 Apple have improved Notes in many ways to make it more user friendly. Filing has become much more simple, drag and drop works flawlessly and the overall speed and app experience is much smoother. These improvements make it much easier to jot down quick ideas, saves links to look at later and even do some drafting if your heat desires.</p>
<p>What’s more I can use Siri to dictate a note I quickly think of, and unfortunately <a href="http://www.gr36.com/siri-falls-down-default-apps/">Siri cant do that</a> for every app at the moment. There is also the option to make hand written notes or annotations in line with text, add in images and lots of things you couldn’t do very well or the implementation was a bit clunky. One thing particularly useful is the ability to quickly launch the Notes app with an Apple Pencil double tap on the lock screen.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bb02dad611.jpg" alt="Image 05 09 2017 12 11 1" title="Image-05-09-2017-12-11-1.png" border="0" width="599" height="425" /></p>
<h2><strong>Downsides</strong></h2>
<p>I still miss a few things that can be found in more powerful apps. Tagging being the main one, as there is no way to organise notes other than in chronological order from last edited or Alphabetical. Folders are possible, however going backwards and forwards between them is not an easy task on iOS. This is partly made up for by a very fast and reliable search function, which even understands your handwriting if you’ve made some notes with the Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>The worst thing for publishing is Apple Notes app insisting on using a weird version of Rich text so converting to markdown is a pain. I created an <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/b75d1fc9f97e476d8a3e3765321184ea">Apple Notes to markdown Workflow</a> which automates the switch to Markdown, which is infinitely more friendly to work with for publishing. This Workflow also copies the resulting Markdown to a new sheet in my ‘ideas’ folder of Ulysses. I can then continue to draft this until I’m happy, add images and publish.</p>
<p>There is no X-Callback URL support in Notes what so ever, and the sharing of notes to other apps can sometimes go a little wonky depending on the app. However all in all the improvements made to app have made it a serious contender to be put back on many users main screen.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1bc9449bf0.jpg" alt="Apple notes iphone7 1" title="apple-notes-iphone7-1.png" border="0" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>I would like to see more user features in upcoming versions of Notes, perhaps the ability to change the font to something more readable. Proper Rich Text would be much easier to use than the current implementation, but I’d really love basic text or markdown support – although I don’s see that ever happening. However I would edge you to give notes another chance and see if the improvements make your life easier.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Does there have to be a reason to buy a bigger phone other than just a bigger screen? The Plus model of the iPhone has already proved a runaway success with users, but with the iPhone 7 Apple chose to give it something extra – another camera.</p>
<p>The big brother touted two camera lenses to aid zooming in on your subject, and also record depth information used to make any portrait subject really stand out with a bokeh effect. They made a huge deal about this feature when annoying the phone, and also in adverts, but it is hard form me to see the value without sacrificing stretching your palm and your trouser pockets.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=hcMSrKi8hZA">https://youtube.com/watch?v=hcMSrKi8hZA</a></p>
<p>The truth is as good as the portrait mode may be, the amount of times I have missed the other camera is next to none. Perhaps I am just able to get a bit closer to what I am taking a photo of. Maybe I simply don’t take the types of photos others do, but I wouldn’t give up a phone that fits in my pocket for a better zoom. What I really don’t need is yet another camera mode!</p>
<p>Having to worry about what setting to select to best capture the scene in front of me negates the whole point of having an easy to use camera. A camera app should be intelligent enough to know I am taking a portrait without having to access a specific setting. Applying the necessary blurring and bokeh as required and making it customisable to your preference.</p>
<p>Sure enough Apple is half way there, in portrait mode the camera app saves a copy of the photo without any depth effect. So why on earth can’t this happen in reverse like HDR photos? Hopefully Cupertino engineers have managed to stuff enough lenses and computing power into the new iPhone to make this camera more intelligent. However the delay in figuring out something that has been the staple of Sony cameras for a number of years is a little worrying.</p>
<p>Until then a simple, easy to use, single lens suits me fine, I don’t miss a dual camera at all.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Ding! One new post incoming.</p>
<p>I think everyone will agree notifications from your technology are annoying. Yet everyone puts up with them to a point where it’s just a haze of buzzing, beeping and dinging that rings in your ears for your entire waking hours. I have <a href="https://www.byodpodcast.com/episodes/episode-1-renders-of-leaks-of-lies/30/4/2017" rel="nofollow">talked quite a bit</a>about being engaged with the world and notifications are my next assault.</p>
<p>For the past couple of weeks I have been experimenting with tuning out all non essential notifications. Unfortunately the iPhone doesn’t have a notification system that is as intelligent as Android, but it allows for some tuning and minimisation. However this extends to tablets, computers and my favourite bit of technology smartwatches.</p>
<h2>The Apple Watch</h2>
<p>Previously a big advocate of the Apple Watch, the wrist strapped device has allowed me to be more engaged and silence my phone more often. Yet the action of checking my watch when it taps me on the wrist is almost a greater social faux pars than glancing at a phone.</p>
<p>Smart watches are more of a balance than other equipment in use. On one hand it allows the accompanying phone to be on silent much of the time and interruption for only important notifications. Yet on the other its a piece of technology strapped to your wrist for the sole purpose of solving a problem that is easier solved.</p>
<h2>Notification tuning</h2>
<p>This is a movement I want more users to be aware of, notifications are easy to control and manage straight from your handset. Only you can decide what you need to see, if you need it to beep, or if its important to you. Personally social media notifications are turned off for me, as are pointless app such as games and shopping apps.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/751a770039.jpg" alt="2017 10 23 notification screenshots 1" title="2017-10-23-notification-screenshots-1.jpeg" border="0" width="600" height="412" />These types of apps have a tendency to pop up notifications for little reason other than to get you engaged with the app again. Attention is the commodity the trade from and sell it to advertisers. If there is nothing important the app can tell you, switch them firmly to off!</p>
<p>The rest is up to you, experiment with what you need interrupting your life. Despite you t<a href="http://www.adweek.com/digital/needy-technology-too-many-notifications-causes-users-to-tune-out/" rel="nofollow">hinking that it doesn’t affect</a> you it’s surprising how much calmer and happier your life becomes from seeing less pointless information.</p>
<p>The only issue with this approach is the possibility of gameify your notifications. Constantly checking the app to see if you have any notifications. There is no way around overcoming this, the apps and screens we use are <a href="https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/what-is-technology-doing-to-us" rel="nofollow">specifically designed to keep us engaged</a> in them. Hopefully sanity will prevail and you will quickly realise that many of you beeps and dings are simply not useful to you.</p>
<p>There also needs to be some realisation from a user that it is also quite arrogant to think you need to answer every notification straight back. Not only in the self created bubble where you think that you are so important enough to warrant an immediate reply. Also that picking your phone up in the middle of being engaged in something else is amazingly annoying.</p>
<p>Without getting too critical and socially scolding this issues is almost socially accepted now. We all have a story of observing others who are too engrossed in another activity to be aware of what is around them. Yet the haze will continue until more people cut out the noise.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Since just before Christmas I’ve been questioning many things in my life and making improvements wherever I can. Not due to anything in particular, simply an attempt to make myself happier and more engaged with life. This has lead me to some great places. I have been <a href="https://medium.com/simple-words/me-meditating-yeah-right-be7ae66f1c5">meditating</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/simple-words/social-media-and-my-mind-77ade3309982">cutting down my social media use</a> and for the most part <a href="https://medium.com/simple-words/turn-the-phone-over-c72b99cbb58a">cutting down my phone usage</a>. Not only for the benefit of me, but also for the benefit of the people around me.</p><p>Around a month ago I made the decision to ditch my pocket busting iPhone 7 plus, and downsize. In fact I opted for something significantly smaller, an iPhone SE. The amount of questions I have received is quite shocking, but the answer to anyone wondering why, is both long and complicated.</p><p>I went into a reasonable amount of detail on an episode of the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/byod_podcast/episode02">Bring your own device podcast</a>. Which covers much of my feelings around my smartphone. This ultimately devolves into two parts. The first of which is why an iPhone SE and the second is why bother.</p><h3 id="why-an-se">Why an SE?</h3><p>Well I’m not adverse to using a smaller phone, I used an iPhone 5s (that is still in my draw) for quite a while. Yet I wanted the whole experience, I didn’t want to loose Apple Pay and the better camera so an iPhone SE seemed ideal. Couple with this the fact that the SE doesn’t seem to have maintained its resale value like other iPhones, I managed to pick up a 64gb version for just £200.</p><p>The IPhone SE is an amazing handset, especially given the price point that I picked it up for. It keeps all of the build quality, attention to detail and ability, yet reduces the strain on my pocket and my mind. However it is not all good news, there are some compromises to using something that is a few years old now. I miss the iPhone 7 new style home button, regular buttons now feel archaic, and the hardware is far from perfect. This most obvious of which is the low resolution screen and the battery life.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/d2005f6876.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><h3 id="why-bother">Why bother</h3><p>The real answer is very complicated, so strap yourself in for a bumpy ride. It’s going to get very preachy and very weird for someone so engrained in technology like myself. The reasons for which are not to dissimilar to my feelings surrounding <a href="https://medium.com/simple-words/the-dangers-of-being-a-phonehobo-d1db2fabd31a">not becoming an phonehobo</a>.</p><p>Currently the smartphone is both bringing us together and tearing us apart. That is not a local issue, it is a human problem, the smartphone is coming between human interaction is a huge way. We are not the humans from Wall-E on big floating chairs yet, but scientific research says we are not far away.</p><p>Research <a href="http://www.academia.edu/4661907/The_effect_of_smart_phones_on_social_interaction">tells us that the sheer presence of a smartphone</a> make interaction less meaningful for both parties and gives the illusion of neither party being engaged. It changes the very ideas we form when interacting and changes them for the worst. This is not a debatable occurrence, it is undeniable consequence of having this equipment around.</p><p>The fact is that most people won’t care, but when I am also responsible for two young kids that should feel my engagement with them as much as I do, then it is an issue for more than just myself.</p><p>I remember a time when I was mad that an Android phone I was testing didn’t get more than 4 hours screen on time. Even in a week that’s more than a whole day just staring at my phone. If moving from 5.5inches down to just 4” forces me to use my phone less, it’s a win for everyone.</p><p>The consequence of having a much smaller screen on my phone is that my phone is now a phone and not a computer in my pocket. The motivation, if not simply the ability, for me to do things on my phone is almost completely removed. I am much happier with a smaller phone, and I am not alone making this switch – give it a try and you might find the same.</p>

     <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>There can’t be many iOS or Mac app for note taking that I still haven’t tried. As soon as I’ve reviewed an app, gone through all the setting up process and made a choice to switch, I start looking around for other apps. I have a major fear of missing out on something that could be a better fit. Truth be told it costs me a fortune, subscription services or expensive one off payments seem to be normal now – but not with Zoho Notebook.</p>
<p>Notebook by Zoho is completely free, with a promise for it to always to remain so. There are no adverts, no add ons and nothing to pay – ever. That’s a big promise but the costs of supporting the app are maintained by the developers other projects. They make a lot of other products, but have a huge aim for this one, for it to be the best!</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-10-24-zoho-search-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0b09635ff2.jpg" alt="2017 10 24 zoho search 1" width="596" height="68" border="0" />Zoho set their stall out early and <a href="https://www.zoho.com/notebook/evernote-alternative.html">advertise themselves as a free Evernote alternative</a>. “Looking for an alternative to Evernote? we can’t blame you” sits proudly on their webpage, indicating very early their intentions. They truly believe Notebook is a much better app, available for free with “roughly 80% of Evernote’s features”. Notebook is available for iOS and Android with a <a href="https://www.zoho.com/notebook/notebook-for-mac.html">companion Mac app</a> should you wish to work on desktop to. This includes a safari plug in for working with webpages, unfortunately there is no web access as yet.</p>
<p>An app for Windows is also missing, so this can’t be considered truly multi platform and offer everything Evernote does. Although with that said the Mac app is a relatively new addition, missed from several reviews so it may come in the future. The Mac app also support the 2016 MacBook Pro Touch Bar, so you can tap through shortcuts and also secure your notes with Touch ID as you can on an iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p>They also promise that they will never, in contrast to Evernote, look at your notes or information. There is a conflicting back and forth whenever this is discussed, however if that practice is a concern of yours then Zoho is the place to go first. Bare in mind also that sync is provided by their own servers and not iCloud so there is a small compromise to be made.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-10-24-zoho-screenshot-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/81544cb9fc.jpg" alt="2017 10 24 zoho screenshot 1" width="599" height="398" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong><strong>Design</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The Evernote comparisons don’t just end with the applications intentions either. It is clear where they get the inspiration from, but if I’m allowed to be somewhat subjective they do a much better job of it. Notebook is often considered one of the <a href="https://gr36.com/zoho-notebook-review/thenextweb.com/apps/2016/07/13/zoho-notebook-prettiest-note-taking-mobile-app-youll-ever-use/?amp=1">best looking notes apps you will come across</a>, and I couldn’t disagree. The design and layout of every option is well thought through, if a little minimalistic. Great design is something that can become increasingly difficult when your app does as much as this one.</p>
<p>The main display of the app takes its inspiration from physical notebooks. Allowing users to split notes into different books based on whatever you wish. This could be the purpose of the note, or a category of your choosing. You can then customise these with its own front cover from a large selection and display the notebook to your own liking.</p>
<p>This is a design choice I have consciously stayed away from with other apps in the past and much prefer a traditional notes app display. There is no way to tag notes or display them on any other way than one notebook or another. This took a little getting used to, and feels a little strange. It is also worth noting that even on the iPhone 7 plus there is no landscape layout which is more than a little annoying.</p>
<p>Inside the Notebooks are your actual notes, displayed either by date or alphabetically. These are customisable with different background colours, although these can only be defined after creation. You can create simple text notes, but also drawings, voice memos and checklists. The display of the note is tailored for the note type, so audio is playable and images are very visible.</p>
<p>The four options to start a note are a little confusing at first, and it should be questioned if they are really needed. Notebook has the ability for a note to contain multiple note types, but you must start with a text note. So there is no ability to add text to a voice memo. Zoho should consider implementing a similar approach to OneNote and treat all notes the same, this would offer a much more understandable experience.</p>
<p>If you like to scribble down your thoughts handwritten notes are one of the most pleasurable things about Notebook. The developers have taken great care in making sure your quick doodles or jotted notes are taken care of. This works very well with the Apple Pencil, although you can use any stylus or indeed your finger if required.</p>
<p>There is nothing worse than spending ages looking for the note you previously made and Zoho does everything they can to make notes easy to find. There is no OCR on hand written notes unfortunately so search will only include your text notes but will search through all notebooks with perfect results on each version of the app.</p>
<p>You can also snap pictures, clip webpages and even add a full article into here – particularly handy if you read lots of webpages or store ideas all into one notebook.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-10-24-zoho-clipper-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e5b2cadc25.jpg" alt="2017 10 24 zoho clipper 1" width="600" height="413" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong><strong>Web Clipper</strong></strong></h2>
<p>One of the standout features of Notebook is their <a href="https://www.zoho.com/notebook/web-clipper.html">web clipper</a>, which is something that every app with at least some enterprise ambitions must include. You’re able to easily clip text, images and also entire articles and save them to your included unlimited storage.</p>
<p>When clipping a webpage there is an inbuilt option to clear the page of everything other than the article. Which removes those pesky ads and videos we all hate. This option could help some eliminate a read it later service or a long list of bookmarks. It works surprisingly well, equal to that of Pocket or Instapaper removing all adverts but also images. Although it lacks some customisation for reading options such as font type so couldn’t completely replace an offline reader for pure functionality.</p>
<p>However Notebook <em><em>could</em></em> very easily replace a service such as Pinterest for saving ideas around any subject all in one place.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Zoho Notebook Verdict</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The app is missing out on too many features for <em><em>my</em></em> personal use, but I do wonder how many people pay for a service such as Evernote and would be perfectly fine with this app. However there are some things missing to truly complete with the large services people use.</p>
<p>Much of my cons with the app are related to my specific use case. I would love to see a tagging and labelling system rather than based on traditional books. There is no way for me to add a note to more than one book, which might seems strange but some of my text needs to be displayed in multiple places.</p>
<p>There is also no collaboration or sharing available within the app with sync only provided by their own servers. Notes are not kept in iCloud or Dropbox so your pretty much locked into the service once started. There is also no URL scheme support available which is detrimental to my Workflow and therefore iPad usage.</p>
<p>With that said this new upstart in an already very crowded area is a welcome addition. If you <em><em>are</em></em> looking for something free, easy to use and with simple features there is no point looking anywhere else than here or <a href="http://www.gr36.com/google-keep-as-a-writing-tool/">perhaps Google Keep</a>. The future looks very promising for Zoho Notebook as this is still a new app in development, so I will be keeping an eye on them with interest.</p>

<p>I know, I know I’m calling for Siri to get better again. Yet nothing has brought the downfalls of Apples voice assistant to the forefront than spending some time using Apples new AirPods. There has always been issues with using Siri and granted Apple are working hard at <a title="An Exclusive Look at How AI and Machine Learning Work at Apple" href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWrP_V5dTSAhWE5xoKHZzMCc0QFggsMAI&amp;url=https://backchannel.com/an-exclusive-look-at-how-ai-and-machine-learning-work-at-apple-8dbfb131932b&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8hMDNtNSohTpPBzNPtSfy29JzBQ&amp;sig2=RiS8nvxuJHA9--fE2b0avw">fixing and improving things</a>, but Apple are now so far behind others is it possible to catch up?</p>
<p>Truth be told I have never been a huge user of Siri, it was great to show your friends when Siri was first released with the iPhone 4s. I even gave it another shot when I could just yell “hey Siri” at <a title="Use Siri on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch - Apple Support" href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB8qrm5NTSAhUEnRoKHUmsBswQFggcMAA&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204389&amp;usg=AFQjCNGS_TIe4zlbW4Rl9b2oPKyxI2nR4A&amp;sig2=v258Ui_ux9QaFqoBw1oK5A">my phone after installing iOS 9</a>. Nevertheless it almost always devolves into an argument with myself, at which point I pull out my phone and simply tap away like some kind of cave man. Some personal assistant you are.</p>
<p>Siri being a dumb ass isn’t really the issue. The improved microphones found in the AirPods, coupled with the fact they are next to your face, means voice recognition is actually pretty good. The problem is in fact that Siri can’t do half the things users need from an assistant – and isn’t actually useful.</p>
<p>This is none more obvious when you use anything other than Apples own apps that come with iOS. Apple may have given users the opportunity of deleting their apps, and finally ridding yourself of Stocks and Voice Memos – but iOS still tries to use them at every turn.</p>
<p>Want to take a note in <a title="Bear: The Serious Notes App" href="http://www.gr36.com/bear-the-serious-notes-app/">the brilliant Bear app instead</a>, nope. I’m putting a note in an app you don’t use titled ‘Bear’. Think you can dictate an email to Siri to send in AirMail – you’ve got another think coming.</p>
<p>Why make all of these things possible if only half of that is actually true? Apple made the AirPods so reliant on voice that there is no other way to change the volume levels, yet didn’t think the whole thing through. Most users no doubt wouldn’t even dream of using anything other than Apple mail, Notes or Reminders but Siri is so dumb it doesn’t even know the apps are gone. That is until it pauses for a few seconds like a puppy wanting to know where the magic stick has gone; only to realise it’s behind your back.</p>
<p>Returning not with what you asked for but a solemn “I’m sorry I can’t do that”. Well what actually <strong>CAN</strong> you do Siri because I can’t find much past turning my music up.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The shocked look when I tell people that my primary computing device is an iPad is brilliant. I’ve actually been working on an iPad for a little over two years, and have replaced pretty much all of my computing with an iPad. First with an iPad Air 2 and now with a 9.7” iPad Pro.</p>
<p>With pretty much the same argument to working on a Chromebook, people are too eager to dismiss the iPad as a computer. When the truth is it’s actually pretty easy. With a little investment in software and some time invested in setting things up the way that suits you best. You can do. Out of your daily tasks with little thought, but dig in deep and you can do 99% of your requirements on one device.</p>
<p>Quite a few of my <a href="http://darylbaxter.com/">friends have adopted the same approach</a> now the iPad has a great keyboard case, and use it as I do. Unfortunately most people don’t want to put in the time and are often dismissive, however I really think more people should embrace the iPad as a computer.</p>
<h2><strong>Apps to do anything</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s be honest, as great as iOS10 is there are still holes in Apples OS. Thankfully most of these are filled by the rich app ecosystem. I have spent far too much money on apps over the years, and unfortunately most of the expense has been on apps that I no longer use. Reviewing the use case of new apps, trying things out and experimenting. Only for it ultimately to fall short in some area, not meet my needs or very often become superseded by something better.</p>
<p>I never have many apps on my iPad, but what I do have installed are used often. I made the mistake very early on of carrying around a replica of my iPhone on a bigger scale, but quickly realised there is no need. Both devices have completely different uses and should be treated as such. Don’t flood your iPad with social and communication apps unless you intend to use them often.</p>
<p>With that all said there are a few apps I can’t do without:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workflow</li>
<li>Ulysses</li>
<li>Notes – <a href="http://www.gr36.com/2017-01-19-bear-app-review/">now replace by Bear</a></li>
<li>Documents</li>
<li>Medium</li>
<li>Pocket</li>
<li>Notability</li>
<li>Day One</li>
<li>Linky<br />
These apps are the ones used daily, when writing or reading. I have a lot of media apps for watching movies or TV shows at the gym or while traveling, but your use case will vary. I will not go into extensive details about everything I use, but give you a shallow overview, if you want to dig in deep check out <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/working-on-the-ipad-one-year-later-still-my-favorite-computer/">MacStories second update on</a> using an iPad Pro.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Automation</strong></h2>
<p>This is where almost everyone I speak to falls off and sticks to more traditional means. Maybe it’s because things are easier, maybe it’s muscle memory, maybe there isn’t a real reason, but users fall by the wayside quite early. However with a little work and research you can pretty much achieve anything you need from a computer and often make it much more straight forward.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a74515050d.jpg" alt="Ipad pro workflow 1" title="ipad-pro-workflow-1.png" border="0" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h3><strong>Workflow</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/workflow-powerful-automation-made-simple/id915249334?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4">Workflow is not complicated</a> nor confusing it just takes a little time investment and reading to get the hang of it. I’ve been using the app for more than a year and it is the best app I have ever bought, it is the cornerstone of much of my productivity.</p>
<p>Think of Workflow as Automator for iOS, plugging into countless (but not every) app and making things much easier. It works by creating recipes by dropping actions together. You can then feed information into the recipe, ‘run’ them and get your desired outcome.</p>
<p>I have invested time in making Workflow recipes or finding <a href="https://workflow.directory/">them in other people’s blogs</a> and making them my own. They do all sorts of things for me, from resizing images for publishing to wrapping my screenshots in device frames and stitching images together.</p>
<p>My most used of which isn’t my own work but I have modified it slightly for use on my blog. Jordan Merrill created a screenshot builder for you to easily import into your own set up, the full guide is easy to follow and can be <a href="https://www.jordanmerrick.com/posts/screenshot-builder-workflow/">found here</a>. You can also achieve a similar result using the <a href="https://appsto.re/gb/42_C2.i">app LongScreen</a>, select your screenshot and tap the magic wand at the bottom.</p>
<p>I also use several workflows for resizing images for my featured image sizes and also <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/b4f8cf8ce27841b2a5624d84c83d7d3a">combining my device images together</a>. However these are only a small selection of workflows that I use, over the last year or so I have built up an armoury of resources. Allowing me to adapt or create recipes for many of my daily tasks.</p>
<p>There would be no point sharing many of these as they would be unique to my image sizes etc, but they are pretty easy to create with a few minutes digging in. If you are serious about using Workflow there is no better resource than the <a href="https://club.macstories.net/">Club MacStories newsletter</a>, for the small subscription you get access to all of the content created from which there are hundreds of ideas.</p>
<h2><strong>Notes, words and writing</strong></h2>
<p>The title of this post started of as “running my blog from an iPad” because that is exactly what I do. I spend most of my time writing on my iPad or digesting what I am about to write. I have used many apps over the years, starting on Google Docs, graduating to the markdown editor Byword. I now use the amazing if a little expensive Ulysses app.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c2d13a3591.jpg" alt="Ipad pro ulysses 1" title="ipad-pro-ulysses-1.png" border="0" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h3><strong>Ulysses</strong></h3>
<p>There must already be millions of words already written about Ulysses, it is considered the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ulysses/id623795237?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4">pro wiring app on Mac</a> and only relatively recently <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ulysses/id950335311?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4">came across to iOS</a>. I resisted for a long time purely down to price, and the fact that at the time Byword was a perfectly good Markdown editor. Yet the move was smooth and a very rewarding one.</p>
<p>The deciding factor was publishing. Ulysses allows me to see exactly how an article will look before publishing. Although publishing to WordPress is available from a few different apps, compatibility and preview where always not quite right. Meaning I had to use the a webpage or god forbid the awful WordPress app to correct things. Whereas I can input local images into a document and they will be uploaded along with all of the text.</p>
<p>Organisation and syncing in Ulysses is also second to none, allowing for articles written on any device I own, syncing to all and organised exactly as I wish. Most other Markdown apps use an iCloud folder sync that can be slow and very unreliable. Not to mention that dumping all of the files in one folder means trying to find an old file can be a nightmare.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c0b0f9c3f2.jpg" alt="Ipad pro bear 1" title="ipad-pro-bear-1.png" border="0" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h3><strong>Bear</strong></h3>
<p>The regular old stock Notes app that has been my place to store everything has recently been replaced with Bear. By calling Bear a notes app it is much more approachable. When in reality it is a Markdown editor at heart. Allowing you to add in formatting while typing, for sharing later or simply for your own use. With a couple of key strokes you can add in links, headings, tick boxes, and even images.</p>
<p>Bear has been expertly designed in both aesthetics and function. All of your notes are listed on the left hand menu, which can be accessed with a right swipe. Once you are editing or looking at a note the developers have made all of the formation options available in a shortcut bar above the keyboard. This sounds a simple thing to do, but lots of others hide these away behind a formatting menu.</p>
<p>I have slotted Bear in between my current writing app of choice, Ulysses, and my brain. It gives me the ability to format and position text in a small light weight app before moving them to Ulysses for images and publishing.</p>
<p>I also use Notability quite often for hand written notes, these are usually more work related than writing but there is something really great about hand writing notes. The Apple Pencil also allows me to jot down things if the mood strikes me, although I have found myself not using these as often as I expected. Should the new iPad Pro be launched with a new Apple Pencil I will think twice about punching it as this just isn’t what I have used my iPad for, although many people use it daily.</p>
<h2><strong>Documents app as a document picker</strong></h2>
<p>The cry from those dismissive of a productive iOS user is that you can’t do anything without a file system. Unfortunately in the past this may have been true, but since iOS 8 users have been able to do much more and very easily. The introduction of iCloud Drive with iOS 10 is the closest users have come to a file system, and is already proving to be really useful.</p>
<p>Not only because syncing of documents is much easier, with far more file types supported. With this has come syncing from a mac computer of all users documents into ‘the cloud’. Meaning working from anywhere is possible, whatever you are doing there is a wealth of apps out there to help.</p>
<p>With that said the major upside to making the ‘drive’ part of iCloud more accessible has been allowing apps to use the storage area to manage files much better. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/documents-5-file-manager-pdf-reader-and-browser/id364901807?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4">Documents by Readle</a> is an essential app for users wanting to work with specific files and be productive.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cfa3c836d9.jpg" alt="Ipad pro documents 1" title="ipad-pro-documents-1.jpg" border="0" width="597" height="181" />This plugs in perfectly with PDF expert, which is an essential if you work with PDF like I do. I can open, read, edit or sign documents and email them back. Whereas in the past I would have to print off pages, to then scan them back onto a file again.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to use iCloud, or you have to use storage elsewhere then Documents can grab documents from Dropbox, Google drive, Box, One Drive and almost everywhere else including an FTP server. The design could do with an update, but it is functional and works perfectly – which is exactly what’s needed.</p>
<p>Documents can manage almost any file type, allowing users to open, edit and send them inside the app. It even allows you to download and extract zip archives from web links using an internal browser. File management is still not desktop class, but I would argue that it really doesn’t need to be. Ask yourself what you actually need to do with the files on your desktop or laptop and I would say 70% of that can be done on iOS.</p>
<h2><strong>Medium and reading</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve been publishing everything for the past year or so to Medium. My personal blog, tech stuff and also posts that I’ve started writing about my daughter and her life with a disability. When I first decided to do this, Medium was fresh and new, with a growing reputation of the place to be. I loved that they had control about how things looked, not only because I didn’t have to work maintaining and managing a theme for the site, but also because everything looked the same.</p>
<p>It was a place I went to read things, and so did many many other people. Open the app and there was a wealth of available content that was relevant to what you like. Medium expanded my reach to people that had no idea about my website, but perhaps read the same sort of things as I produce. I let their trusty algorithm serve up my posts to people it felt would read it. A win on all sides whichever way you looked at it.</p>
<p>Even though this has changed over the last few months there is still lots of interesting articles that people publish to the platform, it is a staple app for digesting content. The iPad app is also a really nice writing app to publish from, even though I use Ulysses the Medium app stands up pretty well it terms of usage.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f9699356bc.jpg" alt="Ipad pro dayone 1" title="ipad-pro-dayone-1.png" border="0" width="600" height="300" /></p>
<h2><strong>Journaling on Day one</strong></h2>
<p>For the last couple of years I have gone backwards and forwards with journaling, both in the digital and physical sense. I am no longer writing in here, although it is a great app if you want to write and even publish a blog from here. My usage is as a scrap book to store links to everything I write and pictures I post.</p>
<p>Along with IFTTT recipes I have stored everything I post for every website I write for, and also Instagram photos. As I produce more and more content on the digital web Day One keeps a record of all this, dated and linked for me to look back on.</p>
<h2><strong>Pocketing things to read later</strong></h2>
<p>The reason my iPad is so useful to me is because I can fold it out into a writing device with keyboard and tap away until my hearts content. I can do this for hours with great battery life and then simply fold it up and slip it into a small sleeve in my bag. Yet the greatest thing is pulling the keyboard off and just relaxing, reading a book or more often than not catching up on my <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pocket-save-articles-and-videos-to-view-later/id309601447?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4">reading list in Pocket</a> .</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/05ad76678c.jpg" alt="Ipad pro pocket 1" title="ipad-pro-pocket-1.png" border="0" width="600" height="300" />I have gone backwards and forward with read it later services over the last few weeks, but in reality there is only two to be considered. Pocket or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4">Instapaper</a>, it is that simple. I recently switched away to Instapaper, and even <a href="http://www.gr36.com/how-to-move-from-pocket-to-instapaper/">wrote a guide on how to do it easily</a>, but after some issues with Instapaper syncing I’m back using Pocket. The social sharing and also the recommended articles are a great service where you can discover things that may have slipped you by.</p>
<p>Setting this up with IFTTT recipes for sharing is dead easy, and you can even follow your social media friends to see what they are recommending and widen your reading circle.</p>
<h2><strong>Sharing with Linky</strong></h2>
<p>I discovered Linky <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/linky-adds-a-more-powerful-share-sheet-to-ios-8/">completely by chance whilst looking</a> for something to share links on a business twitter account I manage. This simple app is one of the most straight forward but yet the most confusing if you dive straight in. In broad terms it is a share sheet app that allows easy sharing of information to multiple accounts on social mediate in recent updates it has gained lots more features.</p>
<p>When opening the app you are greeted with nothing but a browser, yet its real power comes from the share sheet. This is indispensable to me for sharing to more than one twitter account, but also for clearing Apple News links! This caught me out several times when sharing interesting articles, meaning people on other platforms cannot read them, nor can people that have removed the app.</p>
<p>When sharing from inside Apple News Linky will find the regular link and share that instead.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/92cd4e9ae7.jpg" alt="Ipad pro linky 1 1" title="ipad-pro-linky-1-1.jpg" border="0" width="599" height="241" /></p>
<h2><strong>Can’t Do’s</strong></h2>
<p>Unfortunately the iPad just cant do everything, there are some things that a desktop type browser is essential and no amount of mediating with Documents will work. This ranges from simple things such as options and menus not appearing on mobile safari version of web pages. Right the way through to recording audio whilst taking part in a podcast.</p>
<p>These types of things crop up in the most annoying places, such as my resent adventure <a href="http://www.gr36.com/how-to-move-from-pocket-to-instapaper/">moving from Pocket to Instapaper</a>. There are also gaps in the armoury that is provided by the App Store to. For example the desktop version of Garadgeband is a great app for editing podcast audio, yet the iPad app doesn’t even entertain the idea.</p>
<p>There is still no option for these few very important use case of mine. So sitting in front of a Mac is still unavoidable for some tasks. Although these issues are decreasing more and more over time. Using an iPad is less about computing power and more about versatility. Perhaps this is the reason many Windows laptop have taken the convertible route? I am more than certain we will never see a convertible macOS device, but we already have a brilliant iOS one.</p>
<h2><strong>Using an iPad</strong></h2>
<p>As more and more people realise that much of what they need to do on a ‘computer’ can be done on less traditional hardware the world changes. The frustration is users being put off by media commentary before they have ever tried using one, the same headlines written by tech blogs are regurgitated by end users. I see the same people argue that you can’t work on an iPad are many of the same supporting the use of a Chromebook.</p>
<p>I would challenge everyone to find many use cases where you can’t use an iPad for most of your computing tasks. The iPad offers unrivalled battery life for usage whilst traveling, combined with something that is lighter than any laptop available.</p>
<p>The OS and extensive suite of apps in many ways are more capable and straight forward than a desktop OS. If you want to make the most of using your iPad as a computer, it doesn’t have to be an iPad Pro at all. Yet you will need to spend a bit of time deciding what you want to use it for, and open your mind to the possibility.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’m starting to think I have a problem, I just can’t leave things alone. Once I find a great app that does what I need, I write the review and then start looking at other options.</p>
<p>Days after finding <a href="http://www.gr36.com/bear-the-serious-notes-app/">Bear to write everything from short notes to full posts</a> I was eyeing up other Notes apps. I decided to give Google Keep a try and it is actually pretty good. Not really as a notes app, but for reminders and todo lists.</p>
<p>I’m sure it makes a very good notes app for those quick little notes you occasionally need. The whole UI is based around post it notes after all, yet it doesn’t hold a candle to other notes apps in terms of features.</p>
<p>You can attach images, voice notes and URL’s but only one per note. Users can also forget about any kind of formatting or inline linking, but these features don’t feature in the stock iOS app either. It is only third party options, that usually come at a premium, that leave Google Keep in their wake. With all that said it does everything <em><em>most</em></em> people will need to do. Doing the simple things very well indeed and syncing notes to iOS, Android and the web.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a87972beab.jpg" alt="Google keep screenshots 1" title="google-keep-screenshots-1.png" border="0" width="599" height="398" />Google are great at keeping everything simple and easy to understand, doing a great job with the Keep app. Everything is controlled from a left hand menu accessed using the ‘hamburger’ icon in the top left. The design is very Googley, using their own material design but still following an iOS familiarity. The design won’t be to everyone taste, yet it holds a certain charm.</p>
<p>The simple design allows it to handle reminders and todo lists perfectly. It is a breeze to add straight forward notes or customise them with Labels, reminders and colour schemes should you feel the need.</p>
<p>It is surprisingly convenient to use, and in many ways punches well above it’s weight when compared to many todo apps. The app is also completely free which is a major bonus, considering the cost of most iOS todo apps seems to be £20+. You will need a Google account though, so nothing after that point is ever completely free.</p>
<p>By setting up labels for Writing, Home and Work; heavy use of tick boxes and reminders I have managed to set up a use case that is very similar to my Todoist setup. If you are in two minds if to stump up the cash for a year of a power todo app it might be worth checking out Google Keep first. It could very easily save you quite a bit of money per year.</p>

     <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Notes apps are a strange thing to review. Everyone already has one built into iOS, and the vast majority of people will never look anywhere else. I was one of those people until I was able to delete first party apps, and <a href="http://www.gr36.com/todoist-review/">much like replacing reminders with Todoist</a> – I’ve replaced Notes with Bear. Here’s my review.</p>
<p>By calling Bear a notes app it is much more approachable. When in reality it is a Markdown editor at heart. Allowing you to add in formatting while typing, for sharing later or simply for your own use. With a couple of key strokes you can add in links, headings, tick boxes, and even images. However if that is too much for your brain to remember there are shortcut buttons at the top of the keyboard.</p>
<p>Whether you are jotting down a quick note to yourself, or starting a long page of prose, nothing will disturb your writing. Images can be inserted and formatted to your liking, meaning that as you type you will be looking at exactly how the document looks. This wont make a blind bit of difference to simple notes, but perhaps it’s time to take even your personal notes to the next level!</p>
<h2><strong>Subscription Model</strong></h2>
<p>Like many pro apps available now, Bear adopts the freemium model. The app is free on all platforms, with a monthly or yearly subscription to unlock pro features. Your use case may or may not need these features but they include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sync</strong> all your notes between Bear for iPad, iPhone, and Mac. Powered by CloudKit. Learn more about Bear’s sync and autosave in Organise and publish.</li>
<li><strong>Export</strong> your notes to a variety of formats for publishing and sharing elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Beautiful Themes</strong> – eight at launch, and more to come, to give you just the right, comfortable environment for your creativity to flourish.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are unlocked via a single subscription that covers all your devices, paid directly through the App Store. If you want to try out the Pro features you can claim a free week by signing up for the subscription, so you won’t be charged for the first week of use. So if you try it and don’t like the app, cancel before that time and you wont be chanted a penny.</p>
<p>For the benefit of the review I will looking at the best version available, so I will be testing the Pro version. Bare this in mind during discussion of things like sharing if you don’t want to pay the £1.49 a month or £13.99 a year subscription. To me the subscription is well worth it for sync and the sharing options, but take this into account before jumping in.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="bear-review-premium-1-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/17549e07fa.jpg" alt="Bear review premium 1 1" width="599" height="353" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>The Good Looking Notes App</strong></h2>
<p>Rarely do you discus the design and UI of what appears to be such a simple. Yet Bear is one of the nicest to look at and simplest to use apps I have come across recently. Often the pretty facade quickly slips when you are searching for options or digging into menus to find things hidden for no good reason.</p>
<p>Bear has been expertly designed in both aesthetics and function. All of your notes are listed on the left hand menu, which can be accessed with a right swipe. Once you are editing or looking at a note the developers have made all of the formation options available in a shortcut bar above the keyboard. This sounds a simple thing to do, but lots of others hide these away behind a formatting menu.</p>
<p>Bear takes on exactly the same design in its companion Mac app, which is also available for free. The Mac app <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/faq/Shortcuts/Mac%20shortcuts/">supports loads of shortcut keys</a> but as yet doesn’t support any touch bar keys if you’ve updated to a 2016 MacBook Pro like I have. This is a shame, as other apps such as Ulysses has already pushed into this field, but it will only be a matter of time, so double check as they may have updated after publishing this review.</p>
<p>You only realise what is lacking form other apps when an app does it right, instantly clicking and fitting into your workflow. Remembering shortcut keys is sometimes confusing, and they are never universal! So making shortcuts easily available makes it much easier when first writing in the app. You can of cause use CMD+ shortcuts on the iPad with an attached keyboard to.</p>
<p>There are 8 different design options available in the app with more to come, including a dark mode for those that like using black. With that said design is more than just making things look pretty, as John Maeda says it is about meaningful results. The right balance of beauty and usability has been made here, the great design leads to a pleasing to use experience and an easy to understand menu and note organisation method.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="bear-review-screenshots-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0811410308.jpg" alt="Bear review screenshots 1" width="599" height="398" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>Tags</strong></h2>
<p>If you already use a powerful note taking app or service you will more than likely already use tags profusely. Tags, or any kind of organisation features are drastically lacking from the stock app which is annoying because these features are what make taking notes in an app so useful. By adding a simple # in any part of your text you can link similar notes together without fuss.</p>
<p>Bear will then list all these in the side of the menus, making them easy to edit and easy to find what you are looking for. Quickly falling into this practice as a writer is easy, with different publications linked and also tags for ideas and work in progress (WIP) articles.</p>
<p>The use of the hashtag is instantly recognisable to an Evernote user, <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/faq/?q=migrate">you can even migrate all of your current notes pretty easily</a>. The hashtag also makes tagging your notes instantly accessible to all, pretty much every smartphone users know how they work.</p>
<p>Users are also able to nest tags with ease, so organisational options really are limitless. By adding / to the tag you can organise until your hear is content. My article # now has article / ideas and a article / wip nested tags.</p>
<p>What your notes app contains is really up to you, and something that is as unique as the apps you use to get things done. Some users purely want a note pad and nothing else. If that is the case Bear will offer you a much better method of organising your notes. However the subscription may be expensive purely for this.</p>
<p>Whereas I use my notes to write out ideas for articles and later flesh them out into almost full posts. Because Bear offers me so much more in terms of exporting options I have instantly taken to it.</p>
<h2><strong>Sharing</strong></h2>
<p>Once agin the sharing options of this Notes app are right up there with a serious writing app. It offers the option for exporting the notes you have made in such a wide range of options it might take a while to work out which one you really need.</p>
<p>Powerful exporting options are missing from a number of similar app, with many simply offering rich text exporting and some apps offer none! Where as there isn’t many options you would need that Bear doesn’t support. With a simple swipe left while viewing a note you can share in Text, Markdown, PDF, HTML, Rich Text, DocX and if that wasn’t enough you can even export as an image. No more screenshots of your notes to publish in Instagram and Twitter.</p>
<p>This makes everything from writing stories to documents through to just jotting things down to remember a breeze. I have gotten into the habit of attaching PDF’s into Todoist tasks and also Fantastical appointments, simply because I can with relative ease.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="bear-review-landscape-1-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a95e5a17c2.jpg" alt="Bear review landscape 1 1" width="600" height="298" border="0" /></p>
<h1><strong>Deep Dive</strong></h1>
<p>My habits of late have changed to delve a little deeper into my app reviews. Finding all manor of ways to use apps to their full ability. If you need a hand with what all of these terms mean, I will be writing a guide shortly. Safe to say you will need to <a href="http://www.gr36.com/how-to-get-started-with-workflow/">invest in Workflow as a minimum</a> .</p>
<p>The developers of Bear are taking iOS automation seriously straight from the start. Implementing loads of URL call back options. The format of Bear URL Scheme action are as follows</p>
<pre><code>bear://x-callback-url/[action]?[action parameters]&amp;[x-callback parameters]
</code></pre>
<p>There are far too many things to go into and the extent you can customise quick launches and opening is huge. If you want to go through the full FAQ section and find all the <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/faq/X-callback-url%20Scheme%20documentation/">parameters head over to the Bear website</a> .</p>
<p>Two schemes i have used considerably is the simple /open-note parameter</p>
<pre><code>bear://x-callback-url/open-note
</code></pre>
<p>and also opening a specific tag – in my case my work in progress tag so I can see what needs some work on at any point.</p>
<pre><code>bear://x-callback-url/open-tag?name=article/wip
</code></pre>
<p>These can be customised as much or as little as you require, but it is great to see developers spending so much time building in the requirements of power users like myself.</p>
<h1><strong>Bear Verdict</strong></h1>
<p>When I start reviewing a new iOS app that replaces a first party option I often ask myself if anyone is likely to use it above the stock app. The reality is that _<br /><em><em>most</em></em> users are never going to look for something different. However that is not to say that no improvements can be made.</p>
<p>Bear is above and beyond a notes app, almost to the level that labelling it one is so far off the mark it is stupid. Bear is more along the lines of a writing app, it does more than many available Markdown editors. Being able to export and share things with ease, it would replace my old writing app of choice ByWord very easily.</p>
<p>I have slotted Bear in between my current writing app of choice, Ulysses, and my brain. It gives me the ability to format and position text in a small light weight app before moving them to Ulysses for images and publishing. If you simply want a notes app that syncs to all your devices, then look no further than the stock app. If you are looking for something with as many power features as you can cram into an truly gorgeous looking app, then the small subscription is a no brainer.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember I’ve had a weird draw to organising things. It started with stationary and folders, and in the digital age expanded into spreadsheets and lists. I consider myself an organised person – yet one app has improved this further, <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">Todoist</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not even going to pretend this app isn’t expensive. If you are not a big user of todo lists or you’re not looking for something to improve your productivity then this may not be the app for you.</p>
<p>There is a free trial available though, download the app and sign up, then wait for the offer by email. It usually pops into your inbox after a day or so or <a href="https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327">sign up here for a free account</a>. This will give you a month of premium services, so you can sink your teeth into the app and decide if if outlay is worth it for your use case. With that said I haven’t been using Todoist very long, but have already signed up after a few days of getting my set up sorted!</p>
<p>If you are serious about productivity then the £21.99 per year subscription model won’t be an issue for you. It is a shame you can’t spread the cost monthly like other services, but is works out less than £2 a month really. Premium services include some pretty great features so you won’t be disappointed. For the purpose of the review I will be covering Premium features and these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task Labels &amp; Reminders</li>
<li>Location-based notifications</li>
<li>Add tasks via email</li>
<li>Attach files and comments to tasks</li>
<li>Automatic backups</li>
<li>Productivity tracking and charts</li>
<li>iCal synchronization</li>
<li>Project templates</li>
</ul>
<p>Todoist is completely cross platform with 13 different apps available for various platforms, including a web sign in for everything else. This is a feature lacking from quite a few competing apps, allowing for a log in from any device. You can also collaborate on tasks should work colleagues or friends also use the app, they stand a good chance as Todoist currently has 3 million users.</p>
<h2><strong>Sort Your Tasks</strong></h2>
<p>For many years I have been using iCloud Reminders and Notes perfectly well. This is an excepts app and pretty good solution for most users, but Todoist turbo charges organisation and productivity. More than this it makes everything easy to understand. Breaking all your tasks down into Projects and allowing you to set labels and organise with filters.</p>
<p>Not only is the layout of the app easy to understand, Todoist makes adding tasks a breese. The apps allows for entry of whatever it is you need to get done in natural language in a similar vain as one of my other favourite apps Fantastical. Setting up a task is as easy as inputting the description followed by when you want to do it e.g. “Publish new story tomorrow at 9am”. You can also attach this task to a Project by adding #project name and a Label by adding @label.<br /><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-10-24-Todoist-review-iphones-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c794feac6e.jpg" alt="2017 10 24 Todoist review iphones 1" width="599" height="398" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>Projects</strong></h2>
<p>When opening the app the first things you will come across are Projects. Think of Project as an area in which the task falls into, these really should be called ‘groups’ or some <a href="https://medium.com/by-vernon/this-is-how-i-set-up-todoist-and-actually-gtd-3867e5e887a8#.eg67ygm5b">people refer to these as ‘Buckets’.</a> These took me the longest time to get my head around, the name more than anything threw me off. Splitting tasks isn’t a unique thing for an app to do, however identifiers such as ‘home’, ‘work’ and ‘writing’ makes understanding them easier.</p>
<p>Although you can set up projects however you wish. This could be used on an ad hoc basis for specific projects for project management, or used as I do just for a specific area. The amount of different options really are limitless, you can create sub-projects under main projects to ensure everything is organised and also implement colour coding to make everything easy to see.</p>
<p>Inside the projects you place those pesky tasks that need to be completed. Giving them a description and customising them as much or as little as you like. You can structure sub tasks underneath them, you can leave comments on the task and even attach a range of files with ease. This is amazingly pretty unique for a task manager – most seem to support only pictures or voice recording. Whereas Todoist will allow images, text files, pdfs and many more.</p>
<p>Tasks can also be given a priority, or Flag, dependant on how important they are. This will dictate where they appear in your lists. You can also set this by dragging and dropping tasks into the order you want them, or simply adding some Labels.</p>
<h2><strong>Labels And Filters</strong></h2>
<p>I made the mistake of rushing into Labels and thinking they would work the same as my Ulysses tag Workflow. However I found a bit of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-ways-i-use-todoist-getting-things-done-gtd-brad-bush">inspiration from the internet</a> and created different Labels dependent on time they would take. If I had a spare hour I could just look at that specific tag, meaning tasking could be squeezed into any spare time I had. Productivity x10!</p>
<p>That really helps when you combine Projects and Labels into easy to view Filters. Filters allow you to easily see any task that fits into set criteria. You can set them for anything you wish by using Todoist advanced query system, combining them to make sure you only see what you need.</p>
<p>For example I have set up filters for Writing tasks that are Labeled 10mins, so I can see anything that just needs a proof read. Or another for any tasks that really need to be done today – of cause coloured red and named URGENT!</p>
<p>I have many overlapping filters that can pull anything that needs doing with a specific requirement. What’s more is that if my needs change, the app designers have made it so simple to create or edit filters it takes a few moments. Filters are really what has made tasks easy to see and finish when spare time occurs, rather than picking through iCloud reminders to see if I. Office anything I could do.</p>
<h2><strong>More than you think</strong></h2>
<p>Todoist also fills all the basic requirements, such as the ability to set reminders for tasks that need to be done at a certain date/time. Reminders can also be set for when you reach a certain location, so it’s easy to assign things that need to be done when out and about. Reminders could be set for simple things such as shopping requirements or just tasks you need to do as soon as you get home.</p>
<p>If you miss a date or time, Todoist will even reschedule the task quickly and easily. Either automatically with a suggested best time to fit the task into your day. Or you can set it to another specific date/time with a couple of taps. Don’t worry about those recurring issues either as you can set the same task to come back or a regular basis. So the gym reminder won’t go away that easily if you don’t want it to!</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that the app will sync all your Tasks, Project, Labels etc to all of the device you have. It does this quickly and solidly, with no fall out. I use Todoist on iPhone, iPad and two different Macs with flawless results. I keep bashing iCloud reminders, and in the most part I have had very little issues, but when they did occur tasks wouldn’t sync to other devices or they would just disappear completely.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="2017-10-24-Todoist-review-tick-1.jpeg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/26a9107f7b.jpg" alt="2017 10 24 Todoist review tick 1" width="599" height="388" border="0" />The app also awards you ‘Karma’ for completed tasks. This has been heralded by some as a great incentive to create and complete tasks on time but hasn’t served any purpose for me. However if you like competing with yourself then you might find some motivation from it. For every completed task you are awarded some points, these combine to boost you up the five different levels.</p>
<p>Right now I am sat at 1160 with a Novice label, however I have only been using the app a short while. The karma screen can be found at the top next your name, and does give you some good info about over due and completed tasks. If its annoying you can turn Karma off completely and the space will indicate how many task you have completed instead.</p>
<h2><strong>Deep Dive</strong></h2>
<p>With all of this said, they real beauty I have found in the app is its support for URL call back and <a href="https://ifttt.com/todoist">IFTTT integration</a>. If you’re reading this section I’m pretty sure you already know what these can do for you, however it is nice to see such large development in the area.</p>
<p>Macstories uncovered that Todoist <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/why-i-left-icloud-reminders-for-todoist/">supports several undocumented URL scheme to help automate opening specific areas of the app</a>. To quickly see a weekly over view set up Launch Centre Pro or Workflow to open: <code>todoist://next7days</code></p>
<p>To search for a task<br /><code>todoist://search?query=prompt</code></p>
<p>Or quickly add a task<br /><code>todoist://addtask?content=prompt&amp;date=prompt</code></p>
<p>This is also far from the limit, there is inbuilt support in AirMail to send emails straight to Todoist, which come in handy for tasks that you need to refer back to an email. The app also supports integration into Google calendar and iCloud calendar, so your tasks with a date can been seen in your appointments.</p>
<h2><strong>Todoist Verdict</strong></h2>
<p>With all the features outlined above the options for your set up really are limitless. All of them combine to make Todoist such a delight to use as an everyday tool. The interface is easy to understand and uncomplicated, which is the downfall of similar apps. With not too much work you can designate an area and a time frame to make sure you can cram all your tasks into any amount of time.</p>
<p>The price may be a downfall for some, and it really is a shame they do not offer a monthly subscription option. However with the constant improvements and the ability the app has, if you have the cash consider the investment well worth it.</p>

    <h1 class="p-name">Healthface - An Uncomplicated Apple Watch Complication</h1>
</a>

<p>I held out as long as I could, but I have now caved and bought a Series 2 Apple Watch. Not because it is anything revolutionary, not because I accidentally killed my original version (although I kinda did) but because health and fitness has become so important to me I feel the investment is worth it. I have also found a perfect complication to match my new Nike + version – Healthface.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Apple still have not allowed third party watch faces, yet made a small compromise with adding in custom complications with watchOS 2.0. Some apps have embraced the concept and updated their apps to add in everything from weather to quick links into their apps.</p>
<p>Yet very few apps have really invested in the idea of complications, and developed anything new. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/uk/app/healthface/id1176374647">Healthface by Crunchy Bagel</a> is an excellent and uncomplicated iOS app that displays health data on any accompanying Apple Watch.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="healthface-review-featured-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/38699d91b9.jpg" alt="Healthface review featured 1" width="500" height="293" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong><strong>Complications</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The best part about the whole experience is the ease at which you can display a whole range of metrics right on your Apple Watch. Customise the amount of info displayed and place it on your watch face of choice in both a small or a large complication. Anything that is recorded in the health app can be displayed by Healthface on absolutely any watch face.</p>
<p>I’ve stuck to the boring step count or mindful minutes depending on the watch face I am using at the time. Although you can set anything from vitals, to body measurements or even reproductive health depending on your requirements.</p>
<p>All of the set up is done through the iOS app, by default displaying all of the available watch faces you can choose from. Tapping on a watch face displays the type of complications available. These vary lots dependant on the face, the Mickey Mouse face for example has a Utilitarian small and Utilitarian large available. Where as my weekend watch face, Numerals, only has the Utilitarian small available.</p>
<p>You can then adjust which information you wish to be displayed and also customise how you wish it to be displayed. You can customise the unit of measurement and also any icons displayed in the complication. With a live preview of how the complication will appear at the top of the screen, as seen on the furthest right screen shot above.</p>
<p>Once the design is perfected, then you can place the complication on your watch face using a long press (force touch) and selecting ‘customise’. However because of how watchOS works, this complication will be the same across all watch faces that use that particular complication size. Meaning that unfortunately you cannot have different info displayed on different watch faces if they use the same complication size.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="healthface-review-screenshots-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7c1a56554f.jpg" alt="Healthface review screenshots 1" width="600" height="265" border="0" /><br />Tapping on the complication will open up a screen where the information can be refreshed. You will only need to do this when placing the complication or changing the data displayed. I have found myself pressing the complication by accident a few times, it is a shame this cant be locked somehow. Although this is all by design from Apple, so these types of changes are outside of the developer control.</p>
<p>The real benefit of Healthface is putting your complications to work for you. Saving time digging into the Health app on your phone when you simply want to see a select piece of data you are keeping an eye on. Want to see your steps quickly and easily, no problem. Prefer to see your average heart rate – easy. The options are limitless and it’s great to see a developer using complications to make life easier.</p>
<p>Healthface is available <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/uk/app/healthface/id1176374647">for £0.79 from the app store</a>, if you’re serious about health it should be a must.</p>

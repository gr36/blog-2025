				"content_html": "<p>After the last few years using exclusively Fuji cameras, bar a short test with a Ricoh GRiiix, I am sorry to say I’ve switched back to Sony. There are a few reasons for this, but this is in no way a justification or a reason why I think they suck, merely my thoughts on the subject as a few people have asked. This won’t be a very elegant post, just a few points I feel are worth raising.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/uploads/2025/dscf1412.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"auto-focus\">Auto Focus</h2>\n<p>“Why don’t you just manual focus like a <strong>real</strong> photographer?” I hear them shout back to my pathetic moaning. The truth is, when I got my first Fuji camera after selling all my Sony gear about 4 years ago, I thought the autofocus sucked. It didn’t. Granted, it wasn’t as good as I was used to with my Sony A7iii, but after a bit of experimentation I got used to its quirks and found it pretty reliable for the types of photography I wanted to do.</p>\n<p>Since getting the XT5 I felt a decline in performance from the autofocus, particularly AFC, which affected my enjoyment. In street photography there can be fleeting moments and I missed quite a few of them because of poor or slow autofocus. Recent firmware updates have promised to fix this but have indeed made it worse! This came to a head around a month ago when camped out waiting for a shot I had lined up. After more than 45 minutes of waiting for subjects, the autofocus kept letting me down.</p>\n<p>It was as they call it, the straw that broke the camel’s back.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/uploads/2025/dscf1040.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"build-quality\">Build Quality</h2>\n<p>There has also been a significant decline in build quality. My trusty XT3 felt like a masterpiece and was a delight to use. As was my X100V. Solid, reliable and nice to use. Whereas the XT5 had creaky doors covering the ports and seemed to be made for the scratchiest plastic they could find.</p>\n<p>It never let me down in the short time I had it, but it didn’t fill me full of confidence, and I know others have had problems with cracking, whether sealing and other minor issues. Fujifilm seems <a href=\"https://fujixweekly.com/2024/07/08/is-fujifilm-purposefully-causing-shortages-to-manipulate-the-market/\">more concerned with purposely restricting manufacturing</a> than actually making good cameras.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/uploads/2025/9aea494b-e857-4a40-baac-a68820a5a3eb.jpg\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A person walks through a dimly lit tunnel with illuminated artwork on the walls.\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"i-miss-the-joy\">I Miss The Joy</h2>\n<p>There are things I will miss from Fuji Cameras, particularly how enjoyable they are to use with top dials for settings, but they lost the joy I had when first using them due to the above issues. I don’t make any money from my photography, and these frustrations got in my way of having a good time when out and about.</p>\n<p>Sony cameras often feel too sterile and boring. Perfect for a pro workhorse but missing something special. However, the A7CR that I picked up, with a 50 mm prime, feels at least a little like a Leica and has brought me back at least some enjoyment.</p>\n",

I have very little self-control when it comes to dopamine boosting things, and my phone is the worst.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/uploads/2024/f0bf8417-c6a0-4019-a749-6de61691daa0.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I realise how pathetic that is. Over the years, I’ve given advice which is regurgitated from that which I receive (often unrequested) multiple times. To simply stop. Much like an addict l, because that is what I am of sorts, I’ve tried too hard too quickly and slowly returned to ‘normal’.</p>\n<p>This is a personality weakness that unfortunately I just can’t overcome. Hence, why I need to babysit myself and treat myself like an idiot. A title that I well deserve because I can’t put the shinny thing with bright flashing colours down and live in the world.</p>\n<p>So in steps Screen Time. Yes, that truly pathetic attempt and virtue signalling that Apple introduced with iOS12 six years ago. It’s slow, it uses <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/gcrrsy/comment/fpefy1y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\">unnecessary battery life at times</a>, and it’s easy to get around. Let me tell you though — it works.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/uploads/2024/sunday-01-dec-2024-20-04-24.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Typically, the criticism with Screen Time is that it is too easy to bypass. That instead Apple should have built some kind of phone jail to keep people like me out in times of weakness. Instead, I think it strikes the right balance. By putting a simple screen in between me taping the icon and opening the app ensures I think about if I do want to open the app. Something the <a href=\"https://www.opal.so/pricing\">popular Opal app</a> charges a fortune for.</p>\n<p>It puts just enough friction between me and something that won’t benefit my future self, and still being able to use the app if I need to. I have set downtime for the times I want to switch off and also limits to some apps for each day. Babysitting myself works really well, because my monkey mind just can’t stay away.</p>\n",

However, once the novelty wore off, I quickly returned to using my Pro Max iPhone because it accomplished most of the tasks I used the iPad Mini for, eliminating the need for an additional device. If I could hazard a guess, I think that’s where the mini version falls for most people.</p>\n<p>It gives you something bigger and lighter than a phone for media consumption, yet isn’t big enough to get bogged down in all the things you might expect a regular tablet to do for you. Stuck in a strange purgatory that is both useful and not quite useful enough at the same time. With the solution usually being “I’ll just use my phone”.</p>\n<p>On picking up the display device from its stand, I immediately remembered why it holds this special place. A really nice device that offers a lot but fails to deliver a large enough use case, but — as Federico expertly put above — perhaps that’s the point?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/uploads/2024/4a3dafd1-de76-4d52-af78-cb5c131fb5f9.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-away-from-it-all\">Getting Away From It All</h2>\n<p>I am constantly fed up with my work life bleeding into everything else I do. I’ve written about it <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/18/all-work-and.html\">affecting my enjoyment of using my MacBook</a> outside of work, and the same thing happens with my phone. It’s littered with Teams and email apps that allow me to do things on the go, but also act to pull me back in out of work hours.</p>\n<p>Same too with <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/08/01/the-ipad-life.html\">my iPad Pro</a>. It is predominantly a work device. One used to draw and design, so it’s out of the question to begin to read and write on it in my spare time. There’s just too many things to distract me away, and we all know I lack the self-control to avoid them!</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, it’s absolutely crazy for me to spend £500 on an iPad to use for such small tasks as would to create a ’third place’ but I entirely understand the logic. For many people, this place is gaming, but mine is my Boox Palma. A device I am often equally ridiculed for buying as I would be with an iPad Mini. However, it gives me a place to catch up with the waiting queue of RSS feeds and my favourite thing of all to do, read books.</p>\n<p>Any third place you choose is one of happiness and contentment, no work allowed!</p>\n",

Switching the mute switch for an Action Button seemed like a genius move, as I just put my device on silent anyway and never take it out. Now I had something useful to help me do things on my phone — oh how wrong I was!</p>\n<p>Let’s start by prefacing this with the fact that I know some people find the action button really useful. I have seen some people have wonderful setups and took to it straight away. I’ve even seen people use it, normal people, out in the wild! So I am well aware that your usage may vary, but please bear in mind this is my blog, so this is about me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/uploads/2024/apple-iphone-15-pro-lineup-action-button.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I <em>was</em> convinced, though. That&rsquo;s not some kind of rise to keep you reading. Yet here I am a day from the next iPhone announcement, possibly with <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-camera-button-as-creators-shift-to-horizontal-videos\">yet more buttons</a>, having hardly ever used the action one. There doesn’t seem to be many reasons for this outside of muscle memory and forgetting it’s there, but I’ve heard similar stories from other people, too. The lack of use boils down to a general opinion that it is in the wrong place and needs to have more use cases.</p>\n<p>I’d like to use it more. I have tried, but ultimately, I simply forget it is there. Perhaps if it was on the right-hand side as many people suggest, it might have reminded me a little more. My brain associates the upper-left side as the barren land of the silent switch that served me not other purpose than a fidget toy. I use my phone left-handed and turn it left when taking photos, so even using it as a camera button is uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>This revolution seems to be something users are excited to see on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/\">regular iPhone 16 models</a>, so let&rsquo;s see if adoption improves. However, I am of the mind that it will just lead to even more people forgetting it is there and being dropped in a few generations.</p>\n",

This was the biggest reason we got my son an iPhone last year, upgrading from a cheep Android phone which was his first device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"macbook-pro\">MacBook Pro</h2>\n<p>Let me be completely frank, there is absolutely no way I would give up working on a Mac. I’ve done it for years now, I have all my workflows down, and Apple would have to stop making computers entirely for me to give it up.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4c963ab600.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I have nothing bad to say about Windows, I haven’t used it bar Remote Desktop since Windows 8, but my preference for macOS runs much deeper and there is zero need for me to switch. This doesn’t stop me using a non Apple phone though, apart from a slightly worse workflow for transferring files, working with clearer shots and sending messages from my desktop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"non-issues\">Non Issues</h2>\n<p>The usual thing people point to with switching is iMessage. Which is completely non issue for me, I would simply use WhatsApp. I like being able to send messages from my desktop, but it’s not a dealbreaker.</p>\n<p>I am also completely ok with not have an iPhone in a hardware sense. When I first switched it was for a vastly superior camera and there are now numerous Android handsets that have a shooter of at least compatible quality (if not better).</p>\n<p>There are only two apps that I use that are not cross-platform. Ulysses, which I tend to use more on my iPad and Mac, and Matter. Neither of which are dealbreakers for switching. Couple with the fact I don’t actually take many photos on my phone anymore, means that both of these are a non issue for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"im-still-here\">I’m still here</h2>\n<p>If it was cost-effective to try out a full package of Android devices (phone, watch, and accessories) I’d be up for trying it out — but they don’t exist. The <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/08/16/had-some-handson.html\">Pixel launch offer with heavy discounts</a> on accompanying watch and buds is the closest I have come, but I’d still have to sell up to try it, and this is here I think most people fall down.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s too expensive and too much of a learning curve to give up all of these things. The risk doesn’t seem to match the reward anymore, so I’m stuck. There’s nothing wrong with this but something to be aware of.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I wrote this note on my phone when first considering <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/08/24/ive-conceded-to.html\">buying a Boox Palma</a>. I wasn’t convinced that replacing my social media action with reading was necessarily the best option, but in the sort term, I can&rsquo;t see any other way. Like a smoker that needs to find something to do with their hands, I to need to find something to occupy myself instead of doom-scrolling. So I jumped in, but this question still exists.</p>\n<p>Of course, I did my research before buying. Read loads of articles and watched far too many YouTube videos on the Book Palma. Luckily, this is the new hotness and content isn’t difficult to find — just this week members of The Verge team were talking about it on <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24232158/telegram-pavel-durov-arrest-yelp-google-vergecast\">The Vergecast</a> and MKBHD <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xwTub7_we0w?si=Vy_xTVl2n-DKX0FY\">made a video</a> on it. The Boox Palma is a device I have been eyeing for a while since friend of the blog Kevin Wammer <a href=\"https://cliophate.wtf/posts/boox-palma-review\">posted about his</a>, and Craigmod <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@craigmod/post/C36xcJCSK8U\">began gushing</a>. This sounds like some kind of weird justification for purchasing such a weird device, and in some ways it is — but I wanted it before it was cool, OK!</p>\n<p>Due to this research, YouTube thinks I am some kind of e-Ink obsessive, which is annoying, but at times interesting. Devices like the Hisense A9 and the BigMe HiBreak infiltrated my feed. Think Boox Palma, but with worse software and a SIM card slot. Reviews are mixed on all of these pink phones, but they all feature b-roll of someone reading on their phone with activities going in the background. This was sold as something great, it’s a Kindle in your pocket everywhere you go, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I am missing the point.</p>\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/20240830-dscf2854.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<p>Granted, reading won’t be working to distract me as much as social media is. It won&rsquo;t be hacking my brain to ruin my attention span and possibly, my mental health. So it’s better. Reading is one of my favourite things to do, but if I will be reading instead of being present in the world, that can&rsquo;t be as good as I think it is. Can it? Given the choice, wouldn’t it be better to simply learn to be bored a bit more?</p>\n<p>I’d like to say I have some evidence to back this up. However, my attempts to see if I am replacing one distraction with another remain unanswered. There is <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-happened-when-you-replaced-social-media-with-reading-books\">some subjective information</a> out there that <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-that-reading-books-seems-like-a-better-option-than-social-media-and-watching-videos\">reading is much better</a>, but much of this is removal of doom-scrolling, not the activity itself. Adding my own personal take, one that is much too early to hold much weight, I would agree that having a device like this instead of my phone is nearly all benefit.</p>\n<p>I say nearly because it takes some understanding of its limits to mould it to your use. I took some time to think about how I wanted to limit the ability of my Boox Palma before buying, and several conversations with Kevin. However, that hard work at the start has led to reading more, visiting social media less and general feeling much more balanced. Long may it continue.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Perhaps not all of us, but for many people who are interested in tech, and particularly bloggers, the allure of being able to use a tablet to get things done is a strong one. I’ve been there, realised that I can’t make it do what I want, yet always have one hanging around. Here I am, once again, writing on an iPad Pro—and these words are nothing more than to justify my expenditure!</p>\n<p>There was only a minimal time I didn’t have an iPad at all. Despite it leaving <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html\">quite dramatically</a>, soon returning in the form of a 2018 iPad Pro that I had until recently. It was often <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/18/all-work-and.html\">my creative computer</a>, but one that came in and out of my life whilst <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/26/the-quiet-and.html\">expecting nothing in return</a>. I’ve bought and sold ‘better’ iPads alongside this one, but expected too much from them. Whereas my 2018 version was worth more to me than anyone else, and suck around when all others failed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/uploads/2024/leon-seibert-ljypkpebt4i-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it finally <a href=\"https://gregmorris.photo/2024/07/24/need-to-upgrade.html\">gave up the ghost</a>, so I began looking around for a replacement. To be honest, I wanted another 2018 version but, whilst being very cheap, they run the risk of dying the same as my old one. I should have taken Mere Civilian’s <a href=\"https://merecivilian.com/why-did-i-buy-the-m2-ipad-pro-instead-of-the-m4/\">advice</a> and picked up a M2 version, but there was something about the new M4’s that appealed to me. Not because of the power, but because of the nice screen and slimmed down weight.</p>\n<p>So, I am sitting here, typing this out on an 11” m4, with an Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard. I got it very lightly used, after trying a 13” version first that didn’t fit my workflow, and traded in numerous bits of tech that were no longer needed. There are trade off here. The keyboard is a little too small, the size isn’t as good for drawing as the larger version, but it fits better into my life being more portable.</p>\n<p>I don’t for one second think that many people should buy these new iPads unless you get a good deal. They are expensive and are in many ways complete overkill, but I’m enjoying having an iPad back in my life after even just a few weeks away.</p>\n",

After reading part of the excellent book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wNRuxK\">Find Your Frame by Craig Whitehead</a>, I felt inspired. When I woke up and saw the sun shining early in the morning, I decided to go out instead. Lately, the weather has been terrible here for May and June, but the forecast looked good.</p>\n<p>I chose a familiar place since I am heading to London this week, so Nottingham streets are my favorite. During this visit, I tried to shoot much slower than I normally would. I found a shot and waited for the right moment to capture it. Some of the photos I took in my short couple of hours I really like.</p>\n<p>In Find Your Frame, Craig encourages you to discover what you want to shoot and experiment with different styles. I can&rsquo;t stay away from light and shadows, though.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/a71199a9-9121-4a0b-aa28-4acd4bb266bf.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A person is walking on a shaded sidewalk, pulling a rolling suitcase.\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/85002993-0d8d-41f9-b64f-b1610ba91db8.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A person wearing a yellow and black striped skirt is walking through a dimly lit area with sunlight streaming in through windows.\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/2e19d557-b01d-4f20-96cd-57098b9ec9be.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A person is seated on a bench in front of a building, silhouetted against a window with shadows from nearby trees.\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/8d8936b7-3d7e-4304-ba39-a04756edef34.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A person walks through a dimly lit space with a handbag, illuminated by a slanting beam of light across the floor.\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/c53578be-9329-4d84-931b-cac8800d27b4.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A person wearing a reflective orange vest is pushing a cart in a dimly lit environment.\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/98643ed4-479f-429f-99da-b737b5e5cb9b.jpg\" width=\"1201\" height=\"1800\" alt=\"A person in a green jacket with a white hood and a black hat sits alone on concrete steps against a clear blue sky.

You don&rsquo;t do that by locking your card to your own wallet, you do it by making it an easy choice for consumers to pick you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Of course, Matt is correct. If anyone knows about payment matters, it&rsquo;s Matt. However, I think this is only part of the story. My Apple Wallet contains more than payment cards, and I foresee this becoming an issue when (rather than if) the EU forces Apple to open things up.</p>\n<p>Currently, my Apple Wallet holds a variety of items that I can access with a tap: a few loyalty cards, my Arsenal Football tickets (they are by far the greatest team the world has ever seen), and also train tickets for my upcoming trip to London. There&rsquo;s no hassle with different apps, printing things out, or searching through emails to find what I need; it&rsquo;s all there, ready for me. This utility, I envision, will be decimated the moment everyone can produce a &lsquo;wallet&rsquo; for my iPhone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c272249f05.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Suddenly, I&rsquo;ll need an LNER wallet to access my train tickets, a separate app for all my loyalty cards, and my Arsenal tickets will return to the app from which they came. The simple reason is that everyone wants you in their app. As Matt pointed out in his post, their &lsquo;wallet&rsquo; becomes a &lsquo;halo&rsquo; product. Not one that directly generates income, although it could, but one that markets to you every time you open the app to retrieve your tickets or cards. We know this because you only have to look at Android as an example.</p>\n<p>Every time I want to test a new Samsung phone, I endure the same frustrating experience. My bank, Barclays, doesn&rsquo;t support Samsung Pay. They were one of the last to add Apple Pay, and for a long time didn&rsquo;t support anything else. They tried instead to push their own payment app on Android users with a terrible experience. The great thing about Android is that I can download Google Pay and use that instead, but it doesn&rsquo;t work as seamlessly as the default app. Samsung also works very hard not to tell me I can use another payment app, and as a result, most users go without.</p>\n<p>This is because Samsung doesn&rsquo;t want to inform users they can switch. They want to be able to sell you things in the wallet app: a new phone, perhaps a card that will work with Samsung Pay, or some accessories. By getting users into your app, you can generate revenue, and that&rsquo;s important to all parties involved in the process. I think it&rsquo;s true that most retailers won&rsquo;t care, but many service providers will; they will want to cut out the 0.15% that Apple receives, and also sell you all their other wares while they&rsquo;re at it.</p>\n",

As the list grows, so does my anxiety about trying to reach the end—an end that is never in sight, let alone becoming any closer. At this point, I try to remind myself of a mantra picked up from Oliver Burkeman: &ldquo;<a href=\"/2023/01/30/there-will-always.html\">There will always be more work</a>,&rdquo; but it still gets a bit much sometimes.</p>\n<p>You see, most of these books on productivity come from places of privilege. They are authored by people who either control their task lists or, quite often, occupy positions where they are no longer burdened by one. The problem is that most of us, the mere mortals who consume these books, do not sit in this graceful position. We often do not control our never-ending task list and must forever contemplate the idea of getting &rsquo;too much done&rsquo; for fear of being given more.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2716364e52.jpg\" alt=\"an image generated by Ai of a man sat with head in hands surrounded by things to do and a ticking clock\"></p>\n<p>There are a few golden books out there. Earlier this year, I read <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Make_Time/eaFHDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\">Make Time</a>, which came from a more understanding place. The two authors, although afflicted with the tendency to talk about themselves too much, wrote the book from a more realistic position in working life. I am sure there are more out there too, but the books, podcasts, and YouTube videos all talk about very simple things: scheduling your work (in a myriad of different ways) and being dedicated to completing it.</p>\n<p>You can time block. You could plan ahead. Mark one task as <a href=\"/2023/01/24/thinking-about-important.html\">your priority</a>. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter. What none of them talk about, save for &ldquo;4000 Weeks&rdquo;, is the stress of it all. Looking at your task list and never seeing it get shorter is one of the best motivation killers imaginable. Having no breaks in your workload to think, plan, be creative, or complete a task you find more fulfilling is a passion killer—a surefire way to burn out and throw in the towel.</p>\n<p>As I said at the start, there will always be more work, and that&rsquo;s a good thing to keep moving and stay motivated. However, there comes a point when it becomes too much, the plate is piled too high, and there is no room to breathe. Drowning in tasks is a terrible way to go.</p>\n",

Today&rsquo;s task, alongside <a href=\"https://social.lol/@gr36/111988050307279780\">sorting out the navigation</a>  to display better, was adding some content to my <a href=\"/tags/posts/\">Posts page</a>. On my old blog, this page listed all the tags I have and a few examples of the posts found in them, so I set about doing exactly that.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/fe58829c7a.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of my blog displaying the first 5 posts in my reviews collection\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"add-a-filter\">Add A Filter</h2>\n<p>After attempting to write my own code to pull out the latest five posts from a specific tag, I stumbled across <a href=\"https://mxb.dev/\">Max Böck</a> Github repo with an example of <a href=\"https://github.com/maxboeck/eleventy-webmentions\">how to display webmentions</a>. This filter allowed passing a collection to it and also customizing the number of posts to display. The filter is as follows:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>// Get the first n elements of a collection.\n  eleventyConfig.addFilter(&#39;head&#39;, (array, n) =&gt; {\n    if (n &lt; 0) {\n      return array.slice(n)\n    }\n\n    return array.slice(0, n)\n  })\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"displaying-on-page\">Displaying On Page</h2>\n<p>This made my job much easier, and the filter could potentially be reusable in other situations. For the time being, I chose to display the three most-used tags until I can clean up my imported posts from my old blog and integrate others than using for. As an example, to show the first 5 posts in my Reviews Collection, I use <code>{% raw %}{% for post in collections.Review | head(-5) %}{% endraw %}</code>.</p>\n<p>I use <code>head(-5)</code> in the filter to get the latest 5 posts, whereas <code>head(5)</code> would get the first 5 from the collection, i.e., the oldest posts. Once I have cleaned up my posts, I plan to display all collections here and make the code cleaner rather than repeating it three times. But as a stopgap while I do this, I am pretty happy with how it turned out.</p>\n",

It was important to me that it cycle through as many as possible, but it was not browser-intensive, and my blog continued to serve static pages.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">eleventyConfig</span>.<span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">addFilter</span>(<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;randomItem&#34;</span>, (<span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">arr</span>) =&gt; {\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">arr</span>.<span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">sort</span>(() =&gt; {\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>      <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">return</span> <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">0.5</span> <span style=\"color:#f92672\">-</span> Math.<span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">random</span>();\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    });\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">return</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">arr</span>.<span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">slice</span>(<span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">0</span>, <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">1</span>);\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>  });\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">return</span> {\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>      <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">dir</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">:</span> {\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>        <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">input</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;src&#34;</span>,\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>        <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">output</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">:</span> <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;public&#34;</span>,\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>      },\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    };\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then I can show them wherever I wish using <code>{% raw %}{% for blog in blogroll | randomItem %}{% endraw %}</code>.

A large part of this was webmentions, and thanks to a few <a href=\"https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/\">excellent</a> <a href=\"https://equk.co.uk/2023/07/18/adding-webmentions-in-eleventy/\">guides</a> I got 90% of the the way their.

This is just the way I did it, and if you’ve got some advice I am all ears.</p>\n<h2 id=\"webmentions\">Webmentions</h2>\n<p>I had already implemented a script to pull these from webmention.io and cache these into a local file.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>  // Import required modules\n  const fetch = require(&#39;node-fetch&#39;);\n  const fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\n  const path = require(&#39;path&#39;);\n  require(&#39;dotenv&#39;).config();\n\n  // Constants\n  const CACHE_DIR = &#39;./_cache&#39;;\n  const API_ORIGIN = &#39;https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2&#39;;\n  const TOKEN = process.env.WEBMENTION_IO_TOKEN;\n\n  // Ensure cache directory exists\n  if (!fs.existsSync(CACHE_DIR)) {\n      fs.mkdirSync(CACHE_DIR);\n  }\n\n  // Function to fetch data from the API\n  async function fetchData() {\n      try {\n          const response = await fetch(`${API_ORIGIN}?token=${TOKEN}`);\n          if (!response.ok) {\n              throw new Error(`Failed to fetch data: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`);\n          }\n          const data = await response.json();\n          return data;\n      } catch (error) {\n          console.error(&#39;Error fetching data:&#39;, error.message);\n          throw error;\n      }\n  }\n\n  // Function to save data to JSON file\n  function saveDataToFile(data) {\n      try {\n          const filePath = path.join(CACHE_DIR, &#39;webmentions.json&#39;);\n          fs.writeFileSync(filePath, JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));\n          console.log(&#39;Data saved to:&#39;, filePath);\n      } catch (error) {\n          console.error(&#39;Error saving data to file:&#39;, error.message);\n          throw error;\n      }\n  }\n\n  // Main function to fetch data and save it to file\n  async function main() {\n      try {\n          const data = await fetchData();\n          saveDataToFile(data);\n      } catch (error) {\n          console.error(&#39;An error occurred:&#39;, error.message);\n          process.exit(1);\n      }\n  }\n\n  // Run main function\n  main();\n</code></pre><p>Instead of loading all of the information from this as most guides do, I decided instead to simply count the important details.

				"content_html": "<p>Last month, I wrote a post that never got published. It was written out, formatted, edited and ready to go. As far as I could take it, but I hovered over the publish button and decided against it. There was nothing controversial there, but it criticised a poor take from someone who is well liked, and I couldn’t do doing with the hassle of replies.</p>\n<p>In many respects, the unpublished post in question did its job. Much like the others that I get halfway through and never finish. It got the thoughts out and on to ‘paper’ instead of swirling in my head. The self-censorship didn’t lose me anything, and perhaps gained me a lot of peace, but I still find it funny that I couldn’t publish it on my blog. A space that is reserved for me to reflect on the things I want to write about.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6d3290fb62.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I repeat, there was nothing offensive in the post, simply a retort to the terrible take. The issue that I foresaw was who it was towards. If you offend the community in question, then tend to swarm and reply in droves. All putting in their opinion, even when not asked, which is great, up to a point. I felt as if I wanted to publish it without seeing it anywhere else, perhaps if it were kept away from the blog&rsquo;s main feed it could still live — but that defeats the point.</p>\n<p>As such, it just sat there, doing nothing and annoying me, so I deleted it today and this post is my cathartic release instead. In both deleting the post and publishing this one, I have balanced my blogging chi, but there is still some weirdness there for me. I think that perhaps social media makes it too easy to reply, and too easy for me to read them.</p>\n<p>If the reply took effort to reach out to me personally, or write their own blog post, this may put off even the most motivated of people. Even then, it would be very unlikely that I would see it without visiting their blog directly. I have had these <a href=\"/2020/04/16/one-week-with.html\">protracted discussions before with fellow bloggers</a> through link posts, and they generally go down much better than those thrown at me in 280 characters.</p>\n",

But it comes with the trade-off that, usually, the thing becomes a little less fun.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It doesn’t matter what you like doing, the moment you get reasonably good at it someone will say “I bet you could make some money doing that”. Should you choose to, it is at that point the fun will be sucked out of it.</p>\n<p>Perhaps not straight away. It might take a few weeks or months. Perhaps longer. At some point, whilst trying to streamline it or maximise profits, you will realise you don’t enjoy doing this thing any more. You will realise that not everything needs to be monetised, and you will miss the old days of doing it for fun.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d64784cf27.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Like a sponge, if given free rein, our actions will suck all the fun out of everything. Ali quotes a ‘game designer’ from a video he has watched. What video and what game designer we don’t know, he said, “Left unchecked, players will optimise the fun out of the game they’re playing”.</p>\n<p>Which, as Ali says, is an interesting quote (just not quite enough to write down who said it) because it cuts right to the heart of our unhealthy trait to ruin everything we enjoy by doing too much of it. My tendency, as Ali has found out, is to do this with podcasts. Start spending too much time on audio editing, recording too much, and lose sight of what really matters — the conversation.</p>\n<p>I also say this fairly often about writing because I have seen it happen to friends of mine that now need to pay the bills by publishing. All the writing they did because they enjoyed it and moulded their craft, grinds to a holt. I guess, who on earth wants to do things for free, when they can get paid for it. Well, we all should.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Straight off the bat, I understand I’ve made these types of statements before. Following the iPhone 14 launch, I had &rsquo;no interest&rsquo; in purchasing anything, and a few weeks later, I had a 14 Pro Max and an <a href=\"/2022/11/18/apple-watch-ultra.html\">Apple Watch Ultra</a>. However, with that said, I have absolutely no interest in the Vision Pro, so I have stayed quiet about it. That is to say, this whole post is coming from this standpoint.</p>\n<p>Due to this apathy, I’ve been reasonably sheltered from the gushing by others online. I’ve got the words muted on Mastodon, and it has kept most talk out of my feed. However, while laughing along to Andy’s recent <a href=\"https://scribbles.page/andy/posts/if-vr-is-the-future-i-m-screwed-hn5yp_rx\">face hugger post</a>, I began to type some thoughts into my notes app, and it turned into something publishable. Spoiler alert: they haven’t really changed from my <a href=\"/2023/06/15/apples-vision-of.html\" class=\"u-in-reply-to\">gut feelings</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/54fdafb087.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>That’s not to say I don’t see the use case. I understand the appeal of such a device, to be engrossed in something so much that the outside world is cut off. The feeling of immersion in something is a remarkable experience. The desire to be fully immersed in a film or computer game is understandable – I am just not convinced it is worth the downsides.</p>\n<p>I enjoy nothing more than sitting in my office, noise-cancelling headphones on, <a href=\"/2021/12/18/brain-fm-the.html\">playing brain.fm</a>, and being engrossed in deep work. Perhaps going to the cinema and sitting in front of a gigantic screen with surround sound. In neither of these situations have I thought, &lsquo;This would be better if I could put this screen on my face.&rsquo; For me, at least, any VR headset, even a £3,500 one with creepy eyes on the front, doesn’t solve problems I encounter.</p>\n<p>Recently, I think Apple has also realised this and switched the marketing. From being all-in on the Vision Pro solving working and media consumption problems, they have switched the messaging to emotion. Many of those lucky enough to try one have a strangely unified emotional response to <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/i-saw-my-iphone-spatial-movies-in-apple-vision-pro/\">spatial video</a>. With one such reporter being <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/tech/apple-vision-pro-photos-app-spatial-video-hands-on\">brought to the brink of tears</a>.</p>\n<p>Who am I to argue with someones feelings, but outside of this, the utility of this expensive purchase is extremely limited. Perhaps that&rsquo;s the point. The Vision Pro is for those with money to spend on something with limited use. The technology will no doubt get cheaper and become easier to purchase, but from my anecdotal experience, there are already plenty of people with cheap Meta devices gathering dust.</p>\n<p>Apple may well have developed technology to <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/03/reduce-eyestrain-and-motion-sickness/\">try to combat motion sickness</a>, but there’s no getting around the sickness from spending £3500 only to realise you need to create problems for it to solve.</p>\n",

I was trying to explain how others should manage projects efficiently, ensuring they are clear on the desired outcomes and can measure them once the project is completed. Granted, this might be a bit out there, but it could help others.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/faa8379f30.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Having a project is like following a recipe.</p>\n<p>You find one you like; it might be something you stumble upon, or you might already have an idea of what you want to eat. Then, you create the recipe to achieve the desired result. In both instances, a good result is clear, and you know exactly what you aim to achieve from it.</p>\n<p>The departments you need to pull into your project are like the tools you are going to use. You chop onions with the correct knife; you don&rsquo;t give control over to the knife, you just use it to achieve the vision you have. You pull in your design team, use them to create the vision you have, while listening to their feedback and advice. They are the experts.</p>\n<p>Then, you go through the recipe step by step, using all the tools at your disposal, and complete your project. You measure the results, both at the end and during the project. You might discover that you need a few more tomatoes or to chop the onions differently. So, next time when you want to replicate the same project or something similar, you can look at the results from last time and make the required changes.</p>\n<p>You work slowly towards being able to pull together the best project you can achieve. You bring together all the parts, using all the tools you have to the best of your ability. Some might be automated; many might require following instructions, but in the end, you have something you followed through and can be proud of.</p>\n<p>Now I’m hungry.</p>\n",

It was a fascinating talk, more so listening after all the drama, I found particularly interesting his thoughts on the co-evolution of Ai. He comes across with well-balanced thoughts on the creation of such a societal shifting product as AI. In many ways, it reflects the evolution needed of all such products. They need to evolve alongside the community they are impacting to make the most change.</p>\n<p>In the case of Ai, he highlighted the held beliefs that it should be worked on in private and then one day AGI launched to the world. Which clearly would be too much of a change too quickly. Instead, OpenAi chose to develop its products in the open and see what people thought and did with it. Which is a far better prospect than releasing a world shifting invention such as Ai overnight.</p>\n<p>Society as a whole, or a large percentage of those exposed to, as with Google Glass, can, of course, reject things entirely. They can make clear that they don’t want this kind of product. That doesn’t make it a bad product, just too much change too quickly, or little perceived benefit. Which is why Sam was talking about the importance of these intellectual pieces of technology evolving in public.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c8b9bb2c6b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Jack Goody and Daniel Bell coined the term intellectual technologies. They were both sociologists, referring to anything that could be used to improve our mental abilities — anything from an abacus, to a clock or a thermometer. Nicholas Car referred to the web as a new form of intellectual technology in his book <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781838952587\">The Shallows</a>, one that is changing our brain both figuratively and actually. It is a new way of interfacing with the world around us, and so too are the <a href=\"/2023/11/18/the-search-for.html\">new interaction methods</a> for Ai.</p>\n<p>The pros and cons of developing Ai aside, all of these advancements bring with them a new way of thinking and extending our cognitive abilities. The slow, steady walk towards AI being able to perform complex tasks is inevitable, however at least we have a chance to see how and where it fits into our lives. There will be upheaval, but by co-developing Ai with society as a whole, we at least have more time and space to work out where it will affect society most and cater to those effects.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>This year was the second year I set myself a goal. One that was born out of a frustration that my attention being stolen from me and my concern that I needed to get it back. 2022 my goal was to watch more movies. Like most New Year’s resolutions, it failed miserably in the first few weeks. Whereas reading, that’s my thing!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/88c6fd84a3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"making-goals\">Making Goals</h2>\n<p>Setting a goal always seems a bit strange to me. I followed in the footsteps of Matt Birchler for movies, and was encouraged by micro.blog to set one for reading. The trouble was I had no idea what to set it at. I <em>had</em> been using the excellent <a href=\"https://epilogue.micro.blog/\">Epilogue app</a> for a while, but not long enough to track a whole year.</p>\n<p>I honestly had no idea how many books I <em>could</em> read in a year, and even setting a goal based on books read seemed strange. Some books are easy to polish off in a day or so, whereas some I have read required a long slog of considerable effort. I thought about hours of reading, but that seemed like a chore. I could think about <a href=\"https://tiramisu.bearblog.dev/2023-books/\">counting pages turned,</a> I guess, but that’s more work than I want to put in. So books read is a happy medium.</p>\n<p>I settled on 30. It was a bit finger in the air, sitting a long way below the extreme levels I have seen online, and also felt achievable. 30 books was a little over 2 a month and with a long backlog of purchases I felt confident.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-result\">The Result</h2>\n<p>That realistic goal setting turned out to be the perfect motivation. Once I had worked my way through the books I had waiting, there was a considerable lag in the middle of the year. However, with confidence in my heart and the positive results I was experiencing, the motivation to read even a few pages a day really helped.</p>\n<p>I finished the year completing 38 books. There were a few re-reads in there, but they all make up a fairly eclectic bunch that I have mostly enjoyed. Check them all out below.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\" style=\"margin:20px 0px; border: 1px solid var(--main-color); border-radius: 11px;\">\n<h2>Books Read in 2023</h2></a>\n</div>\n<p>More than the small feeling of satisfaction having met a goal set 12 months ago, is the difference it has made to my mind. I feel like I have made a small win in the fight for my attention. Taken back, something that I felt I was losing control of, and learnt plenty of lessons along the way. I love reading <a href=\"/2023/12/14/the-joy-of.html\">now more than ever</a>, and I owe a thank you to the micro.blog community that pushed me there.</p>\n",

				"title": "How I Use The New Apple Journal App",
				"content_html": "<p>Finally launching with iOS 17.2 <a href=\"/2023/10/27/new-journalling-app.html\">Apple’s new journal app</a> immediately received criticism. Whilst some of it was valid, most of this focused on features Apple did not promise. It delivered a very barebones app that gives me the impression it was for nothing more than showing off the new <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/tech-talks/111384/\">Journaling API</a>. <em>My</em> thoughts are a lot more positive, and I thought I would run through how I use it.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2024/c4468f7f07.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>I have been journalling on and off for a while, but only really got <a href=\"/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html\">serious in January</a> 2023. Adopting Day One to type out morning pages and other entries pretty religiously. Due to my short relationship to journalling apps, some may claim this restricts the validity of my opinions. I’m not on a <a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com/blog/streak-story-bryce-evans/\">two thousand day streak</a> or anything, but I will leave the level of authority I write with up to you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"powerfullysimple\">Powerfully Simple</h2>\n<p>The reality is, the iOS Journal app is absolutely fine. It’s not as complex as some on the market, but I think that is the biggest positive. As much as I like using Day One, Apples app is actually a much better option for most people. It removes all the things that power users <em>may</em> need, like tagging and multiple journals, but replaces it with a much simpler experience.</p>\n<p>In many ways, it reflects Apple’s user interface design perfectly. Removing as much complexity as possible to “tap thing, do action”. There are some great prompts and selections to fuel the content of your entires, from the aforementioned API, but all you need to do is tap the plus sign and start writing.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2024/45f716c7ff.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>This wonderfully simple interface makes me want to save more things. Record ideas, things I have done, and a lot more. There is no worrying about what journal to put it in, or styling to mess about with, just saving numerous things effortlessly. As you can see from my screenshots, I’ve taken to adding thoughts on how my training runs have gone, some podcast notes and even some blog post ideas — all in one place.</p>\n<p>The app is not perfect, there’s no Mac or iPad app to start with. You could achieve the same result by simplifying Day One, as it <a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com/blog/introducing-journaling-suggestions/\">also has access to the new Journalling suggestions</a>, found by starting a new post and tapping the magic wand icon. I, personally, don’t need all the extra bits that Day One offers, so I can remove <em>another</em> cost from my subscriptions and still get all the benefits of journalling. If I can <a href=\"/2023/12/19/the-unremarkable-chronicles.html\">work out what to write</a>!</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>For years, I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out why my handwriting is so bad. Seriously, it&rsquo;s like what you&rsquo;d expect from a three-year-old. I often blame my years in higher education – anyone who&rsquo;s been through it knows that, unless you really put in the effort, your handwriting just stagnates after school. Everything has to be typed up neatly before submission, making pen and paper seem redundant.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m digressing a bit, but that&rsquo;s usually my go-to explanation when, much to my dismay, someone catches a glimpse of my writing. This issue really came to the forefront recently when I had to write out some Christmas cards, a task I normally leave to my wife, who has flawless handwriting. Confronted with the task of writing on the cards, I was appalled at the mess I&rsquo;d made.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s odd is my fondness for jotting notes in a physical notebook. The brief notes and thoughts I jot down often require some deciphering, but it&rsquo;s when I have to write at length that my handwriting really deteriorates. Whenever I write morning pages, I choose to type them, contrary to popular advice to write them manually. I attribute this to my ability to type quickly enough to keep up with my thoughts, a realisation that recently struck me as the real issue.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/41673fd9c0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Before I started using Day One <a href=\"/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html\">in January last year</a>, I watched every review and setup video available. Many emphasised the speed of typing over handwriting, and I agreed. My hand couldn&rsquo;t match the pace of my thoughts, which I saw as a drawback. So, I decided to subscribe and type instead of writing by hand. In reality, I didn&rsquo;t need to speed up my writing to match my thoughts; instead, I needed to slow my thoughts to match my writing pace.</p>\n<p>This shift transformed an already effective practice for the better. My hand stopped cramping, and my words became clearer as I stopped rushing. Most importantly, I slowed my thought process to match my handwriting pace, allowing me to maintain and focus on my thoughts longer. In my haste to express and release them, I hadn&rsquo;t been giving them the necessary space. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still <a href=\"/2023/12/19/the-unremarkable-chronicles.html\">struggle with what to write half the time</a>, but now, I relish the process of slowly and thoughtfully putting pen to paper.</p>\n",

If you&rsquo;re relying on prompts from the new journal API to spice up your daily entries, like I am, you to might hit a snag if your life is as uneventful as mine tends to be.</p>\n<p>My mornings kick off religiously at 6am. It&rsquo;s a straightforward routine: get everything ready for Lucie&rsquo;s school departure a bit past 7, enjoy a solitary coffee, then play chauffeur for my wife to take her to work. Once back home, I&rsquo;m hunkered down in my home office, with film soundtracks as my loyal companions. Sounds like a script for a riveting blockbuster, right? Not exactly.</p>\n<p>Sure, there are occasional deviations from the script. I go running, and sprinkle in the occasional podcasts. But really, what grand tales are there to narrate in a journal? It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m scaling mountains or traversing exotic jungles. What do you write about when your life doesn’t venture beyond the ordinary? Definitely not more navel-gazing or empty promises of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write more journal entries. I really super-duper promise this time”.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4243e890ac.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s my very ordinariness that poses such a challenge to me. I realise that I am comparing <a href=\"/2021/05/31/insides-vs-outsides.html\">my insides to other people&rsquo;s outsides</a> when I look for inspiration online. Yet still wonder how to make the mundane interesting? This also bleeds into my photography, I don’t go anywhere, nor do anything, intriguing. How do I find stories worth telling in a day that unfolds with the predictability of a sitcom rerun?</p>\n<p>I don’t struggle for ideas for blog posts because they often abstract. Not born from my boring existence, created from a mind that wanders further than my feet. I can’t tell tales of my existence because there are none to tell. Don’t get me wrong, I am content with the predictability of my regular life, after all, not every day needs to be a headline-worthy adventure. I just long for some narrative to tell from within the folds of the everyday.</p>\n",

I had this <a href=\"/2023/02/11/do-i-even.html\">idea in my head</a> that I&rsquo;d be one of those people with a <a href=\"/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html\">notebook always at hand</a>, filled with insightful notes and daily reflections. Ready to write the best blog posts you’ve ever read — but the truth is, it wasn&rsquo;t working out like that. I went on holiday this summer and didn&rsquo;t miss scribbling in my notebook, which made me stop and think.</p>\n<p>There was <a href=\"/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html\">a time around last Christmas</a> when I was really into it. I had convinced myself that this daily writing was the key to my happiness. But after a while, I realised that it wasn&rsquo;t the act of writing that made me happy; it was me figuring out things for myself. Sure, the people and things I care about (like my family) can give me a boost, but at the end of the day, my happiness is up to me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/62011d1bd4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s something about writing by hand that feels right to me, even though it&rsquo;s slower than typing, and you can&rsquo;t just hit &lsquo;search&rsquo; to find something you wrote. But for some reason, I just stopped using my notebook for a few months. It&rsquo;s like it went into hibernation or something. Eventually, it just stopped being a part of my routine, and by the time summer came around, I had stopped using it altogether.</p>\n<p>One has always been close by, but just sitting and waiting for me to pick it back up again. I had the occasional flick through it to find an idea or a quote I remember writing down, but always placing it back down again with a promise to start using it once more. Perhaps that day is today. Well, the past week or so, actually. I drew a line under everything, metaphorically and physically. I&rsquo;ve got a new notebook now, and I&rsquo;m ready to give it another shot.</p>\n<p>Notebooks might come and go, but I&rsquo;m sticking with it.</p>\n",

That gets all the disclaimers out of the way and makes my probable bias obvious right from the start. However, there is something about reading books that not only entertains me but means I learn more along the way, and the web will never replace that.</p>\n<p>Books receive a lot of criticism. Even perceived intellectuals, like the now-disgraced crypto guru SBF, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/29/sam-bankman-fried-reading-effective-altruism/\">fail to see the value in books</a>. They are denounced as “too slow” or not “entertaining enough” by a range of people who seem to think information should be mainlined into their veins. There is more to reading a book specifically that many people seem to miss - and <a href=\"/2022/04/10/reading-doesnxt-need.html\">reading doesn’t need to be hacked</a>!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7ce720a7ca.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The entire experience of touching and turning pages might seem redundant, but that tactile chore is the very point. Research by <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227608869_Hypertext_fiction_reading_Haptics_and_immersion\">Anne Mangen has shown</a> a crucial link between the sensory and motor experience of reading a physical book. It draws not just on our sense of sight but also on our sense of touch, changing the depth of attention paid to words on a page compared to words on a screen.</p>\n<p>My personal ranting about <a href=\"/2023/06/29/find-the-what.html\">books that should have been blog posts</a> does hide my enjoyment of reading them. There is something enjoyable about taking in someone’s prose that goes around the houses a bit and reinforces their ideas with real-life examples. While straight-to-the-point blog posts, like the one you’re reading now, have their place, there is joy in the ramble. The slow pulling back of the curtain to reveal new ideas, rather than a yanking of the cover and pointing, is delightful.</p>\n<p>I am reminded of the habit all students get into of relying on Cliffnotes for books they&rsquo;re supposed to read. Shoving the information straight into my brain instead of the steady drip from long text never worked. Nowadays, there are several companies out there summarising books and even films so you can act as if you consumed the content without actually doing the work. All of which achieve results, but lack that something special.</p>\n<p>Much like my <a href=\"/2019/04/29/skipping-silence.html\">enjoyment of the pauses in podcasts</a>, I think this comes from my tendency to <a href=\"/2023/09/09/i-enjoy-being.html\">enjoy being slow</a>, but I find taking the time to read a book. A ‘real’ book if I can, adds so much to the enjoyment.</p>\n",

I fail at so many things that perhaps I am desensitised to the whole experience, but there is absolutely nothing to fear from not getting the result you wanted.</p>\n<p>I should preface this with a warning about taking unneeded risks and not ruining things that make huge changes to your life — but outside this, fail hard and often. Failure is the way you find out what suits you best. It’s the way to round off the corners of all the square things you find to make sure something fits as you need it to. As Alain de Botton <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success\">elegantly put it</a> “It’s bad enough not getting what you want, but it’s even worse getting to the end and realising it isn’t what you wanted”.</p>\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/d03f197ae4.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>How on earth do you even know what you want without failing at a million things first?

All which fell flat on their face, and from the failure I learnt lessons, and improved the way my life works.</p>\n<p>None of these things I pointed out above matter, it’s easy to fail at these things. Don’t even get me started on the declined job applications, rebuffed dating advances and miserable attempts at being a writer. A<a href=\"/2022/01/06/it-depends-on.html\">t the time some of them seemed like world ending events</a>, but I learnt things, I worked out what I wanted and and moved forward. </p>\n<p>In many way I learnt how to fail and now I will never shy away from trying new things. Exploring my thoughts around subjects. Working out a millions ways to do a job before I dive in. Throwing a high percentage of draft blog posts into the bin. There is nothing wrong with any of these things, it is the not doing part that sucks. The wondering what if, or the missed opportunity because fear froze you. That sucks, failure doesn’t. </p>\n",

A time pre-smartphone, where everything didn’t rely on my having a computer in my pocket — whilst also loving technology. There is no getting away from the feelings, but I have become to realise that if you are not paying attention, how ridiculous the pursuit of less can become.</p>\n<p>One of my favourite sub-Reddits is <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbphones/\">r/dumbphones</a>, it is wonderful to see the phones people are still using and the ones available if you look hard enough. From old school Nokia remakes to <a href=\"https://www.catphones.com/en-us/cat-s22-flip/\">mixes of flip phone keypads and Android</a>. One of the post tends recently has been everyday carries, and seeing people using a flip phone and a notepad gives me hope. Then I see others lugging around a dumb phone, MP3 player, camera, kindle, and even more things — and that brings me back to reality.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3b998d1faa.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This was one of the reasons I failed my flip phone experiment. At some point, you just have to realise that all this stuff is a bit ridiculous. This is no slight against the person posting in the screenshot above, it is more a revelation for me. The reason smartphones caught on so quickly is they cannibalised all of these extra things we used to carry around. They made our life easier, and going backwards is not always the way.</p>\n<p>By having a smartphone in my pocket, am I actually making my life simpler. I have in my pocket a camera, kindle, music player, writing device and much more. There is a lot to be said for <a href=\"/2019/12/17/intentional-barriers.html\">intentional barriers</a> but carrying around all of these extra things doesn’t simplify anything. It just adds complexity. To carry on using a flip phone, past the week or so I managed, I would need to buy more devices when I can just exercise some self-control.</p>\n<p>Which indeed is easier said than done, but it’s something to think about. I’m not completely convinced by <a href=\"https://stolenfocusbook.com/audio/\">Nir Eyal and his insistence that destruction is our personal fault</a>, but I must take some responsibility. The solution is often not a worse experience, it is just to use the tool you have, well.</p>\n",

I&rsquo;m not even sure when I began to wear them for my walks, but their sudden absence made me acutely aware of my new routine.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7ea0c883a0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>image generated by DALL-E3</em></div>\n<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my walk today. There’s something special about the slight chill in the air paired with the warmth of the sun that I find delightful. It&rsquo;s an odd time of year when you need both a hat and gloves as well as sunglasses, but I think it&rsquo;s the perfect balance. That might seem like a tangent, but perhaps being alone with my thoughts allowed me to appreciate it more. Unwittingly, I had been walking with my AirPods for the last few days, listening to podcasts or audiobooks, which meant I was never truly alone.</p>\n<p>Of course, there’s nothing inherently wrong with listening to something while walking. However, I find that excessive consumption of content prevents me from fully developing my own ideas. The ideas I do have, influenced by various media, never seem to fully materialise or reach a conclusion if there’s a constant influx of new ones. Podcasts, in particular, tend to spark new thoughts or introduce intriguing topics, but I <em>need</em> those interludes of silence to explore and expand on them before moving on to the next.</p>\n<p>There are already numerous thoughts occupying space in my mind, most of which I tend to overanalyse, without the addition of new ones pouring in. That is why <a href=\"/2021/03/14/the-importance-of.html\">I value silence</a> and downtime so much. It enables me to read a book, jot down notes, or just <a href=\"/2023/09/09/i-enjoy-being.html\">embrace a slower pace</a>, which in turn allows me to operate at full capacity when necessary. However, this doesn&rsquo;t make it any easier when <a href=\"https://wheresyoured.at/p/sam-altman-freed\">a company I am interested in implodes</a> over the course of a week leading to an influx of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/podcasts/hard-fork-altman-openai-rehired.html\">emergency podcasts</a>!</p>\n<p>Over the years, I have learned to appreciate the uncomfortable sensation of boredom and not to shun it. I see many people who cannot stand to be unoccupied, and I believe that being comfortable with boredom is an important skill for self-discovery. The desire for constant entertainment is pervasive and seems problematic. As I discovered today, despite the world being filled with distractions, sometimes all I really need is silence.</p>\n",

				"title": "My Big Flip Phone Failure",
				"content_html": "<p>I have been trying to write this post for a very long time. Trying to outline my <a href=\"/2023/08/23/my-big-flip.html\">experiment of using a flip phone again</a> because it is the culmination of a few years of wanting to try it, knowing I can’t and then slowly walking myself back from the edge. This time my wife pushed me over the edge with words along the line of “stop talking about it and do it” with comical results and some realisations along the way.</p>\n<p>I say this with the knowledge that I have written and rewritten this post quite a few times. I hoped that my thoughts would come easily as they are plentiful, but my fear was that they could be judged as more than a little preachy. This would have destroyed the message behind this post and removed any hope of people reading it. So I hope this version finds the right spot in your motivation to keep reading. It circles a realisation I had about a week into the experiment and applies to numerous things in tech circles.</p>\n<p>On the first boot of my sim being in a new Nokia 2660, I hit barriers. The phone cost me a whopping £25 from a local business and ticked all the boxes I wanted it to tick, but the barriers came from other places. There is no way to transfer contacts over, so I had to spend quite a bit of time doing the new phone dance that people of a certain age will remember. Typing all the numbers and contact names in on the t9 keypad, that after ten minutes, made my hand cramp. I used to be able to send a text without even looking, and although some muscle memory remained, the dexterity to do so did not.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/be322f6dde.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Once this was done, I put the phone down and stared at it. You see, the great thing about a dumb phone, although this particular model <em>did</em> have Facebook installed, is that there is nothing to do with it. Outside the occasional game of snake, unless the phone beeped, or I needed to contact someone, it never moved from the table in my kitchen. For something to do, I even when and connected it to my car&rsquo;s bluetooth, which went about as easily as any other phone I have used. Which was frustrating because I expected to hit more annoyances than this. How dare this ridiculous phone be easy to use and peaceful.</p>\n<p>Truth be told, for the first couple of days, I wished we had never moved past this stage in the mobile phone evolution. I wanted to stay with this device that asked absolutely nothing from me. It delivered on everything it promises, which is next to nothing, and that was one with me. That&rsquo;s the thing about weekends though, they are not the indicator of normal usage, and once the week rolled around I was sure the issues would start showing up. Secretly hoping I would have a good enough excuse to shove my sim back into a phone it deserved. Unfortunately, nothing major happened.</p>\n<p>The calls were answered. Texts were replaced with telephone calls because it couldn’t be bothered to give myself hand cramp. Most importantly, no-one was any the wiser. This marvellous device sat on my desk next to my computer and did exactly what was asked of it. It wasn’t until the dawn of the third day that I began to release what I needed from a phone. It came in the most embarrassing of situations, at the front of a queue of people trying to pay for something. My card would not work for whatever reason and I had no way of getting another one, nor using a banking app.</p>\n<p>I walked away in a grump, with my dumb phone in my hand and simmering over imagined sniggering from people in the queue behind. Curse my desire for a simple life and not having the world at my fingertips when I most needed it. It suddenly occurred to me — well once I had been home, sorted my card out, and then gone to a <em>different shop</em> to buy the things I required — that I do need my device to do more. I began to think of all the occasions where I might need a device with me. Quickly putting together ideas of how I could overcome them.</p>\n<p>I ran through them all in my mind to make sure I could solve these problems and continue in blissful device silence. Banking was simple. I return to carrying a wallet with me at all times. The next one was running, that would require a new watch because I can’t use my beloved Apple Watch now. Something simple will do, a cheep Casio and a good route planning session to log my milage means I can jump that hurdle effortlessly. Podcasts on long runs might take a bit more thought.</p>\n<p>After exploring the web for MP3 devices, which there are quite a few of even with the rise of smartphones, the possibility of more expenditure started to pull the curtain down on my experiment. Not because of the cost, a simple MP3 player with bluetooth is around £40, but more because of the hassle. I could download the episodes I want to listen to, convert them to MP3 and then put them on the device. Worry about keeping it charged and tracking my run on a new watch. Or I could just use Apple Watch as I have done for years.</p>\n<p>I could ask for paper menus and order forms in places that relied on QR code scanning or online ordering. Printing out things I needed to have with me, or writing them in <a href=\"/2023/03/12/what-is-my.html\">my notebook</a>. All the issues that cropped up had solutions, but after a certain point the juice wasn’t worth the squeeze. Despite all the attention it tended to suck away, and all the outlay it cost — the smartphone has pushed itself into my life to such a point that it is just easier to have one. That sucks.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>There are numerous tech things I am intentionally quiet about. Not because I don’t have thoughts about them, but because I would rather not add to the noise of initial emotion blog posts and hot takes. The <a href=\"https://hu.ma.ne/aipin\">Humane AI Pin</a> was one of those things, and while I don’t see it catching on, I think it is a fascinating device because of what it signals.</p>\n<p>For years now, technology commentators have been theorising on what comes after the smartphone. It’s explosive success in shaping our lives and how we interact with the world around us is nothing short of remarkable. Although we can debate the positivity of them, there is no denying that the societal changes we have experienced well exceed those caused by similar cultural shifts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f85131c6f4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This oblong glass and metal device I am typing this blog post on is nothing short of a technological marvel. One that we could not even dream of a decade ago, yet we are searching for <em>the next thing</em> already. For years, many people have been expecting voice first interaction to become the prominent interaction method. No more typing on screens, you speak to something, and it does the heavy lifting for you. It’s easy to forget this vision of easier interaction with your device and view the Ai Pin from its marketing alone.</p>\n<p>Right from the start, the device has been developed and now launched differently to what we expected. There’s nothing wrong with that, but the self-importance of the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/882968794\">companies launch video</a> overshadows the entire device. The successfulness of the device aside (I am very much of the opinion it will fall flat on its face) it says a lot about the future of devices. The one seen by technology investors, and how much they differentiate from regular users.</p>\n<p>Although voice first interaction hasn’t caught on as quickly as expected, and many devices have had to go back to putting screens on them, there’s still <em>something</em> there. It’s either a dream, or a marketing push, but the voice first idea clings to the back of my mind with a certain level of excitement. It wasn’t until I really thought about the ridiculousness of wearing a pin on my clothes, or the worse possibility of <a href=\"/2016/10/10/please-dont-put.html\">something on my face</a>, that I came to understand the issues as I see them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/46e0c533ff.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The truth is, voice first doesn’t need to be voice only. Now granted, the AI Pin <em>does</em> have an over-engineered laser projector. This requires a series of dexterous gestures to interact, which in itself is enough to pull your phone out and do the same thing in a couple of taps. What they really want you to do is push the button and talk to it. Transmitting everything over the constant internet connection to be interpreted, and a response beamed back to you. Let’s hope you never go out of a reliable signal.</p>\n<p>You can issue commands like “catch me up” to be read your latest emails and text messages. A command that I expect won&rsquo;t return “nothing, no one likes you” but speaks to the kind of person AI wants to market the device to, or perhaps who purchasers wish to be. This is something that may not raise an eyebrow in Silicon Valley circles, but <em>will</em> on your local high street. What companies fail to realise that the acceptability of voice interaction is varied, and this device must sit in the Venn diagram overlap of <em>can talk to a computer</em> and <em>wearing clothes sufficient to sustain <a href=\"https://musictech.com/news/gear/humane-ai-pin/#:~:text=It%27s%20a%20small%2C%20square%20device,can%20be%20attached%20to%20clothing.\">“the same weight as a tennis ball”.</a></em></p>\n<p>I suspect this sits is the same tech douch zone as Juicero, Google Glass and Dyson Zone. The aims of Humane are noble ones, to reduce the time spent using devices that take us away from the world around us. Ensuring that we can use technology in a way that doesn’t impact our attention. Forgetting that there is a far more socially acceptable option of device, one that I am a big fan of—the smartwatch.</p>\n<p>After years of wearing an Apple Watch, my preferred interaction method with it, outside simple taps, is by far voice. The watch is already a device people are used to seeing, it fits into life perfectly. There’s nothing on my face and no weird badge sagging my clothes down. I remain convinced it is the best <a href=\"/2022/02/10/the-ultimate-minimalist.html\">minimalist phone you can buy</a>, and wish it were my main device. I have a feeling that had Humane stated with such a device and then pushed into other areas it may have gone down better, but there is always a desire for something new and different.</p>\n<p>A new interaction method takes time to find its space in society, like the smartphone. Some never reach that place and die out like Google Glass, and it remains to be seen how long Humane can hang in there. Working to persuade people that the learning curve is worth it. Voice first and lasers seems like an interesting proposition, but new doesn’t always mean good.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I spotted an <a href=\"https://c.im/@nickheer/111412577184081322\">interesting post by Nick Heer</a> this morning while catching up (also, you should be <a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/\">reading his blog</a>; it’s great). He presents the idea that sometimes hardware is as much of a barrier to switching platforms as software is, which is often overlooked by those considering doing so.</p>\n<p>The barrier to switching from, say, an iPhone to Android is usually thought to be software — iMessage, for instance, comes up frequently. However, I think Nick has a valid point worth considering. I started to think about the reasons why I tend to stick with Apple products, particularly the iPhone, and really, it boils down to three areas: hardware quality, with a focus on the camera, and the app ecosystem.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/37ddba125b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"hardware\">Hardware</h2>\n<p>I have written about <a href=\"/2020/11/14/my-journey-to.html\">my journey of becoming entrenched in the Apple ecosystem</a>. Until the iPhone 5s, I was a dedicated Android user. I had used the iPhone 3G for a while but didn’t truly enjoy it, and bought my first Android phone, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus\">Galaxy Nexus</a>. The reason I switched to an iPhone, after a considerable succession of Android phones that never really met the mark, was the hardware.</p>\n<p>They all promised to fix short battery life or offer a camera that wasn’t subpar, and I was fed up with having to hack my phone to make it work well. I enjoyed using phones like the Moto X and the Nexus series, but they all left me feeling overall disappointment. The iPhone 5s resolved all the issues I had with poor build quality and disappointing hardware in one fell swoop. It came in a high-quality, really nice feeling package, and I no longer worried about capturing a good photo.</p>\n<p>Taking good pictures on Android phones was too laborious. I had to install other camera apps or make other technical adjustments to achieve the desired results. I don’t feel that is the case any more; Android phones are on par with the hardware quality of iPhones, offering more interesting form factors beyond the glass and metal oblong Apple adheres to.</p>\n<p>I am no stranger to using Android phones, having recently used the Galaxy Z Fold 5, Pixel Fold, and S23 Ultra for an extended period. What now affects switching is my completely subjective opinion on the pictures from these phones. I am not a fan of the oversaturated Samsung images, nor the processing of the Pixel phones. So, I now stick to iPhones due to my personal tastes; there is no other barrier apart from <em>my</em> preference.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/743ab8da23.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"software\">Software</h2>\n<p>I used to love Android for its utility, constant introduction of new features, and the freedom to customise my phone as I desired. Much of that remains true; however, every time I use it now, I am confused about whose phone it is. Android, in its various forms, seems to push Google services in my face, or adverts if you use a Samsung phone.</p>\n<p>The good news is you can usually turn most of these features off and make the phone your own. It just takes more time than it used to, and compared to iPhones, it offers a level of customisation that Apple will never allow. Comparing the OS is a bit like comparing apples to oranges, but what I particularly dislike is the disparity in app quality.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2b8dfd65f8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This might be down to the types of apps I use and the fact that I first used them on Apple devices. However, that doesn’t excuse the inferior quality of some cross-platform attempts. That is, if the app is even available, as the likes of <a href=\"https://hq.getmatter.com\">Matter</a> and <a href=\"https://ulysses.app\">Ulysses</a> just aren’t there. This is no fault of Google or Android, but it is a consideration when thinking about switching. It keeps me using iOS instead of searching for alternatives; the cost versus reward doesn’t add up <strong>for me</strong>.</p>\n<p>Another point worth mentioning, and what was the deciding factor in getting an iPhone in the first place, is the ecosystem. I was introduced to it with an iPad. I won&rsquo;t ever switch to Windows unless forced, so it just makes sense for me to have the whole Apple package. Every so often, I think I am one of the iSheep people mock, but if that’s the case, I am content knowing what to do and how to get the most out of my ecosystem. Even if, at times, it is frustrating to be so confined.</p>\n",

So I&rsquo;d like to share a few thoughts on its recent updates and the celebration of its seventh anniversary. The past year has brought notable changes, including their 2.0 update, and the improvements coming look fascinating.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/288ff7e140.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Bear 2 launched in July with significant updates including tables, nested styles, pinned tags, and <a href=\"https://blog.bear.app/2023/07/bear-2-is-here/\">quite a bit more</a>. My biggest takeaway from testing the beta for a few months was the cleaner Markdown formatting. It tidied up all the issues I have with most other Markdown editors and allowed me to write my favoured way but not have too much markup in the way. It also brought in folding text sections, sketching tools on iOS, GIF support, and footnotes among other things.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a5fa9bdcf7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"an-anniversary-with-basic-apple-guy\">An Anniversary With Basic Apple Guy</h2>\n<p>The new update for their anniversary brought in new customisation options, including a collaboration with <a href=\"https://basicappleguy.com\">Basic Apple Guy</a> for a new icon is an interesting move, highlighting Bear&rsquo;s engagement with the wider Apple community. It’s a neat addition for fans of both the app and Apple-themed designs.</p>\n<p>In their <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/shinyfrog/bear-turns-7?e=0fbdccc28f\">recent email</a> they also highlighted an upcoming Quick Open UI on Mac which looks really helpful. It’s good to see an app evolve based on user needs, and for such a niche note-taking app to be around for 7 years later makes me happy. It has some really engaged users, and their development over time, although slow, is very responsive to what its users want.</p>\n<p>If you are <a href=\"/2021/03/19/looking-for-my.html\">looking for a more advanced note app</a> that doesn’t overcomplicate things, I will always point to Bear Notes. They don’t pay me or anything, I just think it’s a really great, well-designed app and long may it continue.</p>\n",

It is a full-on capitalist franchise, Costa Coffee. That is a bit OTT because I quite like Costa Coffee and the staff in this one are always nice. I also can’t complain about a place that I can park freely right outside and not have to worry about navigating shoppers.</p>\n<p>There’s no wave of MacBooks this time either, the place isn’t empty, but it’s full of people meeting and actually drinking coffee. As such, I feel really self-conscious sat typing on this massive laptop, but I am sure I am not far away from it being full of people tapping away whist taking Friday night sales calls - speaking from experience.</p>\n<p>I am already used to the keyboard positioning on the 16” MacBook, but I still have a few reservations and wholeheartedly think that the 14” is the version people should go for. However, I love the larger screen and doing some design work, which is precisely what I should be doing now, is <em>actually</em> possible away from a monitor.</p>\n<p>I guess it always was, but never the best experience. Working on elements are much easier to see, and I enjoy working out and about now. Perhaps that is what much of the 16” MacBook, and even which MacBook to buy as a whole, is about. Most things are possible on all versions, but ‘better’ specs can make your tasks more enjoyable and you need to weigh up where the line is.</p>\n<p>If the only difference that upgrading my laptop has made is being able to work in more places, that to me is worth it. It is easily £3,000 worth of value and enjoyment, but would be complete overkill for others.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I love a good blogging trend, me. I don’t always join in with them, but this time around it has even brought <a href=\"https://acn.lol/2023/11/07/default-apps\">Andy Nicolaides out of retirement</a>. So I thought about sharing mine. Deciding against it in the end because I don’t have much to share, but as <a href=\"/2023/11/08/coffee-shop-adventures.html\">I said yesterday</a>, I have embraced the fact that I have to have a good think about why first.</p>\n<p>This trend is sharing the default apps we are using. Nothing more. It asks very little of a person, but we all know that it says a lot about us instead. I’ve seen some replies similar to “what an Apple fanboy” but in the general sense, we are all searching for that special needle in a haystack “Ah Hah” moment of finding something new.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5a927afc22.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We are constantly told that technology improvements are not exciting any more. I would disagree, particularly currently, due to augmented reality and AI promising a different computer interaction paradigm. There is some admission though that most new products don’t scratch the itch they used to. The days of massive improvement when a new OS came out, or my Android faithful will remember waiting for a new ROM release was enough excitement to keep you up at night.</p>\n<p>Now, particularly in the apps space, everything seems like the last one that went before it and very little improvement to be found. Unless, of course, you can dig through the recommendations of those with a similar use cases to you and find out what they are using. I have avoided such a process, and read very few of them because I know I will find an app, and <a href=\"/2019/07/29/a-new-productivity.html\">be off down a rabbit hole</a> and spend more time moving things around.</p>\n<p>As such, I tend to stick to default apps unless I hit a ceiling. Apps like Fantastical sit in place of Apple calendar because it displays information better for working and time blocking. Todoist manages my tasks because it is easer to get them in and schedule them around. Take away my working life, and none of these types of apps make sense for me to use. The only shout-out I could possibly give is for <a href=\"https://getmatter.app\">Matter</a> - but again, it is very niche and expensive if you&rsquo;re not into saving lots of content.</p>\n<p>I apologise for being boring, I wish you all the best in finding new and exciting things. Don’t spend too much money but enjoy yourselves!</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Bar a couple of months in early 2022, I have been working from home now for more than three years. It&rsquo;s a great existence, means in can concentrate better, look after my beloved dog and also be around for my family in the school holidays. I would however like to mention that it can be a bit lonely at times and I want to change that no my contract is fully remote.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons I went with a 16” MacBook this time was the idea that I could work a bit better away from home, and as my m3 pro was delivered yesterday, off I went. I wouldn&rsquo;t feel myself if I didn&rsquo;t have a bit of think about why I wanted to go though. SO it took me a couple of hours to talk myself into it.</p>\n<p>I didn’t want this to be an adventure of ego. You’ve seen the people I am talking about. MacBook Pro out, headphones on, not really doing much but want to be seen with their shiny laptop. I would rather not be one of those people. I definitely wasn’t going to out to show off my new Space Black MacBook. I don’t think.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/789763965e.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Anyway. I wasn’t alone. It appears that everyone does this. I went to a nice local family run place called <a href=\"https://kitchenandcoffee.co.uk\">Kitchen and Coffee</a> that brews nice drinks and the tables were awash with MacBooks. Just MacBooks. No other type of computer to be seen, which, I thought was weird. No other Space Black ones, I checked. Twice. Certainly, not showing off, I think.</p>\n<p>I don’t feel uncomfortable opening this massive machine and typing away on what seems to be the same size keyboard as my old 14” but dwarfed by speakers on either side that are throwing off my typing. I hadn’t realised just how much of my finger placement was dependent on feeling the sides of my laptop with my hands, and I am conscious of hitting the ginormous trackpad, so my wrists hurt already.</p>\n<p>Why is the trackpad so massive though? There&rsquo;s no reason for it. No added benefit or increased functionality. It’s just there to fill the space, what a weird design choice. Now I am staring at my laptop weirdly, and I am conscious people are looking. The good thing is that it seems to reject my palms resting on it, so no false touches to report as yet.</p>\n<p>Just as I am starting to think this purchase was a mistake and running through my options to return it and buy a smaller version, I realise the size of the screen. I have two windows open side by side and can see both of them perfectly. Who would have thought that 2-inches of screen size make such a difference. I never once thought my old one was small, but this is positively mind-bending. Perhaps I was right all along and this <em>will</em> enable me to work outside the house more.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more coffee shop adventures to come. I need to find a quieter place though.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Every so often I get stuck between a few bits of content I consume and suddenly an idea clicks. It might take a while to flesh it out, and work out if I haven’t got things backwards and just have some kind of frequency illusion of ideas. This one clicked straight away. Whilst listening to <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-vergecast/id430333725?i=1000633582783\">The Verge cast from last Friday,</a> I suddenly realised that Google and SEO could be ruining blogging.</p>\n<p>That statement is a little hyperbolic, but bear with me here. For me to try to explain myself, I need to pull in from the various bloggers that seem to systematically have a cyclical but at the times the appearance of an existential criss. We all, <a href=\"/2023/04/17/trying-to-write.html\">my self included</a>, <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/10/some-musings-on-how-to-write-more/\">wonder why</a> we bother <a href=\"https://joelhooks.com/on-writing-more\">writing any more</a>. That’s because we are told this activity is, <a href=\"https://comradeweb.com/blog/do-i-really-need-a-blog/\">and should be</a>, winnable.</p>\n<p>You too, can live off the income from adverts, be sent nice things for free and reach the top of Google if you just sacrifice these things. Write about these topics, or think this way, or SEO your words beyond recognition. That’s how you win blogging and get loads of clicks. When blogging doesn’t need winning, it only leads to a sense of <a href=\"https://getmatter.com/email/34369715/?token=34369715%3AruhSSCftwzHjx9WvCOVxmkx9Gvs\">why bother putting this out into the world</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/703bcb8809.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I understand that the idea that every post you publish needs to have a utility to the world is ridiculous. Whilst at the same time, by stopping and looking around online at the content farms and self-professed “winners” it is also a completely understandable reaction to have. At times, I feel like my blog has to look and function a certain way, so I can somehow be “of use” to the rest of the web. When in reality no one searches my posts, no one clicks the pagination, and that’s absolutely fine.</p>\n<p>This isn’t another don’t do it for others, do it for yourself post - there are enough of them online. It’s a realisation that one of the backbones of the web, Google search ranking, and to a certain extent, social media, has ruined so much of it. There are a huge number of people still blogging and not giving a damn, but many more that don’t bother because of these feelings.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we are edging our way back towards a better social web that encourages blogging more, or perhaps this is just wishful thinking. One thing I am certain of is that a lot of blogging has been ruined already, and it will take a concerted effort from us all to build it back up again.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Think way back to 2016. The X-Files <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files_(season_10)\">came back after 14 years</a>, a 4-inch lock of John Lennon&rsquo;s hair sold for $35,000 and there was a baby born with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/27/worlds-first-baby-born-using-dna-from-three-parents\">DNA from three parents</a>. Weirdness all around, especially on the Apple campus. They were convinced the iPad was the future of computing, deep into “<a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-airs-new-ipad-pro-commercial-asks-whats-a-computer/\" title=\"what is a computer\">what’s a computer</a>” thinking yet still produced laptops with 3-year-old chips in them. Whilst everyone pointed towards a touchscreen Mac, they instead gave users a weird strip you could interact with and took away their function keys.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/39a423b65c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>You can theorise the motives for this for longer than the Touch Bar should have existed. It lasted for at least double its realistic life span and was finally killed at Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast-apples-keynote-event-shot-on-iphone/\">Scary Fast event</a> last week. I bought one as soon as it was released, partly because I was desperate for an upgrade from my aging 2012 version, and partly because I was interested in where the Touch Bar would go. Convinced that Apple would turn this into a new interaction paradigm, and oh how wrong could I have been?</p>\n<p>Looking back, I don’t think my confidence was completely unfounded. Apple has a history of being brave, this was the year of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12838024/apple-iphone-7-plus-headphone-jack-removal-courage\">#courage</a> after all. Even more so when it <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/219603/apple-and-the-incredible-vanishing-cd-drive.html\">came to computing,</a> and they usually got it right, or forced everyone else to concede. Whichever way it happened, my expectation was that the Touch Bar would become a selling point of the Mac. Unfortunately for Apple, they forgot that users who buy their ‘pro’ laptops, rely on the function keys — especially the doubled sized one marked escape.</p>\n<p>The issue wasn’t that the Touch Bar was there, although questions of its utility dominated early reviews, it was that it now took multiple taps and more concentration to do simple tasks. Your use case may vary, but that was something I could put up with had the Touch Bar shown a real use case outside gimmicky scrubbing through timelines or swiping through photos. It felt half-baked at best, and thrown in to appease users demanding more from their Macs.</p>\n<p>Some people believe this was to refresh the line before the real improvements of the M1 chip brought. However, hindsight is always 20/20. I think in reality, Apple saw this as a quick, easy fix to satiate those asking for touchscreens, as well as a perfect aid to the second generation butterfly keyboards. Unfortunately it appeared as a gimmick, got little to no support from Apple, and remained as a gimmick through its life span.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I think it’s a shame that poor implementation ruined a semi-good idea. Apple clearly thought that this was going to catch on because the life span indicates so. My understanding is that production and lack of sales supported the entry-level MacBook having one for so long due to the cost of inventory. The design and production of the Touch Bar would make a great story, one we will continue to talk about for years to come. I can only dream of what would have been had they just put it above the function keys instead.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I got you with the clickbait headline. I mean it’s true, but as with most things, the real answer is: It depends. I read with excitement David Pierce&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/23/23928550/posse-posting-activitypub-standard-twitter-tumblr-mastodon\">article on POSSE for The Verge,</a> as if it were some new technology to change the internet. The framing of the article aside, it is rare to see such excitement about boring indie web things <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23689570/activitypub-protocol-standard-social-network\">like ActivityPub</a> from the tech media. It feels as if one of the founding ideas of the internet, that one&rsquo;s personal website should be the cornerstone, has returned like the proverbial prodigal son — and I love it!</p>\n<p>This is a topic that is very close to my heart, one that has existed for decades but is gaining more traction since the demise of Twitter and the rise of X. I intentionally write about those two things as separate entities as I believe the start of one signalled the end of the other. David’s post is because of a wider spark and interest in the things that should have been building the web for a long time, as we escape from the web silos that have kept our content for themselves.</p>\n<p>The idea is simple, it’s right there in the name, you Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. So everything that you want to post — whether it be an image, an article, a link, whatever — goes on <em>your</em> website. Whether you wish to call that a blog or not is up to you, but the salient fact is that you post it to a space you own. We could go deeper into the fact that you’re just renting space online from more gatekeepers, but I am not ready for that just yet.</p>\n<p>In theory, this makes the most sense. You own all the content you put online, your <a href=\"https://www.patrickrhone.net/4480-2/\">Twitter thread that should have been a blog post</a>, now <em>is</em> a blog post. Should the site you posted to go away, or you choose to leave, you still have the <em>thing</em> you posted. The problem is: The idea starts to break down when you consider that very few areas of the internet let you do this, and even if they do, it isn’t really correct and it&rsquo;s far too much work.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Networks have different audiences, different people, different norms, different ways of engaging with the system. At some point, if you&rsquo;re just posting to a bunch of places all at once, aren&rsquo;t you basically spam? — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/23/23928550/posse-posting-activitypub-standard-twitter-tumblr-mastodon\">David Pierce</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dave Winer wrote <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/10/23/220342.html\">the initial response</a> I stumbled upon, who points out this fact articulately. There is an issue when POSSE is often synonymous with cross posting to different websites, and that relies on them all supporting the content you want to post in the same way. Should they do so (they don’t) you now need several accounts scattered across the web to do so, and frankly that is too much work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cross-posting-vs-activitypub\">Cross Posting vs ActivityPub</h2>\n<p>Since reading Dave’s post, <a href=\"/2023/11/03/posse-has-it.html\" class=\"u-in-reply-to\">numerous retorts have sprung up</a>, with good arguments for and against the ideas in POSSE — and a few missing the point entirely and ranting about something else. I agree, there are plenty of nuances here. As above, I think the idea is sound and makes perfect sense, I just think there is too much onus on the person to do the running around and manage the services. You can’t treat a social network like an RSS feed that people subscribe to. I guess you can, but that sucks a bit, doesn’t it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/643de8aff5.jpg\" alt=\"Posting to your blog and syndicating everywhere else \"></p>\n<p>Social media is, and should be, a two-way street. Yes, there are bots, and if you <em>are</em> intending your POSSE to be one, then be explicit about it, but you should really be managing replies and comments on everywhere you post. Otherwise, it feels like <a href=\"/2022/01/17/social-media-ghosting.html\">social media ghosting</a>. As I wrote about in 2022, posting as if you are there, and then not checking in feels horrible. Micro.blog is still littered with people that put in their RSS feed years ago, so it appears as if they are posting, but they left a long time ago.</p>\n<p>This is where ActivityPub gets it right. This isn’t cross posting, it’s consuming the same post in several places. The replies are the same, and it doesn’t matter where they come from. The post I write on my blog, syndicates everywhere, it isn’t cross posting. My blog post <em>is</em> the Mastodon post (or wherever else works with ActivityPub), not a facsimile of it that I never see. I don’t have to go and check everywhere else it appears, I don’t even need an account anywhere else. My blog post is all that’s needed, and that is how it should be.</p>\n<p>Not everyone agrees, of course. <a href=\"https://micro.blog/manton\">Manton Reece</a>, who David interviewed for his POSSE post and <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-vergecast/id430333725?i=1000632256014\">subsequent podcast,</a> thinks your posts should be able to be consumed everywhere. That’s simply because we don&rsquo;t live in an ideal world where everything supports ActivityPub. It remains to be seen if <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/threads-adopting-activitypub-makes-sense-but-wont-be-easy/\">Meta will actually bring it into Threads</a>. So cross posting is all we have. It just requires some thought, and I am not convinced everyone needs to cross post everywhere. Unless you live off the clicks, it’s far too much work.</p>\n",

				"title": "New Journalling App In iOS17.2",
				"content_html": "<p>One of the big missing parts when <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a> launched, at least for me, was Apple&rsquo;s new journalling app. It’s something that I have been doing for <a href=\"/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html\">the past few months</a>, and it has proved a real benefit in numerous areas. Although I’m a happy <a href=\"/2017/12/20/journaling-with-day.html\">Day One subscriber</a>, having a free stock option is an excellent edition.</p>\n<p>It was conspicuous by its absence, and although <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/13/new-ios-17-features-coming-later-this-year/\">Apple eventually announced</a> it was coming “later this year” that didn’t really help. The app did not appear in any of the beta cycles nor the public iOS 17.1 release this week, but it <em>is</em> finally available for beta testers on 17.2. You can <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/journal/id6447391597\">view the app on the App Store</a>, but not download it without the needed software.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8c3de6ee97.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re expecting a fully featured Day One rival, you will be disappointed at the moment. The app is very bare bones with a minimalistic interface. Which does make it straightforward to add an entry and scroll through the entries you have made, which is the whole point of a journal. Remember this is beta software after all.</p>\n<p>When tapping the plus action button, you can choose between using AI-generated prompts to fuel your entry or to be greeted with a blank entry waiting for your thoughts. You can add in pictures, locations, and even voice notes, but there is a distinct lack of styling options. There is no way to add in subheadings, quotes, or anything other than basic text.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/42d0d2cc42.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If you were expecting to be able to treat the Journal app as you would a regular journal and place in all manner of things, currently you will be disappointed. Wherever you decide to add in an image doesn’t matter because they automatically jump to the top of the page and display in a square grid. This simple oversight, which I must stress could be improved as the beta cycle goes on, will put many journal users off. A Reddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/s/syn45BdQxj\">thread linking to the app</a> shares similar feeling towards the basic styling, lack of tagging or ability to have multiple journals.</p>\n<p>With that said, I think this is a great addition to iOS. Most users stick to using stock apps and if by launching this app Apple can get more people journalling it is worth it. If and when users want more features they can go looking for ‘better’ apps, but the simple titled Journal app is a great, if restrictive, starting point.</p>\n",

His analytics platform, the aptly named <a href=\"https://tinylytics.app/\">Tinylytics</a>, includes the ability to add a dopamine boating feedback mechanism right into your blog posts. I’ve made this the simple thumbs up emoji because I’m simple, however others have made it all sorts of things. See <a href=\"https://maique.eu/\">Maique blog</a> and the lollipop icon. This achieves the same thing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b32c691183.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Usually, the reserve of social media platforms, it’s actually quite nice to receive the occasional bit of feedback. A little nod to say people have read it and like it, rather than just bouncing off the page. I don’t think it should be the basis of why you publish to your blog, but thanks to Vincent’s work, it really helps. It is simple to set up, and you can try Tinylytics out for free at <a href=\"https://tinylytics.app/\">Tinylytics.app</a>. I’m not affiliated with the service whatsoever, I just think it’s cool and people asked about it.</p>\n",

That is that my life is pretty mundane and built on load sod routines. My life is not one that social media would find very fascinating, and certainly is not all sunshine and rainbows.</p>\n<p>This week, I have been preparing for my birthday and also numerous big projects coming up in my working life. Reflected by feeling as if this is the calm before the storm. I celebrate my 40th birthday (yes, I am <em>that</em> old) on Wednesday and before that, I have two days of kick off meetings. Oh, the joys! I hate my birthdays.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Watched two games of the greatest team the world has ever seen (Arsenal), both with amazing atmospheres and great goals.</li>\n<li>Celebrated my mother-in-law’s birthday with a visit of all the family to our house, which is where the photo above comes from. Too many kids to count and so much fun playing with their toys. Moments like this make me realise what a huge kid I still am at heart.</li>\n<li>Ran just under 10 miles for the first time in a long time on Saturday. Meaning my weekly milage is slowly creeping up. The main issues I have is running more than 2 or 3 times in a week, at which point my body starts to tell me off. It is a struggle, but it&rsquo;s worth it for a great cause – donate to <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024\">London For Lucie</a>.</li>\n<li>Received my iPhone 15 Pro max on Friday. I’ve gone up in size this time, and although I’m still not convinced, <a href=\"/2023/09/22/no-more-flat.html\">the curved sides</a> and Titanium build make it much easier to handle. The zoom lens seems a bit meh, though.</li>\n<li>I have been thinking a lot about blogging recently. Why someone would start and blog and the motivations to publish on the internet. A quote from Seth Godin stuck out to me, “ If you’re about to spend time and money and effort to create something, how will you know if it worked? What needs to happen to make it worth it?” The only external metrics you really have are clicks and responses, and it is up to you if you want to measure either of those things.</li>\n<li>I managed to leave the sunroof of my brand-new car open last weekend, and, of course, it rained. There were some choice words muttered to myself, but it’s being repaired and should be back with me shortly. Mistakes happen, I guess, but the stress could have been avoided. I know how to make the sunroof shut when I lock the car now!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"interesting-links\">Interesting Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/09/those-view-counts-on-x-tiktok-and-netflix-be-skeptical.html\">Lies, Damned Lies, and Social-Media Metrics – Those</a> view counts on Twitter, TikTok, and Netflix?

				"content_html": "<p>Before myself and Nati recorded the first episode of <a href=\"https://toppodcast.com/podcast_feeds/bring-your-own-device/\">bring your own device,</a> we made promises to each other. To be honest about everything. To be Apple fans, enjoy Apple devices but not be Apple apologists. To not be another voice in the sea of Apple bloggers that spent most of their time explaining why your opinions are wrong.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the podcast no longer exists, but that idea that was core to everything we talked about stuck with me. I’ve never shied away from calling out mistakes from Apple, and <a href=\"/2017/10/25/not-being-a.html\">tried very hard to not fall into fanboy traps</a>. This is an extremely long-winded way of setting up a way to say <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l28UAs30Jjk&amp;t=101s\">I was right</a> about the iPhone 12 design all along!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c28e0726d5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I made a (feeble) video about the design almost as soon as I felt it because I was amazed at the massive step back. I read in amazement all the words that were then written to defend it. Claiming that it was a brilliant design, and perhaps I was “holding it wrong” (again). There is nothing wrong with opposing opinions, and some people seemed to genuinely like the update, so I did question myself a little.</p>\n<p>However, the iPhone 15 smoothed out edges make me feel vindicated. Even more so when the same people telling everyone that the design was great, are now saying the iPhone 15 update is much better. There is absolutely no denying it. A combination of the curved edges, the titanium frame and the slightly slimmer bezels make the phone feel much smaller than it actually is.</p>\n<p>I’ve gone up to the max this year with zero regrets now this phone actually fits in my hand! My pinky would like to formally thank Apple designers for thinking about the shape of human hands.</p>\n",

Not that anyone cares but with all the excitement of Apple announcements it completely slipped my mind. So excuse the two week update of what I’ve been up to. Weirdly mostly tech related.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ordered the new iPhone 15 pro. This year I am moving up to the max because I’m old and want a bigger screen and this is now my only camera so I want the best one.</li>\n<li>Skipped the watch updates. Nothing beats my current Ultra and a processor bump will not make me part with another £850.</li>\n<li>Running just over 10k consistently now. My lungs are still and issue but mainly after my run. Please donate to <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024\">London for Lucie</a>.</li>\n<li>Happy to have Matt Birchler on board with the stock <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7KMYKoDiIiU?si=hWB7S0-IsOaFVlsh\">Apple podcast app</a>. Nothing works as well over several Apple devices and although it’s not perfect the iOS17 beta makes it even better.</li>\n<li>My son may be disappearing to Spain for a week next year as part of a school event. Super proud of his dedication to his school work and being an awesome human being.</li>\n<li>Everyone is back at work now and the house is quiet all week while I work from home. Almost makes me want to visit the office. Almost.</li>\n<li>I bought and returned a Pixel fold last week. It’s just <a href=\"/2023/09/11/its-not-for.html\">not for me</a> in the slightest. A poor phone and an even worse table rolled into on very nice but lacking device.</li>\n<li>We have lots of hospital appointments coming up so this week will be a busy one. All of Lucie appointments come around at once and it always sucks. Hopefully I don’t forget to write stuff.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Continue to be awesome, and that’s an order but make sure you take it very easy my friends.</p>\n<p>🤙</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I read a recent <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/i-tried-to-use-apples-calendar-app-but-i-ran-back-to-fantastical/\">post by Matt Birchler</a> talking about his experiment with going back to Apple’s stock calendar. It sparked in me thoughts about my recent switch (well a few months ago) and I thought I would share my experiences. Not that my lowly blog needs to lend credence to the amazing Matt Birchler, but it is often helpful to see more than one person pointing to the same things.</p>\n<p>With that said, Matt and I have very similar jobs. One full of meetings, team catch-ups and projects to complete. I am sure he also has a fair share of family things to keep up with too, and I have all sorts of appointments and meeting for <a href=\"/2022/08/03/lucie-loves-her.html\">my daughter</a> to contend with. So the benefits felt by perhaps one side of life for some people very much bleed into every part of mine.</p>\n<p>For me, my calendar is my entire life and <a href=\"/2019/11/20/how-i-use.html\">has been for some time</a>. When people turn their noses up at a subscription for “just a calendar app” I do understand. However, I get so much value from Fantastical, it is money I gladly hand over. You see, I <em>could</em> (and have) get by with the stock app, but I’m much better off with Fantastical. You might ask why, and that’s why you’re reading this post, so let me try to break it down for you without being too repetitive.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/22a9c87b11.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"meetings-and-integrations\">Meetings And Integrations</h2>\n<p>The pandemic accelerated my already increasing number of virtual meetings. Something I don’t really mind because I’d rather be working from home than traveling all over the place. For some reason, every company seems to use a different method for these, so I have to meet with SEO experts on Google meet, internal conversations on Teams and then move to chatting with event organisers on Zoom. Fantastical makes this a breeze. I don’t need to install loads of apps all over the place, just sign in with all of my accounts and click the join meeting button in my calendar.</p>\n<p>Fantastical also integrates with my task manager of choice, Todoist, as well as my Office 365 work calendar, my shared iCloud calendar with my wife and even Meet Up for some sudo socialising! By having everything in one place, I can see all of my tasks scattered across the various platforms all in one full list. Not many apps allow numerous services to be integrated and work together as if they were all in the same place. This works on mobile too by selecting tasks in the top left menu.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8f102193a5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"time-boxing\">Time Boxing</h2>\n<p>Which leads me to my next major feeling point for Fantastical, time boxing is life changing. I first noticed this with Josh Ginter <a href=\"https://thesweetsetup.com/fantasticals-duplicate-as-event-has-changed-my-time-blocking-routine/\">writing about this for Sweet Set Up</a>, and it was the thing that inspired me to go all in on a better calendar app. As you can see from my screenshots, I block out time in my calendar to complete certain types of tasks all at once. Placing DND into areas that I don’t want to be disturbed – but I can do that in any calendar app Greg, I hear you say. Indeed, you can, but the customised colours and <a href=\"https://flexibits.com/blog/2021/01/getting-started-with-templates/\">templates you can set up</a> make this easy to set up and understand with a glance.</p>\n<p>This is where two things come into play and make time boxing effortless for me when using Fantastical. I can look at the upcoming weeks calendar and already all tasks with due dates are present. I can then begin to plan around them, blocking out my day to make sure I know how much spare time I have and what kind of tasks will dominate those days. Pressing CMD + R brings up a list of all the tasks I have outstanding, and I can simply drag these into the places that I have blocked out. For example, above are periods where I have blocked out designing time, and in this 4–5 hours I can get several design focused tasks completed.</p>\n<p>Granted, I understand that these things might not make a difference to you. To be honest, there was a long time when I thought they didn’t for me, and now I couldn’t be without it. Fantastical saves me more than the cost of the subscription in time and effort, but I understand it is not for everyone.</p>\n",

It’s a known human cognitive bias, the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon, I know it’s false, but I am experiencing it with vertical things at the minute and I can’t work out where it is going.</p>\n<p>It started on Saturday when I was running (donate to <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024\">London For Lucie</a> by the way!) and listening to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/1/23855476/today-on-the-vergecast-happy-techtember-everybody\">The Vergecast</a>. In which they were talking about all video apps being the same, just consuming each other’s ideas and increasing the length of vertical video viewable in apps. Which is interesting considering, as they point out, a service like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quibi\">Quibi</a>, despite it terrible name, might not have been the worst idea ever. An idea explored in <a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/the-big-flop/episode/13847-quibi-bites-the-dust-with-connor-ratliff-amp-matt-bellassai/\">episode 1 of The Big Flop</a>. Smartphone users really like vertical videos, and it feels much more natural.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b17e17aed9.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Image from Kapwig\"></p>\n<p>This started a flash back to weird marketing events I have been to where people have discussed vertical video and very much switched off (I hate those type of events). I began to wonder just how much do people prefer watching vertical videos because it does make a lot of sense for many situations, but everything bar the smartphone sticks to horizontal. Of course, you can find stats <a href=\"https://www.animaker.com/blog/vertical-video-facebook-ads-case-study/\">all</a> <a href=\"https://www.aarki.com/blog/driving-higher-engagement-with-vertical-video\">over</a> <a href=\"https://www.impactplus.com/blog/vertical-video-in-marketing-infographic\">the</a> <a href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/vertical-video/\">place</a>, but turns out – it’s a lot.</p>\n<p>Still seems odd to me outside of quick scrolling social media, but I’m not one to argue with the stats and considering how old I am, my opinions could just be the old guy shouting at the clouds again. It just made me think back to a few years ago when any person filming vertical video would have been chastised. Now it is not only the norm, but it is expected. This also got me questioning many things.</p>\n<p>There’s new <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/lifestyle-tvs/the-sero/\">TV’s with vertical modes</a>, <a href=\"https://ergomounts.co.uk/product/infinity-series-vertical-tv-floor-stand/\">floor stands to make yours do it</a>, and all sorts of products pushing vertical monitors. It seems absurd at first, but when you stop and think about it, it makes a lot of sense. I’m a bit stuck with a reason on actual TVs, but websites, apps and almost any user interface I come across has the majority of its elements in a vertical stack. This got me thinking about my work, mainly being in web UI and Print design (which is nearly all vertical). I had side eyed the oddly shaped LG DualUp when it was first launched, thinking it made sense at the time – so I bought one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/74088e7469.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It was relatively cheap in the world on monitors, and comes with a really nice ergonomic arm, so I feel like I got a good deal. However, as soon as I placed it down on my desk (well, clamped it to it) I felt conflicted. As much as the size and orientation makes sense, it just feels strange. That all went away when using it, though. The build quality, screen resolution and portrait set up means I am over the moon with it. Why on earth I didn’t pull the rigger before I will never know, maybe I have been indoctrinated by the previous landscape based world. However, now I am free!</p>\n",

I am certain that some weeks have been even worse, but seeing it so easily makes me want to get my ass into gear and publish more. Perhaps you will see more before next week&rsquo;s post? Don’t hold your breath!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If I can be allowed to start at the end of the week and work backwards, I watched Arsenal destroy Man United yesterday and there are not many better feelings than this. Watching it with my brother-in-law who is a United fan made it even sweeter.</li>\n<li>Yesterday I deleted my Instagram account. It became too much of a time suck and fed my ego to a point where I took a break for a week or so. This finally made me realise how little I need it in my life, and <a href=\"/2023/09/03/logged-in-to.html\">the final straw</a> was on checking in on Thread I wasn’t allowed to disable my account again for a week. So, instead, it has been deleted – don’t look for me there.</li>\n<li>This week was my best week for a long time running. I racked up 35 miles all told. I realise this isn’t a long way, but it is a gigantic boost to me, and my lungs are starting to feel much better. I have months of training to go, but I am starting to believe I can do it. Donate to London for Lucie <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>I took delivery of a new monitor for my home working office. It is the <a href=\"https://www.lg.com/uk/monitors/ergo-monitors/28mq780-b/\">LG DualUp – which</a> is taking some getting used to. The monitor itself is portrait rather than landscape and has great reviews online. I work mostly in print work, and websites, both of which are portrait, so this should work better than a wider monitor or another one on the side.</li>\n<li>Someone is working very hard this week to break into my Facebook account. I mean, I don’t even really have one apart from a blank shell to manage my business pages, but I get 3-4 password reset emails a day. It’s fun.</li>\n<li>We also attended a friend&rsquo;s christening, which was really fun. Meeting with our group of friends and spending time laughing and joking was great. Lucie thoroughly enjoyed walking around because she knows everyone and believe me, everyone knows her!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would rather not mention my flip phone adventures, it is for another time, so you will have to stay tuned. I will always be here and pretty much nowhere else now. Take care of yourselves, have a wonderful week.</p>\n<p>🤙</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e00dfadb12.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I am sure he will forgive me, but I always read <a href=\"https://maique.eu/2023/08/28/thingsthisweek.html\">thingsThisWeek</a> by Maique and like the idea of small updates of the things I have been up to. So without further fuss, here’s mine.</p>\n<p>This week was ups and downs as usual. Filled full of some working and some days off due to bank holidays and skilfully timed annual leave. I spent a lot of it trying to relax, failing, and also trying to <a href=\"/2023/08/19/trying-to-get.html\">run a little more</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yesterday we went to meet another little girl with the same genetic condition as Lucie. It’s wonderful to think that something so rare, about 50 people have it worldwide, can affect two little girls just down the road from each other.</li>\n<li>I have been a bit slack on some of my important routines over the summer holidays. For example, journalling and meditating. I discovered I can <a href=\"https://todoist.com/integrations/apps/habit-tracker\">track habits in Todoist</a> so set this up for a few essential ones with reminders. It is working well.</li>\n<li>On the Todoist front, I have been leaning on more digital tools recently. I wrote about my <a href=\"/2023/08/26/notebooks-in-summer.html\">summer issues with carrying a notebook</a>, but even with digital tools I have tried to bring over good analogue habits.</li>\n<li>This week, I have spent some time thinking about what I want my blog to be and working on some theme updates. With this in mind, I have set up <a href=\"https://tinylytics.app/\">tinylytics</a>, the excellent service from <a href=\"https://vincentritter.com/?ts=gr36\">Vincent</a>, just for the ‘like’ button. You will notice an improved comment and reply section below.</li>\n<li>My running is going slightly better this week than last. I’ve been slowly plodding around some miles. I still feel like I might have to give up at any moment, but the great charity I am doing it for keeps me going. I’d love it if you would donate <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Had to take a bit of a break from all social media after American politics reared its ugly head again. It seems to have calmed down a bit again, so I’m checking in every so often – but mostly publishing without visiting anything.</li>\n<li>I’ve got plenty of thoughts about my <a href=\"/2023/08/23/my-big-flip.html\">use of a flip hone again</a>. I need to get around to writing these up, but every time I try it becomes really preachy, and I would rather not publish that. Safe to say my mind feels a bit better, but I have relented and wearing my Apple Watch again. I’m not certain how, but it still gives me Todoist notifications and the like, but it’s mainly for tracking runs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope you all have a great week this week, and you know where I am if you need me. 🤙</p>\n",

For the next 4 weeks, at least, I will be back to using a flip phone, so I figured I might as well get some blog posts (and entertainment) out of it while I navigate this weirdness.</p>\n<p>A week or so ago, I was doing the yearly practice of <a href=\"/2023/08/15/its-that-time.html\">trying to work out when</a> the new iPhone should come out, and when the best time to sell my current version would be. It’s a fine line between having to use a backup phone for a while and getting the most for a device that will drop in price the closer to the iPhone event we get. I usually go back to using my trusty first generation iPhone SE for a week or so, and by the end of it I am ready to throw it in the bin. This year, my SE has not risen from the ashes, and so I’ve opted for something more radical.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/38056de2d4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Listen, I’ve been banging on about hating my phone but needing to use it for ages, but never done anything drastic before. I’m uncertain if it is because <a href=\"/2023/08/23/currently-reading-stolen.html\" title=\"5:21 pm\">I’m reading Stolen Focus by Johann Hart</a> presently, or I’m just getting my yearly internet annoyance period. Whatever the motivation for it is, my SIM card is now in a Nokia 2660 Flip phone that cost me a whole £25. Well, actually two of them are, my work phone and my personal number because this phone is Dual sim (and that’s about the only useful thing about it).</p>\n<p>In the first few hours, I’ve already had a panic because I couldn’t check how much money was in my bank account before I made a purchase. I’ve also been teased relentlessly by my wife and son for daring to take a call in public on it, but I think I am getting there. I will no doubt hit numerous road blocks along the way, and might end up stomping into town to buy a cheap iPhone, but it will be amusing for everyone to watch (or read about) anyway.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>As most people will already be aware, I’m <a href=\"/2023/08/02/london-for-lucie.html\">running the London Marathon</a> to raise funds for the Epilepsy Society. A charity very close to my heart. Although the run isn’t until April 2024, I need to start ramping up my running in preparation and unfortunately, this is proving more difficult than I thought.</p>\n<p>In December 2021, I got my third COVID-19 vaccine, the so-called winter booster. This started one of the biggest issues I’ve had to overcome in my life because it threw my life into chaos. I’d not experienced any side effects to the other two shots, but immediately following this one I didn’t feel myself and still don’t. After a few weeks of suffering, I discovered I had issues with my heart and lungs, leaving me unable to even walk very far without feeling out of breath.</p>\n<p>This was devastating to me. I’ve always been active, <a href=\"/2021/03/09/i-did-it.html\">raising money for charity</a> and running was <a href=\"/2021/02/15/why-do-i.html\">one of my favourite</a> things to do. The inability to do much affected my mental health and my family, and that still continues to this day. Although I am much better than I have been, running and placing too much stress on my system has been frustrating.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/acfb82c727.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I thought that these issues were starting to wear off, but as soon as I’ve tried to run again, doing anything but a mild pace results in my lungs hating me for days afterwards. So I’m trying to take this really slow and steady, but I think the pace I used to run at is ingrained in my legs.</p>\n<p>I’m aiming to run the 26.2 miles in around 4:30, which is slow but a pace achievable for me. This is a little over 10 minute miles or 6:23 kilometres. My plan was to start off at this pace and increase my mileage very slowly over time. Yet, trying to slow myself down for my bodies sake, takes too much concentration at the minute. Any time I try to switch off and enjoy the run, my legs start speeding up again!</p>\n<div class=\"london box\">\n<h2>Donate to London For Lucie</h2></a>\n</div>\n<p>Within a few minutes, I realise I’m going too fast because my lungs are telling me off and I have to slow down again. It’s a ridiculous problem to have, and one that results in me running around a minute per km too fast. This has also put some stress on my body that I didn’t want, and my breathing is suffering at the minute. There is no question about me keeping going, but I may have underestimated the effort needed. As well, as its effects on the rest of my life.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Like Cobra Kai, the life cycle of talking about Really Simple Syndication feeds never dies. Since reaching 2.0 thanks to the development group that included Aaron Swartz, RSS has become one of the backbones of the internet. Web silos can try all they like to shut it down and control everything, but it continues to deliver everything from your favourite podcasts to the best websites directly to your proverbial door.</p>\n<p>Despite being a massive proponent of RSS, I have been fighting with it for a while. Using other services seemingly built on top of it to suite me better, but nothing beats simply subscribing to your favourite feeds in a simple app of your choice. I am back to doing exactly that because of issues, bugs and perhaps web silos – I simply can’t find anything better.</p>\n<p>Listen. Matter has given it a good go and <a href=\"/2022/12/14/matter-my-most.html\">I thoroughly enjoy using it</a>. So much so that I paid for a <a href=\"/2023/05/15/received-some-gifts.html\">Patron subscription</a>, including three years of access and priority support. Building several shortcuts and reading workflows to share highlights to my blog and annotate interesting articles. Since before <a href=\"https://hq.getmatter.com/nucleus\">their own 2.0 version</a>, I’ve been using it to subscribe to much of the web through RSS and delivering newsletters to it. However, it just doesn’t cut it any more.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9fa45b5b0e.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>See the screenshots above, I am subscribed to <a href=\"https://birchtree.me\">Matt Birchler’s blog</a> feed in both Matter and Reeder 5. These should be the same, yet there’s a stark difference with what is available for me to read. Despite flagging feeds all the time because I know there are posts missing, nothing ever changes. I realise that Matter does numerous fancy things by parsing all the web content etc, but this is more of a realisation that regular old RSS is best.</p>\n<p>In a search to find a replacement, I went on a tour of all the services I could find or came recommended. Many built on top of RSS. Some offered seemingly extortionate ‘Pro’ subscriptions for finding new RSS feeds for you (yet only sticking to well-known websites). Even more of them offered me some kind of assistant to summarise the articles for me. Among all the investigation, I discovered something different – like my note-taking, <a href=\"/2023/03/03/the-simplest-path.html\">the simplest path</a> is the best.</p>\n<p>If you want to build some fancy second brain and map your thoughts, or write notes until your fingers are numb, there’s a service out there for you. Yet, the two decade old idea of just subscribing to the RSS feed is often the way to go.</p>\n",

I have been trying and failing to enter the London Marathon for years, but that doesn’t change the fact that it will be a huge challenge for me.

				"content_html": "<p>When rumours started to appear that Meta, of all companies, were working on an ActivityPub based social network, I was sceptical. I’m a massive fan of the protocol since retreating to <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">micro.blog</a> as my only social interaction in the middle of last year. Meta putting its stamp on some IndieWeb underpinnings could mean so much for networks such as Mastodon, and could mean that social media companies were finally being more open.</p>\n<p>This is just something companies say. Marketing spin to ride on the coat tails of the hype surrounding the influx of Mastodon users, and wouldn’t actually be the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754304/instagram-meta-twitter-competitor-threads-activitypub\">case come launch day</a>. If Meta really wanted to do something like this, surely they would put it into established apps like Instagram first. It was a confusing proposition to have this huge ad company, used to locking everything down and maximising eyeball time, adopt anything open. I didn’t buy it.</p>\n<p>Months later, <a href=\"/2023/07/09/my-lukewarm-take.html\">Threads appears</a> in a rush, following a few weeks of drama on some Mastodon servers calling for de-federation. Surprise, surprise, with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/adam-mosseri-says-metas-threads-app-wont-have-activitypub-support-at-launch/\">no ActivityPub support</a> – but Meta does seem <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/169559812696339\">invested in implementation</a>. There are still some doubts, that have grown following Threads mass adoption, but the conversation by Casey Newton and Instagrams head Adam Mosseri on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/podcasts/special-episode-metas-twitter-rival-arrives-with-adam-mosseri.html\">Hard Fork</a> convinces me that ActivityPub is in their near future.</p>\n<p>By making it easy to follow other ActivityPub accounts, they not only open the service up to more users and more content. They also make it easer to move elsewhere. That’s a huge advantage to someone like me who plans to retreat to his <a href=\"\">ActivityPub blog</a> once all the fuss is over, but also for every other user. Don’t like the way Threads is run, get tired of the algorithm thirst trap, or just want to expand your brand further? That&rsquo;s easy with ActivityPub. You can move to a different server and <em>still</em> access all the content being posted on Threads.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/daf438108d.jpg\" alt=\"Image from Private Internet Access \" title=\"Image from Private Internet Access  \"></p>\n<p>I am not naive enough to think this is for completely altruistic purposes. The cynic in me can point to numerous advantages to Meta for seeming to embrace an open standard. Account portability means that any negative press or possible legal action over algorithmic feeds and so-called shadow-banning can be combatted with the fact users can move. There&rsquo;s no argument against ‘de-platforming’ someone, as ActivityPub makes it easy to pack up your account and leave.</p>\n<p>Meta also has the opportunity to turn Threads into what <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/7/23787093/on-the-vergecast-its-threads-all-the-way-down\">The Verge referred to as the blue bubble of ActivityPub</a>. You can build on top of the standard, allowing your specific service to have extra features, but also syndicate everywhere else. Making Threads more attractive to people seeking those features, perhaps such as deep integration with Instagram, but not being restrictive. The downside of this, of course, is that you can only show ads to <em>your</em> users, but that might mean Meta has to work on providing a platform people want.</p>\n<p>Whatever the motivation behind ActivityPub, it doesn’t negate the fact that openness is solving big issues for social media platforms. ActivityPub&rsquo;s integration is best for both parties and solves massive issues, and does it well. Being able to move your content from platform to platform is the dream of an open web, and if that works out best for indie blogs and social media corporations at the same time, that&rsquo;s great for everyone.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Meta rushed out its Twitter competitor come rip off due to the current rate limit disaster going on over there, and everyone rushed to try it out. The combination of a vast number of people using it, increased moderation efforts and hype around ActivityPub integration met in a perfect storm of interest that meant tens of millions of users flooded in. I was one of them that jumped on the Zuck bandwagon, and I’ve got some conflicting thoughts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"initial-impressions\">Initial Impressions</h2>\n<p>I downloaded that app when it was launched. In fact, I was that sad I pre-ordered the app a couple of days before. Not because I was excited, but I was pretty intrigued to try it out, as I do with most new apps with significant hype around it. I don’t really want to get involved with a Twitter replacement, but I enjoy kicking the tyres on most things just to see what they offer.</p>\n<p>Only a matter of minutes after porting <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_greg_morris/\">my Instagram account</a> data into Threads, I was deactivating it and deleting the apps. The homescreen was filled with clout chasing ‘influencers’ spouting all kind of drivel that <a href=\"/2023/07/06/sign-into-threads.html\">really wasn’t what I needed</a> in my life at this point. I had escaped one hell site that I was moderately addicted to, and just the thought of using Threads gave me horrible flashbacks. For a few hours, anyway. I read some posts, listened to some thoughts and a few messages exchanged with other people using Threads, I logged back in again.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2914c98528.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In my haste to get away from the service, I had unwittingly <a href=\"/2023/07/06/fyi-you-cant.html\">deactivated my Instagram account too.</a> Meta are unable to untie the two once you’ve signed up (something they claim to be <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/07/delete-your-threads-account/\">working on a fix</a> for). So, I am actually thankful I logged in again. This time around I followed a few more people and began to realise the benefits of the service. Don’t get me wrong, the thirst trap algorithms are still turned up to 11, and I hate it, but there is a benefit to having many people you want to follow in one place. Threads mixes my worlds together with Photographers from Instagram, tech people that never Twitter and also friends that never ‘got’ Twitter but were pushed toward Threads from Instagram.</p>\n<h2 id=\"half-baked\">Half Baked</h2>\n<p>Reporting suggests that Threads was rushed out at least a couple of weeks before it was ready, and even at that point I think it would have been an MVP. Meta has thought about the important things such as muting and blocking, but the edges of the service are more than a little rough. Including the inability to attach photos without the app crashing. Something initially blamed on iOS17 betas, but is also plaguing Android users.</p>\n<p>It is hard to know if the terrible experience on the main feed is to combat a lack of content and users (usually referred to as a cold start). I hope that it will be turned down once the user base is high enough. However, it is quintessentially Instagram in the sense that it shows you people you follow first and then quickly ramps up the influencers posts. The app takes on the annoying approach of showing you a glimpse of an interesting post that then disappears once the app loads, never to be seen of again.</p>\n<p>Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri says that a <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/06/threads-feed-of-people-you-follow/\">chronological feed is “on the list”</a> but how long that list is who knows. Given the app&rsquo;s tendency to not only crash but log you out in the process, and the lack of any web app, I would say that list is pretty long.</p>\n<h2 id=\"will-i-use-it\">Will I Use It?</h2>\n<p>I absolutely hate this idea that platforms are only as valuable as the traffic they provide but it is true most of the time. Users flocked to Twitter because it was the place to be, provided up-to-the-minute news, and for publishers it provided access like never before. All of a sudden, you could see what people were up to, and at the same time drive traffic to whatever it was that you were producing. Rapidly working its way into journalists&rsquo; lives, as well as publishers bottom lines.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4d84bad5b2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The same could be said about Instagram. It provides access to even more people of note, albeit through an airbrushed and filtered lens. Users can show off their best life, showcase their work and influence the purchasing decisions of more than a billion people. What Meta are really good at is recognising this and maximising the results in their favour. They don’t care what you post, only that you are posting and consuming as much as possible. It is social media manipulation in the most obvious sense – and I hate that.</p>\n<p>Threads is also a pretty nice place to be. If you can mentally filter out all the noise, that hopefully will die down in a few days. Currently it feels as if we have all realised that Twitter was wrong on so many levels and want Threads to be a nicer place to be. I have no doubt that tools, dunking on people and attention seeking will come, but Instagram have promised that their moderation efforts are aimed to make Threads a pleasant place to be. However, Meta doesn&rsquo;t exactly have the best track record and may already be <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/threads-moderation-nudity-lgbtq-users\">hitting issues</a>.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I am conflicted. I know in my heart of hearts that using a product by Meta is the worst social media decision. Even if it appears that Meta is the better of two evils, it is still evil and nothing can change my mind on that given their history. However, I am actually enjoying being able to interact with more people again. I am catching up with people that I haven’t followed for a very long time, and that is great. I see myself diving in a little until Threads <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/adam-mosseri-says-metas-threads-app-wont-have-activitypub-support-at-launch/\">introduces ActivityPub</a> – at which point I will probably divert everything back to my blog.</p>\n<p>I am excited for a time when I can take part in the discussions happening on Threads, but not have to use the service or their terrible app. Let’s hope this doesn’t take too long but I have a feeling it might not be this year.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>One of the biggest complaints I had at the time I chose to <a href=\"/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html\">remove the iPad from my workflow</a> was the constantly changing nature of it. Each time Apple updated the OS they slightly changed, or completely revamped, the way multitasking and other things worked. When you use and rely on something as much as I did my iPad, it gets frustrating quickly. Unfortunately, they have now done it to the Apple Watch, and I’m pulling out what little hair I have.</p>\n<p>I am aware it beta software, so everything <strong>could</strong> change, but watchOS 10 changes the core functionality so much that I doubt it will all of a sudden roll back these changes. This isn’t uncommon for Apple either, way back in 2017, I was frustrated at the <a href=\"/2017/12/05/what-does-a.html\">inconsistency on what a swipe does</a> on different iPhones. Now it is my muscle memory that has been forged by many years of having these things strapped to my wrist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/de570fbb6b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I don’t even dislike the update, a lot of it makes sense, it’s more of the jarring UX change. I keep swiping up from the bottom of the screen, something I have done thousands of times to access Control Center, and it now shows me widgets. Widgets that, excuse me for being an old man shouting at clouds for a moment, I have absolutely no need of!</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"/2015/05/17/i-like-this.html\">fell in love with the Apple Watch</a>, much like I did the iPad because it was simple. It did exactly what I required. Told the time and gave me the health tracking needed. Now I just feel a little out of touch, as if it is watchOS 1 and Apple thinks I am going to send my heartbeat to other people again. I hope that watch OS doesn’t suffer the same fate as iPad OS and forget exactly what it is, and how simple it should be.</p>\n<p>Accessing the dock of apps is now double press the crown, and turning it also accesses the aforementioned widgets. I like change, I love change for a reason, but this feels like change for change’s sake. The new animations do look nice though!</p>\n",

				"title": "Apple Notes Is Just About Perfect in iOS17",
				"content_html": "<p>It is pushing on for a year since I <a href=\"/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html\">wrote about my all in use of Apple notes</a>. That was about a year into my journey that started with numerous moving backwards and forwards in note apps, and ended with the realisation that the app that was built ring into my phone was the best one. It was the one I used the most, the one I relied on, and the one that delivered the most consistent experience. With iOS 17, the app is just about perfect for my use, and I bet that would be the case for most people.</p>\n<p>Listen, I love my <a href=\"/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html\">notebooks</a>, I carry them everywhere and love writing in them – but nothing beats digital notes for surfacing things. My Field notes is my inbox of sorts, it contains all the mess and fleeting things that come to mind (as well as all my scribbles). My enjoyment of them is purely tactile, and I fully understand that digital notes can be far more useful to keep, so I exist in this wonderful word of writing notes and then typing the important things into Apple Notes.</p>\n<p>I digress slightly, but I guess this gives you a good understanding of where the thoughts contained in the post come from. I have never been convinced that Apple notes was ‘perfect’, it was just the best option for me and most people. It lacked some simple things such as block quotes, and even making links on iOS was overly complicated, but iOS17 solves most of these little faults, and now it’s mostly perfect.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/efe904a390.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The biggest update to Apple Notes is linking between notes easily, and it’s not an exaggeration to say Apple absolutely nailed the implementation. You can tap link and just type out the name of the note you want to link to, there&rsquo;s no double bracket or back linking bandwagon joining, it’s simple, elegant and exactly what is needed. You’re not going to start a full PKM with Apple notes, but I would make the argument if you really need to anyway.</p>\n<p>Couple this with improvements to not only the styling options (hurray for block quotes) and also the easy you can do these, makes Apple Notes a serious note app for almost everyone. I had started writing most of my notes into Bear Notes until updating to the iOS17 beta and seeing most of my issues solved. It doesn’t have as many customisation and export options, but most of this can be solved with Shortcuts if that&rsquo;s your thing.</p>\n<p>After about 3 weeks of use, the app is fast, fluid and provides one of the best stock notes apps I have seen. I&rsquo;m as shocked as you are that Apple actually cares about its apps, once iOS17 comes out you should try it out.</p>\n",

				"title": "Apple's Vision Of Our Apocalypse",
				"content_html": "<p>When I sat down to watch this year&rsquo;s WWDC, Yes I am that sad it’s a bit of an event I sat down to specifically watch, I was already expecting the worst. Very few details had leaked about exciting updates to iOS or macOS, but there were leaks aplenty about the upcoming headset. I don’t like <a href=\"/2016/10/10/please-dont-put.html\">computers on peoples faces</a>, and Apple did nothing to persuade me otherwise.</p>\n<p>What it did do is create a buzz around VR again, and make sure that Apple <a href=\"/2023/05/06/the-apple-vr.html\">didn’t miss the boat</a>. Both technologically and conceptually, the Vision Pro is already a success for Apple. I have no doubt that the device, even one that <em>starts</em> at $3,500, will be amazingly built. Containing numerous advancements and more than one breakthrough technologies. Yet in my heart of heart, I am conflicted by this device.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/90c66f9207.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The overly airbrushed demos showed a world that simply doesn’t exist. Without mentioning that most of the videos appeared to be CGI, the concept Apple tried to create missed entirely. Whilst I expected the Vision Pro to be marketed heavily to creatives, the ability to interact with a massive screen anywhere you like is appealing, I didn&rsquo;t expect the Black Mirroresque dystopian predictions. The vision of eyes displayed on a screen, so people know you can see them, genuinely made me shudder.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I was also blown away by the device. The same dread filled eyes are a hint that Apple has thought about users being in a world of their own, and also the wider issue of people around you knowing they can be seen. This is Apple business 101, wait and see where a market leads to and then produce a device with its users in mind. Once it goes on sale, there will be no questions about the way the device works or that it delivers on the promises made.</p>\n<p>Perhaps some of my worry comes from the rousing blog posts and YouTube videos crowing about how good it will be. There&rsquo;s far too much tech bro web3 weirdness going on for my liking. Anyone that expresses concern or, god forbid, thinks the whole thing is a bit silly, is met with “you just don’t get it” type replies. I do get it, I thoroughly understand the device, the promise of spacial computing, I just weep a little for the world it <em>might</em> create.</p>\n<p>I say might because I am just not convinced that the world conforms to Apple&rsquo;s make believe world. I’ve never done half of what Apple seems to think people do with their devices, and I can&rsquo;t see a world where people put massive goggles on to watch a film, at home, alone. Sure, it gives you a much more immersive experience where you can drown out everything around you, but is that <em>really</em> what is missing from our lives. Perhaps it is, and I am just an old man shouting at the clouds.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6489cb8e29.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The thing about my strange melancholic feelings about the Vision Pro is the unshakeable feeling that maybe I am wrong. Perhaps people will strap something on their face to watch films, or record the world around them, or entertain themselves on a plane journey – and I am just a bit sad about that. Charlie Warzel summed this up perfectly when talking about the Vision Pro being the perfect device for the Apocalypse. He wrote “a future in which people with enough disposable income can retreat from the physical world into the gated-face community of a 360-degree iPhone screen” and it scared me.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no preaching here. I use my devices to death, despite <a href=\"/2020/08/09/i-cant-go.html\">my desire not too</a>, so I am not on the outside looking in. More on the inside looking out, desiring a simpler world with less intrusion and distraction but accepting that the world is not mine to mould. I could see the advantage of something like Google Glass, that overlayed information onto your world. Perhaps even Snapchat Glasses or Facebooks Ray-bans for being device free. To a certain point, I can also see the benefits of the Vision Pro for some demos Apple used, such as working on a large screen in the office, but the rest of it is just weird.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ebf56e5ccb.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>For the first time in a long time, we are introduced to a new computing world. I genuinely understand the excitement that I see in the tech world around me. I get it. You are not wrong to feel that way. I just think it&rsquo;s been over sold and there will be many people who feel some very strange emotions after buying this device, and not just from the motion sickness.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>In modern times we have grown to rely on them, but starting with the first device to run them we’ve had a strange relationship to apps. No more so in the world of iOS, that for many years clung so rigidly it the ‘tap square, open app’ mentality that every single facet was sandboxed away from the other. A strange way to deal with things given that our whole lives are now on smart devices. Perhaps with iOS17, we are finally seeing what applications should have been from the start.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing. Apple’s approach was the best approach when devices were tiny, underpowered in both processing and battery departments, devices that were more of a novelty. In a world where <a href=\"https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world#:~:text=How%20Many%20People%20Have%20Smartphones%20In%20The%20World%3F&amp;text=According%20to%20Statista%2C%20in%202023,world%27s%20population%20owns%20a%20smartphone.\">6.92 billion people</a> rely on a smartphone, it starts to get a little silly. Why doesn’t my calendar app talk to my to-do app? Why doesn’t my sometimes smart voice assistant add content to my app of choice without vocal gymnastics? It&rsquo;s time to reconsider what an app is?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2a7bcb1350.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The latest iteration of iOS, version 17, scheduled to roll out to users in September, introduces interactive widgets. A large advancement on the idea that apps shouldn’t just exist behind squares on your homescreen. Or app library, or whatever it’s called this update. You should, in fact, be able to interact with the features of an app outside the confines Apple usually places on them – it is almost as if they get it now.</p>\n<p>Once I choose to install an app on my device, it should be able to interact with my device in whatever way I see fit. My device shouldn’t be set up to work with some apps better than others, or dictate to me what apps I have to have on my phone. If I ask Siri to remind me of a task, it should put that task in whatever app I want it to. Instead of jumping through all the linguistic hoops I have to currently. Anyone who has asked a simple command like “Remind me to call John tomorrow at 5pm in Todoist” knows that no-one in their right mind pronounces it Tod-oh-ist.</p>\n<p>Apple, and any smart device maker for that matter, needs to stop forcing things on me that I don’t want and listen to what I do want. Perhaps I want to use <a href=\"/2022/12/31/manual-practices-to.html\">Todoist</a> as my reminders app, <a href=\"/2019/12/03/i-keep-coming.html\">Bear</a> as my notes app, and WhatsApp as my text and video call app. iOS should get out of my way and allow me to do so, with the relevant checks for privacy and data access, of course. What’s the point in taking all of these wonderful applications that I can install on my phone and hiding them away behind an icon, an app should be part of my phone and the way I use it.</p>\n",

				"title": "Notes And Reminders Improvements in iOS17",
				"content_html": "<p>It seems like the WWDC keynote was only yesterday. Well, it was, but I’ve been playing with iOS17 ever since, and found numerous little things that were not spoken about in the keynote, so I thought I’d point them out here. Also, I need to sleep now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notes\">Notes</h2>\n<p>Listen, <a href=\"/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html\">I love Apple notes</a>, but there are a few things that are lacking to make it great. Unfortunately, Apple never seemed interested in its stock apps until the last few updates, and Notes once again gets quite a few teaks in iOS17.</p>\n<p>They spoke about PDFs and improvements to mark up, but Apple Notes also features the ability to link notes together. It’s not quite the double square bracket easy linking that modern notes apps seem to love, but it helps bring some PKM style linking to the best notes app on your iPhone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/480d42ee3a.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Also improved is the ease of selecting styling options, with everything available under a floating add button. I’d like to see adding a link available here too because using the text selection options is a little awkward, but at least things like indenting and font styling are easier to get to. There’s even less reason to <a href=\"/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html\">use anything else</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d8b343bf0b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"reminders\">Reminders</h2>\n<p>Apple mentioned interactive widgets on iPadOS17, and thankfully they are also in iOS17. The Reminders one shown piqued my interest to see if there were any other improvements, and thankfully there are. Reminders has always lacked that little something to really snatch usage away from to do apps, but this might tip a few over the edge.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/37bf74c909.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The stock Reminders app now features the ability to add in sections to your lists and also manage them in a Kanban style. Of course, they never call it that, but the ‘columns’ layout found behind the three dots reveals the same functionality. The ease of adding and editing columns needs some work, but this style of to do management could remove a lot of reliance on third-party apps.</p>\n<p>Once again, the iOS update is nothing revolutionary, it introduced lots of little updates that will improve usage. I keep stumbling upon little tweaks that should really help me, so I will keep posting them – follow me through activity pub <a href=\"http://micro.blog/gr36?remote_follow=1\">greg@gr36.com</a>.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Ever since the pandemic hit in early 2020, I&rsquo;ve mostly been enjoying the comfort of working from home. Of course, there have been a few weeks here and there when I had other commitments that required me to be elsewhere. But at least 3 out of 5 days, you can find me tucked away in my cozy spare bedroom, diligently working away. Working from home has brought me incredible benefits like improved focus, work-life balance, and so much more. However, as my professional journey progresses, I find myself having to spread my time between home and office life, and it can be a little annoying.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, my job itself isn&rsquo;t the annoying part. It&rsquo;s the fact that I have the opportunity to tap into the benefits of both working situations, but figuring out how to make the most of it can be a bit of a challenge. Let&rsquo;s face it, working from home (WFH) is an absolute game-changer for many of us — I&rsquo;m a huge fan. It allows me to work longer, deeper and better without the distractions of a traditional office setting. But, there&rsquo;s no denying the wonderful perks of being around other people.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/52740b6b13.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I have begun to appreciate the value of bouncing ideas off my colleagues, engaging in vibrant conversations, and simply having that positive energy that comes from working side by side with others. That&rsquo;s why most days, you&rsquo;ll find me popping into the office for a quick meeting or a planning session before heading back home. Lucky for me, my office is only a couple of miles away from home, but it&rsquo;s still a tad inconvenient.</p>\n<p>I have a desk at work and another one at home, which means I&rsquo;m stuck with two keyboards, two monitors, and all the other gadgets I&rsquo;d rather not drag around. It also means that neither place feels like the perfect fit for me. While I do enjoy some of the advantages of both working environments to a certain extent, it&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;m constantly on the go, working from different spots all the time. Maybe the solution lies in finding a balance by splitting my time and establishing clear boundaries. Honestly, I have no idea how flexible workers manage it, but I&rsquo;m open to suggestions!</p>\n",

There have been times in my life that I’d rather had avoided. Terrible, painful times that have left emotional and physical scars on myself. However, as an ever showing optimist, it was all worth it to get here.</p>\n<p>I could tell myself to not play in that football game that ended my career. Or avoid that relationship that ruined me for a few years. Life events that you would rather not go through always come to mind, but as with every time travelling film teaches us, small events lead to more significant changes. There could be some gains to be made, but if there is any risk of me not getting to meet my wife and have my wonderful kids, for me, it isn’t worth the risk.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/25721f7d02.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Friedrich Nietzsche proposed a thought experiment based on <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/nietzsches-idea-of-the-eternal-recurrence-2670659\">Eternal Recurrence</a>. A demon comes to you at night and says the life you are living is just a cycle. One you will carry on reliving over and over again, exactly the same. All the pain, all the joy. Everything, as it was, forever. Would this change your outlook on life? Would you look at this as a gift or a curse?</p>\n<p>Greater than this though. Whenever you experience painful times, would you look on them better, knowing that they all lead to a point that made you happy. That in those darkest hours when you felt like the world was ending, there was always light at the end. Your newly opened eyes would treat these life events with a more Stoic approach. An acceptance that these bad times need to be bared to get to the good times.</p>\n<p>Then this demon is not required to change your way of thinking because this reality is already true. Through all darkness, there comes light, not matter hoe small. Although we are not destined to repeat our lives over and over again (that we know of) the same thoughts are true.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>In my tendency to over simplify things, I <a href=\"/2023/05/17/get-a-notebook.html\">wrote a post</a> about how to maximise your productivity. There are no apps involved, just <a href=\"/2023/03/12/what-is-my.html\">a notebook</a> and something to write with. No fanciness, no expensive things, just a tried and tested method of keeping everything with you – the problem is: How on earth do you put it to use?</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a practice that is rife in productivity, it keeps people busy and keeps whole companies in business, it’s called <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/\">the collectors&rsquo; fallacy</a>. The logic that saving some things can be helpful, so more must be better. With the only issue being you are quickly drowning in saved ‘things’ and cant make use of it. As R.J. Nestor put it in <a href=\"https://signup.rjnestor.com/posts/weekend-upgrade-35-surface-tension\">his newsletter</a>, the issue is often that capture is too easy and I would also argue too permanent.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>…capture in itself is not the primary problem for most of us. The problem is that we capture too many things, and we don’t have a corresponding way to surface what we’ve captured. — R.J. Nestor, Surface Tension</p></blockquote>\n<p>We’ve all be there. Like a note hoarder, we can&rsquo;t bear to not save something, or later delete it “just incase”. When digital storage is so plentiful, there might seem like no downside to collecting absolutely everything to refer to at some point in the future. However, it then becomes impossible to sift through the pointless stuff and get to the important parts of your system.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/605ca0ed12.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In almost every productivity system I have come across there is always some kind of ‘inbox’ followed by a sorting phase. A review <em>has</em> to take place to make the most of the things you have saved, no matter if they are digital or physical things, you <a href=\"/2022/12/31/manual-practices-to.html\">must review them</a>. The next part is painful, though, you must now admit your errors and throw out most of what you saved.</p>\n<p>Not throw it out per se, but at least no longer dwell on it. If it’s digital, consider deleting it or perhaps not tagging and sorting it. If is a physical note, don’t copy it anywhere else, read it, digest it, and then decide to move on or not. The real benefit of physical notes, of which I am a massive proponent of, is that by writing them out you are more likely to remember them anyway. As much as <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/you-will-remember-information-longer-you-hand-write-notes.html\">70 percent increase</a> if you go through them again in the next 24 hours, and it produces <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210319080820.htm\">stronger brain activity</a> too.</p>\n<p>This post is about more than that though, it is about getting the most out of <em>your</em> system, and that involves sorting your notes afterwards. I have tried <a href=\"/2023/03/17/indexing-a-used.html\">indexing my notebooks</a> for more benefit, but that didn’t last long. Copying out and sorting my mess of a handwritten ledger has proven is essential to surfacing information I can use later on.

				"content_html": "<p>One thing I love about consuming so much written on the internet is that it raises interesting thoughts in my head. Sure, I get annoyed at the constant cycle of AI this, metaverse that, but newsletters like <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/on-the-internet-you-can-in-some-sense?publication_id=9317&amp;isFreemail=true\">this edition for Garbage day</a> from Ryan Broderick really made me think.</p>\n<p>He discusses a friend who passed away, leaving behind herself scattered over the internet, and ponders on what will stay behind. The below passage brought up thoughts about the excellent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_(2017_film)\">Disney film CoCo</a>, that you die twice, once in physical form and again when the last person alive forgets about you. In the modern world, that could be three times.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now, it seems, we die three times. First, when you stop breathing, second, when a corporation deletes your account, and, third, when someone says your name for the last time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’ve written before about my <a href=\"/2021/07/27/be-happy-it.html\" class=\"u-in-reply-to\">thoughts about death</a>, but the way that technology and the services you have used is interesting to think about. In many ways, I could echo around the web for years after my passing because I have put so much content onto it which could be a comfort or dressing to others in my life. Or I could be permanently deleted once I stop paying.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c5f1d00d31.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Ryan talks about all Facebook Messenger chats disappearing once an account turns into a memorial, which would be something that other people might miss. However, Twitter is now recovering whole accounts that have laid dormant for a while, which will include many people no longer with us. No doubt to flog for profit. Bringing into sight the realisation that where you put your online life could be more important in death.</p>\n<p>All this talk of deleting accounts and recovering dormant ones reminds me of wanting a username that appears unused. That handle that I desire <em>could</em> in fact be someone’s comfort, and the ethics of recovering it become a little murky. Thankfully, I feel blessed that I have placed my posts on micro.blog, and they will remain online indefinitely <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2023/05/13/reclaiming-usernames-policy.html\" class=\"u-in-reply-to\">thanks to Manton</a>.</p>\n<p>So, should the time come for me to leave this mortal realm, I <em>will</em> die two deaths, but perhaps not a third.</p>\n",

				"title": "My Brief Experiment With Mechanical Keyboards",
				"content_html": "<p>Can I apologise if this post triggers you in any way, these are simply my thoughts after using a ‘mechanical keyboard’ for a bit, and they may not be all positive. The people that love using these types of keyboard are plentiful online, so I may get an influx of name-calling after this, but please bear with me. I decided to <a href=\"/2023/05/08/i-might-regret.html\">have a bit of an experiment</a> and dove in knowing absolutely nothing, so this very well is the reason behind my thoughts.</p>\n<p>First things first, I bought a <a href=\"https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k3-wireless-mechanical-keyboard\">Keychron K3 v2</a> after some feedback online and seeing that this was reasonably cheap and approachable. This came with Optical Brown switches. I chose this because and after years of using a Magic Keyboard I felt this was a good introduction to this minefield. Your thoughts may differ on this, but I want to be transparent straight away.</p>\n<p>So, I get it. I think that using a mechanical keyboard provides so much tactile feedback that it’s hard to understand until you use one. Known for their ‘clicky’ keys and their multitude of modifications and set-ups you can make, the world of mechanical keyboards is one that I now understand. However, I had two major issues that may be due to this specific keyboard or may just be trade-offs you have to make, I don’t know, but let&rsquo;s just say I am writing this on a magic keyboard.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3fd99b390a.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"comfort\">Comfort</h2>\n<p>They’re no getting around the fact that I didn’t find the K3 very comfortable to use. To accommodate the travel of the keys, even this ‘low-profile’ keyboard is considerably chunkier than I am used to. I knew this going in so allowed it some time to get to, but the hovering my hands had to do, and the weird slant of the keys just made a long typing session painful.</p>\n<p>Could I have become used to it, perhaps over time. Was a prepared to risk it, absolutely not. The K3 added its own ‘screw your wrists’ take on this by slanting the keyboard itself slightly toward you, but the keys slightly away. Meaning, I had no confidence in using the keyboard even after a week or so of hard use. My wrists hurt bad. I tried a wrist rest, I tried changing my posture, I tried numerous things, but it was just too different for my body to like.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wireless\">Wireless</h2>\n<p>As I wanted this to replace my current set up, being wireless was a big selling point. I went into this knowing that this might mean that keypresses are a little less reliable and that wired is often the preferred set up for people. The Keychron K3 was straightforward to set up, came with Mac-specific keys already on the board, but still fell down. The connect time for using the keyboard after being idle for more than 10 minutes was painful. I could change this in the setting to keep it witched on, but opted instead to use the wired mode – only this didn’t work either.</p>\n<p>The cable that the keyboard comes with doesn’t connect to my Mac, at all. Why on earth it is a USB-A version I don’t know, but obviously if you have a Mac that&rsquo;s less than 4 years old you have to use a dongle, but the cable doesn’t work with a dongle! I am not <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keychron/comments/m5frps/unable_to_use_keychron_k2_with_macbook_in_wired/\">alone in finding this out</a>. It works with a regular USB-C cable, so I <em>could</em> use it wired, but at this point I’d just about given up. My frustration for this issue is squarely aimed at this specific keyboard and the choices they made to provide a Mac setup keyboard without a Mac cable, so I can’t hold that against other companies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"this-is-just-me\">This is just me</h2>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t hold this against all mechanical keyboards, like I said before, I genuinely understand the enjoyment people get from using them. The reason I no longer have one is personal, not a slight against those that do. To sum up, I chose to return the Keychron K3 and go back to my Magic Keyboard for a few reasons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comfort of typing in a position I am used to</li>\n<li>Connection issues with a Mac</li>\n<li>Not wanting to spend more money and still not be happy</li>\n<li>Touch ID</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So that&rsquo;s my update in a nutshell.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Apple has <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-previews-live-speech-personal-voice-and-more-new-accessibility-features/\">announced</a> new accessibility features and tools that will help people with cognitive, vision, hearing, and mobility needs. These tools are designed to be user-friendly and incorporate on-device machine learning to ensure privacy. This shows Apple&rsquo;s longstanding commitment to accessibility and making products for everyone.</p>\n<p>Assistive Access is a feature that distills apps and experiences into their essential features, making them easier to use for people with cognitive disabilities. The feature focuses on activities that are foundational to iPhone and iPad, such as connecting with loved ones, capturing and enjoying photos, and listening to music. Assistive Access also includes a distinct interface with high-contrast buttons and large text labels, as well as tools to help supporters tailor the experience for the individual they support.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9f5326e05d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>For users who are nonspeaking or at risk of losing their ability to speak, Apple has introduced Live Speech and Personal Voice. Live Speech allows users to type what they want to say and have it spoken out loud during phone and FaceTime calls, as well as in-person conversations. Personal Voice allows users at risk of losing their ability to speak to create a voice that sounds like them.</p>\n<p>Detection Mode in Magnifier makes it easier for users with vision disabilities to interact with physical objects that have several text labels. For example, while using a household appliance, Point and Speak combines input from the Camera app, the LiDAR Scanner, and on-device machine learning to announce the text on each button as users move their finger across the keypad.</p>\n<p>These new features and tools build on Apple&rsquo;s long history of making technology accessible, so that everyone has the opportunity to create, communicate, and do what they love. The groundbreaking features were designed with feedback from members of disability communities every step of the way, to support a diverse set of users and help people connect in new ways.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Stray too far into self-help or productivity circles, and you will soon come across this idea of a commonplace book. The practice of writing everything down and keeping it in a place you can access later is held up as the reason people are successful and a way for you to get the most out of life. Although people like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2011/07/h-p-lovecrafts-commonplace-book/\">HP Lovecraft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/john-miltons-commonplace-book\">John Milton</a> and even <a href=\"https://myowncommonplacebook.wordpress.com/tag/leonardo-da-vinci/\">Leonardo do Vinci</a> kept one by their side, it is a practice that can be hard to stick too in the modern world.</p>\n<p>Commonplace books are a tradition spanning from <a href=\"https://notebookofghosts.com/2018/02/25/a-brief-guide-to-keeping-a-commonplace-book/?utm_source=pocket_mylist\">the Middle Ages</a>, but one that seems improper in the modern world. Despite all the obvious benefits of manual tasks, the avoidance of feeling out of place is often a powerful feeling. One that I frequently can’t be overcome, I just don’t want to be <em>that</em> guy. There’s just no getting around the fact that carrying around a notebook in a digital world appears strange to most people.</p>\n<p>As such, my first effort at keeping this ‘book’ had to be digital. It makes the most sense as I have my phone or my watch on my wrist nearly all the time, or I am sat at my computer working. Not to mention, all the things I save are then searchable and referenceable easily from all my devices. Saving digital things just makes sense.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9f55ac5bca.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>An app such as Evernote would make an excellent digital commonplace book, in fact, numerous people I know have been doing this all along without even knowing it. Storing photos of notes, whiteboards, web clippings, meeting briefs and all sorts of things in the app to refer to later. Not wanting to spend money on Evernote after being burnt before, I opted to use <a href=\"/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html\">Apple Notes instead</a>.</p>\n<p>The main reason for doing this was to make sure I carried things that I wanted to remember. That I got myself into a better state of working though my ideas and working on them later. So, I built <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ed9071a3301944e4b7c368f93cf831db\">a Shortcut to help me</a> on this journey. To capture quotes from articles I read, thoughts that I could dictate from my Apple Watch, and also anything else I stumbled across.</p>\n<p>The premise was simple. My iCloud notes now contained a folder titled commonplace book. Each time I wanted to capture something, the shortcut checked for a note titled with the current date, if it was missing, it created it along with a time stamped entry. If the note already existed, it appended a time stamped capture to the note.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/69295e6660.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This folder started to fill up with all sorts of things. Quotes, ideas, web clippings, photos and any number of random things. I became quite obsessed with saving things, but I am sure you can already see where this was going. I was absolutely dedicated to saving things in my new commonplace book, but I never went back and looked at it. Never browsed the notes for any other reason than vaguely remembering saving a quote I wanted to reference in some writing.</p>\n<p>The digital folder was a great idea, but it was tucked away. It wasn’t in front of me to be able to look at, flick through and review the entries in it. Although I have confidence, some snippets saved would have been used at some point though searching my phone — I just didn’t get any use from it. It became obvious quickly that the whole point of a commonplace book, for me at least, was physically writing things in it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-note-book-instead\">A Note Book Instead</h2>\n<p>OK, I am a little <a href=\"/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html\">obsessed with notebooks</a> at the moment. Since reviewing my plan for 2023, and reading <a href=\"/2023/01/13/finished-reading-the.html\">Revenge of Analogue</a>, I’ve adopted more manual processes. This means writing more with a pen and paper, as well as being aware of the enjoyment gained from tactile things. I even bought a mechanical keyboard, clicky!</p>\n<p>So, my journal evolved into a commonplace book. There’s a certain level of worry that comes with even mentioning that you have a commonplace book. Most of the questions I see online are variations of “what do I write in this thing” and these exact questions come whenever you get out your notebook. You have to be prepared for this and answer them with confidence. The practice has existed for hundreds of years, and will do long after you are gone, so don’t worry.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dbb431be3b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Oh, and much like with the digital notebook, the answer to what you write in it is <strong>everything</strong>. While these practices make me much more satisfied in a sensory sense, it isn’t perfect. The fact that everything is written down manually, means that you lose all the advantages that digital note bring. They are not searchable and take up physical storage space.</p>\n<p>I tried out <a href=\"/2023/03/17/indexing-a-used.html\">indexing one of my notebooks</a>, using a tag system to allocate areas in which they may be stored if I were to use the <a href=\"https://fortelabs.com/blog/12-steps-to-build-a-second-brain/\">PARA system</a> for <a href=\"/2023/04/06/finished-reading-building.html\">Building A Second Brain</a>. Given that I never referred back to it ever again in that way, I didn’t bother with the next couple of notebooks I have used. I tend to flick through them and pick up ideas and thoughts as and when I need to. This serves as a nice reminder, a diary of sorts, but also a way to review information to help with memory recall. Thats a Win/Win in my (note)book.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>At the iPhone phone launch last September, a thought started to blossom in my head. As they presented all of their new devices, that no doubt they toiled away for months to create, I couldn’t shake the feeling of melancholy. Sure, they are nice and everything, but we might just have reached the pinnacle of what Apple&rsquo;s current technology can offer.</p>\n<p>The truth is, collectively we realised this with smartphones at least a couple of years ago. The iPhone 13, was mostly the 12, that in turn was a more square version of the iPhone 11. You can track the slow and steady ticking forward of the Apple iPhone from the very first one, but what’s inside and what it can actually <em>do</em> tended to take strides forward at least every other year. Now, not so much.</p>\n<p>There is a limit to what can be achieved from a rectangle of glass and metal, and there’s something to be said for Apple&rsquo;s consistency instead of Samsungs spaghetti at the wall approach. Unfortunately, for Apple, the downturn in creativity and technology improvement is also shaping into other devices. I’m not kidding either, Apple Watch, iPad, AirPods, MacBook, they are all pretty <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meh\">meh</a> - and thats a good thing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0caeebeeb3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"you-cant-do-real-work\">You Cant Do Real Work</h2>\n<p>Apple&rsquo;s most contentious device, the iPad Pro, is the perfect example. There has been very little need to upgrade your device since 2018. The current model features very little upgrade past a more powerful processor, making it a little <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipad/ipad-pro-faq/ipad-pro-11-inch-3rd-gen-12-9-inch-5th-gen-2021-performance-comparison.html\">better on battery and more able</a>. Which is great, until you realise that most things you do on your iPad don’t even tax older iPads. The only thing that has changed a lot is the camera if that&rsquo;s your thing (it really shouldn’t be).</p>\n<p>The same can be said for Apple silicone MacBooks. The launch of the M2 MacBook Pro went by with none of the clamouring that the M1 Pro devices got. The tick that had followed the massive tock of desktop devices leaves very little need to upgrade depending on your use case. The M1 Pro powered MacBook that I do all of my work on still feels like it has headroom in every task I throw at it.</p>\n<p>So, we’ve rubbished the upgrades for what’s in your hand, and potentially what’s in your bag, now let’s look at the Apple watch. A device that, once Apple sorted out what they wanted it to be, hasn’t seen a meaningful upgrade in years. Each year, the device gets a little faster and a little better on battery, but you’d have to jump up from a device 3–4 years old to see any improvements. Even then, the argument could be made that it wouldn’t really mean a lot.</p>\n<p>Whilst presenting the newest version last year, almost each proposed upgrade covered could be attributed to software improvements, many of which would be rolled into older devices anyway. Thank god for the Apple Watch Ultra, <a href=\"/2022/11/18/apple-watch-ultra.html\">one of my favourite devices</a> for a few years, for at least a little excitement. I have a feeling that many purchases, my own included, were fuelled by the desire simply for something new.</p>\n<p>I do think this is the right move though. No one wants to be updating their watch every year, and by providing even smaller updates there is less desire to, and less for Apple to shout about. Apple does indeed make devices more aimed towards periodic upgraders than early adopters. Those that get a free phone with their new plan every 2–3 years, rather than us hardcore upgraders.</p>\n<p>Apple doesn’t make devices like it used to. We can&rsquo;t fit them on a table as Steve Jobs said they should do, and they don’t always appeal to everyone. The devices are at the peak of what is a feasible upgrade, and that is becoming less and less about headline features. There’s less to crow about but more to love, the devices have peaked and that&rsquo;s fantastic for all users, and our bank balances.</p>\n",

You read that right, it looks highly likely Tim Cook will take to the stage on the Keynote for Apple&rsquo;s develop conference and finally utter the words Reality Pro. Unfortunately, the long-rumoured VR experience from Apple has already missed its chance to make a splash, and will be launched into a market that doesn’t really exist.</p>\n<p>Since at least the mid-80’s at various volume levels, futurists have been telling us virtual reality will be a massive thing. The slightly dystopian predictions are that we will at least strap things to our faces instead of staring at screens, and if you listen to some people, we might live a portion of our lives in a virtual world. However, that reality has never really panned out.</p>\n<p>It has to be said I am extremely negative towards putting any <a href=\"/2016/10/10/please-dont-put.html\">computer on your face</a>, but still open to the possibility. In many respects, it makes sense, perhaps not to live in a virtual world, but consuming content or playing games is a realistic current and future bet for VR devices.

Being able to put on oversized goggles to be able to watch or use a gigantic screen instead of needing a large panel appeals to many demographics.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/175c9e87b9.jpg\" alt=\"Image credit: Marcus Kane/Sketchfab\" title=\"Image credit: Marcus Kane/Sketchfab\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"you-missed-it\">You Missed It</h2>\n<p>The issue is that the market for this kind of device is already exhausted. Either physically or metaphorically. Niche gaming sections are saturated with cheaper Quest or PlayStation devices. With others completely turned off to the idea due to a bombardment of Meta né Facebook insisting on the future taking place in their world. The truth is Apple scrambled to build a device to fit into a potential market that was promised for years on end, but no longer exists.</p>\n<p>Whatever Apple&rsquo;s entry into VR looks like; or whenever it arrives, it looks set to miss its market bar early adopter Apple fans with too much money. Granted there was a time for about 6 beautiful months where this device made sense. After months of not being able to navigate the web without being inundated with the word metaverse, that time has gone. That time <em>may</em> arrive, but like having business built around web3 in 2023, there’s not much hope currently.</p>\n<p>That is the issue with entering into markets that are still emerging. You risk making the wrong bets. Wasting considerable amounts on money building devices that fall flat rather than sail the current wave of hype. This was something that Apple were notoriously good at. They waited, watched and launched their product a little later than others, but well-rounded and pushing industries forward. You only have to look at products like AirPods as an example of Apple usual ‘wait and see’ market tactic.</p>\n<p>Which makes Apples VR device all the more strange, and something that no doubt is making them pause and think a bit longer. However, it can be said that we are not dealing with the same Apple any more, and even they can make mistakes – huge million-dollar mistakes. Just don&rsquo;t mention AirPower.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I read Matt Birchler’s <a href=\"https://thesweetsetup.com/i-tried-to-migrate-to-todoist-it-didnt-go-well/\">post on The Sweet Setup</a> as soon as it appeared in my feed. Anything he has to say usually leaves me better after consuming it, and it also mentioned Todoist, which I have a soft sport for after <a href=\"/2020/05/18/how-i-use.html\">becoming a brand ambassador</a> a few years ago. It really is a great post, and one that I’ve been able to feel swirling around in Matt&rsquo;s head for some time, but it touches on two points that I really wanted to stress.</p>\n<p>As early as the second paragraph, he points out that chasing the perfect app is a fool&rsquo;s game. It is, as Matt puts it, “a path that leads to madness” and will result in you just going around from app to app and not actually using the thing to get anything done. I’m a <a href=\"/2021/03/19/looking-for-my.html\">scholar of this</a> pathetic chasing, so I think I can speak from experience when I wholeheartedly agree with Matt.</p>\n<p>He’s clear on this, and does a fantastic job of pointing this out. He is no doubt aware of the sway his posts can have over people (<a href=\"/2020/01/21/migrating-from-wordpress.html\">my self included</a>), so this declaimer of sorts is even more worth paying attention to. If you take absolutely nothing away from the post apart from this, then it will have been a worthwhile read. If, however, you have now downloaded Todoist, or Things, stop and just use what you have.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a2cc9b451b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"there-are-feelings-involved\">There Are Feelings Involved</h2>\n<p>The second point that is hinted at several points in the post, and then downright stated towards the end, is that you have to pay attention to the way things feel. It&rsquo;s an important trait to be aware of and something that you may not be able to put into words, but even the best app or system in the world can <strong>feel</strong> wrong. If it does, don’t be afraid to leave it alone despite everyone else evangelising for it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It turns out that the generally joyful UI of Things was more important to me than I realised, and a longer feature list couldn’t win me over — Matt Birchler</p></blockquote>\n<p>Matt speaks of his yearning for change, and whilst it’s essential to take into accounts what other apps can do, if the app you are using just feels better, stick with it. Unless you are hitting walls and cant do things because features are missing, you won&rsquo;t gain anything by messing around.</p>\n<p>If you get a better feeling from the app you already have you will use it more, something particularly critical if that app you are using needs you to use it to get things done. It is one of the reasons I now just <a href=\"/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html\">use a notebook</a>. Everything in my logical brain tells me it’s worse, possibly in every single way, but <a href=\"/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html\">the feeling of using it and writing in it</a> trumps all.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>As millions of users scramble to see where to place our social alliance in the next wave of locked platforms, there is an opposite movement. Existing social networks are investigating how to attract new users but seem destined to put their foot in it by ruining their service. One after another, services change major features, or their whole app, searching for revenue. Forgetting everything that set them apart in the first place and ruining lots of the user experience. All in desperate need of ad revenue.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to look very hard to see how much can be generated by showing your users tailored adverts. Despite every user hating them, gigantic companies with ridiculous income are built on the back of them. The king of the hill and the admiration of others in the market is Facebook, who rakes in more than $110billion a year, with all of it being, bar a minimal percentage, from adverts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/696801c38b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Although social networks that don’t and won’t show adverts exist, such as <a href=\"https://glass.photo\">photo sharing app Glass</a>, there is no denying that showing adverts is vastly more profitable. You only need to look at Netflix and the realisation that <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/netflix-sees-advertising-business-generating-10-of-total-revenue-as-it-matures-73938137\">ad supported users provide more income</a> than paid ones. As soon as this becomes reality, the service is destined to be ruined beyond recognition and dissolve into a regular TV network, over the internet.</p>\n<p>Social media upstart from 2022 BeReal is in a bit of a tailspin and <a href=\"https://getmatter.com/email/23422113/?token=23422113%3AStzdEG76rMkxOLl_FX9Z-gRB4Xw\">currently testing</a> the ability for users to post twice more a day. A move no doubt motivated by the reduced time that their users interact with the app per day. The max two-minute scramble to post during the allotted time is simply not enough time to sell users things, and that cuts the earning potential down dramatically. In return, turning their app from something different and quirky with a unique take, to a worse Snapchat.</p>\n<p>While we’re on the ephemeral messaging app, it seems they are loosing themselves in the pursuit of ad revenue too. Once Snap employee and current stockholder Ellis Hamburger <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23672769/social-media-inevitable-death-monetization-growth-hacks\">tells their tale</a> of fighting the good fight inside the company. As they put it, “trying to make Snapchat different from every other social media app” only to become aware of the thirstiness as a death knell to what makes it great. As they search for more and more engagement, to show you more and more ads.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t exclusive to mobile apps, either. Adverts have ruined the web as a whole for as long as most of us can remember. Why did we bring this print-based mentality to the web? Covering every inch of spare space on your nicely designed web page like you did the spare inches in the editorials. And the news stories. And the buildings. And the <a href=\"https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/boat-advertisements-beach-vacation-ad/\">beaches</a>.</p>\n<p>Like an invasive species, adverts ruin everything. They take up space where they shouldn&rsquo;t be, they track everyone around the web. They try to sell you things you don&rsquo;t need, and now they are changing your favourite apps and ruining services because they pay the most money. Advertising dollars are like a siren&rsquo;s call that cannot be avoided. You can tie yourself blindfolded to the mast of your ship as long as you like, but once you succumb to their call, they strangle the life out of great things and make them suck.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Since the launch of dark mode in iOS I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve disabled the feature other than testing. I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of the constant white used in modern iOS and, although debatable, it saves a bit of battery life by switching off pixels. However apps that don&rsquo;t customise the way dark mode looks really suck.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s much more personal preference that&rsquo;s needed once you flick the switch to dark mode. Some apps opt for replacing the glaring white for simple black. While others go for dark shades of blue or grey instead. Meaning that apps can show their personality and make theirs stand out, but not always to taste.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a99e236dc1.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshots of micro.blog and instead in both light and dark mode\"></p>\n<p>Take the above examples of the upcoming 3.0 update to the micro.blog app and Instagram. One of my most used apps micro.blog uses a not very dark blue colour which is not to my taste at all. I&rsquo;d much prefer the black of Instagram for the app background and this is where dark mode triggers much more personal preference.</p>\n<p>Is it enough for me to stop using the app, no, but it&rsquo;s enough to make me think almost every time I open it that I wish I could change it. Couple this with having a look at <a href=\"https://bsky.app/\">Bluesky</a> and <a href=\"/2023/04/15/i-know-its.html\">thinking their app looks great</a>, I switched into light mode for a bit and what a refreshing change it makes. I&rsquo;m still not convinced with all the white burning my eyes, but it takes away all these personal preferences and leaves me with good looking apps.</p>\n<p>Thankfully a lot of apps give you the option to pick and choose, or even theme the way the app looks. The excellent micro.blog app <a href=\"/2023/02/13/gluon-my-perfect.html\">Gluon</a> gives you the choice to switch to an OLED friendly black background. <a href=\"/2018/04/29/finding-a-use.html\">Drafts</a>, the well liked app for all of your text even offers customised themes and a selection of downloadable options. I just found it strange that I don&rsquo;t really care about every app using white, or slightly off white, but when it comes to off black - yuck.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Whenever the internet loses its mind on something, I find it fascinating. Not to join in with the hot takes, but to see and digest what makes a large proportion of people emotional and try to understand the world a bit better. In these instances, a large proportion of people become experts in the respective field being discussed. The most notable of which was everyone who turned into immunologists during the pandemic, but it constantly happens.</p>\n<p>Recently, I read numerous opinions on the way Spotify is redesigning its app and everyone gives their feedback. Much of it being open criticism of the direction the company is leaning and the complete redesign of its mobile apps. This continually happens with services like Spotify because their users become invested in the service and are right to express their concern.</p>\n<p>However, I think it’s important to remember that no-one outside of Spotify really knows how and why decisions are made. For the risk of becoming an internet expert, I feel like I have enough knowledge of the moving parts behind running a business. More so with the choices and compromises that have to be made when owning a product or launching a new one.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But it comes with a challenge. If you’re going to build this thing into the same application, you’re going to make it back to trade-offs. The trade-off is that you can’t just make the application more complicated. There are benefits to that, but there are also drawbacks - Gustav Söderström</p></blockquote>\n<p>The reality is, you seldom get the product you want to launch. There are a huge number of issues that crop up when designing and making such a complex thing that it can be amazingly frustrating. For fear of never launching anything, you quickly have to come to terms with the fact that perfection is the enemy. If you are expecting to get everything the way you want it, then you will be waiting a long time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6f373d6624.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I listened with interest when Gustav Söderström <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23638082/spotify-redesign-gustav-soderstrom-tiktok-stream-podcasts-music-discovery\">talked to Alex Heath</a> about the new redesign and also some of the compromises that had to be made when he launched the original Spotify mobile app back in 2010. He discussed how they know that the implementation of Podcasts into the new App is not perfect, but it’s the best compromise they can make. In a world where Apple Podcasts is used by 98.5 of users, there is just no point making another app.</p>\n<p>Is it perfect, no, but it’s the best decision they can make for their users. There will always be people who don’t like the changes companies make and no longer use the product, that&rsquo;s unavoidable. There is also be a vocal bunch that shut up and use the new update anyway – remember the fuss on Facebook newsfeeds back in the day?</p>\n<p>Making a product is just one long stream of compromises and decisions based on the information you have. No-one has the same information as the people inside the company making decisions. I realise there is a whole industry built around criticising the designs that tech companies make, I used to be one of them, but there’s a level of understanding needed. I have not been a Spotify user for years now, but I understand exactly where Gustav Söderström is coming from.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the market usually dictates when you have to move to survive, and it’s not always where you want to go. Thankfully, it sounds to me like he genuinely agonises over these things and wants the best for their users, and every so often you have to admit that user is not you any more.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I am amazed at the <a href=\"/2023/03/13/seems-a-controversial.html\">usefulness of recent advancements in Large Language Model AI</a>. Having it <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/product/ai\">integrated into Notion</a>, the tool I use most, has saved me a significant amount of time and increased my productivity at work. I use it to summarise meeting notes, write content from video scripts, and more. The cost pays for itself several times over in time saved – but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I have no concerns.</p>\n<p>The technology, synonymous with (not so)OpenAI, is being used by a wide range of companies. Microsoft is integrating it into Bing searches, and just last week, more apps began to use it. Google is building PaLM, their more generalised LLM, <a href=\"https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/generative-ai\">into Workspace</a>, including Docs, Sheets, Mail, and Slides. Other companies are bound to follow, meaning that almost anything you see may not have been written by whom you attribute the words.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/715ae6567b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Google was the first to start my thoughts about the degradation of thought put into words with quick replies in messages and emails. If you can reply with a tap instead of thinking about what you write, the meaning loses its value somewhat. Now that AI-generated content is available everywhere, the words written by other people carry even less value.</p>\n<p>This might seem absurd to say, for a little thank-you text or a one-line reply to an email. However, the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6DaJVZBXETE\">Google demo video</a> shows the sending of a “Thank You” message to “the team” which is verging on the ridiculous. As my Grandad would always say, “words are cheap, it&rsquo;s actions that pay the bills” – when even the words are not written by you, it defeats the point, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re not far from being able to run <a href=\"https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca\">personalised LLM on a local machine</a> with very little computing power. This will bring wonderful improvements to the way we work, especially in creative environments and offices. However, the weight of words will begin to matter less and less. If you cannot take the time to write and send a thank-you note or a thoughtful reply to your teams, then no one will believe in <em>anything</em> written.</p>\n",

When I chose to use a notebook, I was already thinking about ways to make my notes findable. The action of writing them out manually increases my retention drastically, but I still want to be able to refer to them if needed. The most logical way to do this might be to copy the important ones into a digital service, but then comes the decision on what is important or not, so I decided to tag and index my notes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/47a4a77d75.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The inspiration for this came from my belief that even with digital apps, you still require <a href=\"/2022/12/31/manual-practices-to.html\">some kind of manual curation</a>. If I can quote myself, “What I have noticed from this cycle of trying is that without conscious thought, digital tools can be just as bad as physical ones”. So, if I were to use a digital service, I would go through and tag everything with a rough topic – which can be done manually too. The last few pages are reserved for an index to list these tags and mark the page numbers.</p>\n<p>This could, of course, be a massive waste of time, I will only know how this will go when I need to refer to them, but I hope that this will help. If nothing else, it has meant I spent a few minutes flicking through my notebooks and reviewing my notes, further improving my chance of recall. I am convinced of the improvements that carrying a notebook with me has made, and the great thing is I can mould the process as I go along.</p>\n<p>I’m not one for monthly spreads and making my notebook pretty, my handwriting sucks anyway, it’s more of a tool for my brain. It reflects my scattered thoughts and working life, but I hope my indexing brings a little more order to it.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I have now read three different translations of Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. Each one begins with some background information, details about the way it was written, and quite a bit of musing on what he was actually writing for. It wasn&rsquo;t written as a book, nor for public consumption, but more as a personal journal or notebook. This got me thinking about <a href=\"/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html\">my notebook</a> and how it would be viewed if anyone stumbled across it after I&rsquo;m gone.</p>\n<p>A few people have asked me what I write in my notebook or what it&rsquo;s for, and my answers are always abstract. There&rsquo;s a bit of hand-waving and non-specific words because I find this almost impossible to answer. The general answer is everything. It contains notes about anything I think about. Thoughts, ideas, tasks I need to do, food orders, meeting notes – there&rsquo;s not much that isn&rsquo;t in there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c5f370da43.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In truth, I consider it to be a personal self-help book. It contains loads of notes to myself on lessons learned and ideas to digest. It is both my instructor and my muse towards a better life. There are many notes that echo the meditations that Marcus wrote – words of encouragement to myself or a scolding for living wrong. It contains quotes I hear, things I want to research later, and all the other things that may be contained in a commonplace book, but with an equal amount of uselessness.</p>\n<p>My notebook is highly personal, not because it contains anything embarrassing, but for the fact that it would be next to useless for anyone but myself (and you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to read my handwriting). Embracing all of these manual processes is still fairly new to me, but I feel as if I have rediscovered a life hack. My notebook is always with me, stuffed in my back pocket with a pen, so I can write in it whenever I need to, and I couldn&rsquo;t be without it.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>For far too long, we’ve had <a href=\"/2019/11/20/how-i-use.html\">far too many meetings</a> of professionals involved in <a href=\"/2022/08/28/im-proud-of.html\">my daughter&rsquo;s</a> care. She needs numerous medical appointments, but we also waste a lot of time talking about the things they think she needs. We spend even more time talking about what the rest of the family requires, especially myself and my wife.</p>\n<p>They call us many nice things. Tell us that we require help and support, and then some more charming things. It&rsquo;s all very pleasant. The reality is that, in their professional opinion, we can’t continue the way we do with little to no social care and compare us to other families in similar situations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bfe4316d5c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I am used to this by now. For many years, I have heard how we do “an amazing job” and that it “must be so hard” with what we go through. Which is lovely, but the truth is we know no other way. Lucie was our first child, so we’ve not experienced anything else. When others tell me I do more than I should, and that the situation we are in is hard, I get confused.</p>\n<p>The words of Zen teacher Charlotte Joko Beck in <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781916290303\">Death: The End of Self-Improvement</a> always rattle around my head.“it’s only unbearable for as long as you’re under the impression that there might be a cure” is the best explication for our continued ambivalence towards change. Nothing will ever improve, there is no end to the way our life is, so there’s nothing to lust after.</p>\n<p>Perhaps if we had experienced a different life first, our outlook would be different? A friend of mine who has cereal palsy explained a similar thing to me when talking about his world view. He’s managed to achieve a lot in life and run his own business with a positive mindset because he’s lived with difficulty since birth. Individuals that have not experienced the same and have their life changed through an accident or illness often do not share the same mindset.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with asking for help, that is not the point I am reaching for. It’s more to say that the way I view things is directly related to my experience in life so far. Situations that others may perceive as hard or difficult do not seem so bad to me – mainly because there is some comfort in knowing that there’s no solution possible.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>As much as I share my own, I generally don’t have any interest in other people&rsquo;s lives. This appears to be strange in modern life, as many others consume other lives as entertainment, either on TV or social media. I typically have enough to worry about on my own without looking at anyone else’s. I look upon it in the same terms as the phrase used in relation to prison sentences of “doing your own time” and not letting the people around you affect your life too much.</p>\n<p>I do take note of the world around me though, and often find the little snippets of conversation overheard fascinating. It offers a little peek into what other people are experiencing, although I am sure one that is completely out of context. When sat in a coffee shop, or waiting in line, I frequently catch little glimpses into other people&rsquo;s thoughts and I enjoy taking in other view points on things. Finding out what others experience or are talking about is important to understand where your thoughts are.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6dcb89faab.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It is easy in these instances to make judgements about people. To overhear their worries and fears, and regularly their arguments, and then make decisions about them as a person. To become judgemental and look down on them or view them as wrong. You overhear discussions and arguments that often affect your opinion on people that you haven’t even met. Viewing your life as better. On the other side, if you believe social media, everyone&rsquo;s life looks better than ours because we are comparing <a href=\"/2021/05/31/insides-vs-outsides.html\">insides to outsides</a>.</p>\n<p>What glimpsing into other lives does to me is make me thankful of the life I have. Grateful that I do not have to go through other people&rsquo;s experiences, and be appreciative of the things I have. As Lucy Lord <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/lifestyle/living/2020/1224/1185962-extract-not-a-life-coach-by-james-smith/\">said,</a> “If we could all put our problems into one big pile, we’d take our own problems back every single time”. It&rsquo;s easy to view others through a lens or in a snapshot and decide on our own lives, but when we take a step back and see the reality of our world, we realise how lucky we are.</p>\n",

After our first exploration to the one in Sheffield, we found one in Leicester we really like and go fairly regularly for an hour or two to challenge ourselves. This is our fun time together. On our last visit, James was very disheartened that he couldn’t <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDi9H--408A\">“beat the wall”</a> on the adult course.</p>\n<p>“I still can’t get up there dad” he said whilst we grabbed a drink. Making him think twice about trying again. I <strong>could</strong> tell him that it’s a long way up, he’s only small still, and all sorts of comforting things. However, I said the only thing that should be said in this situation and that is, don’t look at what you can’t do yet, look at how far you’ve come.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/aeb670a5a5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>When we first went, neither of us were anywhere near getting through half of the obstacles, never mind about beating the wall. Only a few months later, he’s swinging from things, darting up cargo nets and has improved his balance and co-ordination no end. That&rsquo;s not enough for us humans, though, our negativity bias focuses on the wrong things. Fixated on what we are still yet to do, instead of what’s already been done.</p>\n<p>There is no better example of this than my task list at work. It’s constantly filled with things I need to do. Like the heads of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra\">hydra</a>, and as soon as I check one off, there is at least another to take its place. Which is fine, until a certain point where you realise you’re on a treadmill with no escape. It starts to feel a bit overwhelming and often leads to a lack of motivation. Pretty quickly, life could become untenable.</p>\n<p>So let’s flip the thinking here. Instead of looking at the outstanding tasks, let’s look at the ones already checked off. Focus on a done list rather than a to-do list. Any time I feel a bit overwhelmed by what’s on my plate, not only do I remember there will <a href=\"/2023/01/30/there-will-always.html\">always be more work</a>, but also flip through <a href=\"/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html\">my Bullet Journal</a> and look at all the crossed off items.</p>\n<p>From there, it’s pretty easy to frame this into a remarkable achievement, rather than a stressful nightmare.</p>\n",

It is very much tongue in cheek because it works for him, but the thought of worrying <a href=\"gregmorris.co.uk/2021/02/13/where-does-this.html\">about where a post goes</a> is not something I want to deal with. I’ve written about the freeing feeling of having <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/2021/03/28/why-microblog.html\">one blog before</a>, but this path of the least resistance seems to be a universal law to help with almost everything.</p>\n<p>There is something to be said about <a href=\"gregmorris.co.uk/2019/12/17/intentional-barriers.html\">intentional barriers</a> in the way of actions you would like to reduce, but for everything else, the easiest path is the way. As Ryder Carol, the inventor of the bullet journal, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DZVaVav8lGo\">put it,</a> “the more apps, the more gaps”. James Clear, writer of Atomic Habits, also defaults <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2r1jyhT2vg\">to one place</a> to store everything. Otherwise, your system falls down due to the need to remember where you saved it in the first place. Defeating the whole point.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter where that place is, but having things spread into multiple areas, or constantly moving them, is just a waste of time and effort. When I think about the amount of time I wasted looking at new <a href=\"gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/02/writing-instead-of.html\">note-taking</a>, <a href=\"gregmorris.co.uk/2021/03/19/looking-for-my.html\">writing</a> and task management apps, I shudder a little. My, and numerous others I see, constant need to look for something ‘better’ costs us dearly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e3e8f62041.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If truth be told, I could never find one digital place that ticked all my boxes. Instead of remembering the information, I had to remember where I put it. So to cut out all the wasted energy overcoming the resistance in my system, I reverted to perhaps the oldest tool known to man – a writing instrument, and somewhere to use it.</p>\n<p>All the resistance is now gone because the only answer is in <a href=\"gregmorris.co.uk/2023/02/12/a-new-notebook.html\">my notebook</a>. Not only am I not worrying where to put things, but I also know where everything is, I can flick through my notebook and find the note I made with relative ease. My concern over previously being able to search digital notes has dissipated because I remember more of them anyway. The act of writing everything down and being able to read through them at any point means my recall is much higher.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t really matter where <strong>your</strong> place is, but by having one place, you are doing yourself a favour. Reducing your cognitive load and giving yourself the best chance at achieving your desired goal. It might be getting tasks checked off, it might be saving ideas, or it might just be the occasional scribble. Take the right path and choose one with the least resistance. You’ll thank yourself for it.</p>\n",

I don’t do it for clicks, although I do love the interaction it sometimes brings. Nor am I interested in any kind of sudo fame that some bloggers manage to achieve. Indeed, my motivation for writing is completely internal, if my intentions were to gain anything from it externally, then I would have put more effort into actually crafting the art and strengthening my skill by now.</p>\n<p>Philosopher Kieran Setiya <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781400888474\">refers to atelic activity</a> as one that its value is not derived from its ultimate aim (telos). This is a label that could, without doubt, be applied to <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk\">my photography</a>. I don’t go out with my camera to provide a result, I do it to see the world differently and enjoy the process. The photographs that are produced are a byproduct of the enjoyment I get from it. Although that <a href=\"/2022/10/03/taking-the-shot.html\">hasn’t always been the case</a> for me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bed509c085.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>These thoughts gave me some reasoning around simply enjoying the process of writing instead of the result. I love writing out my thoughts and that is enough motivation to do it. Although enough of it takes place in private that hitting publish barely seems worth it at all, the process could be enough. However, much like the photos that make it to the end of my photography process, some enjoyment comes from ‘working in public’. Not for a kind of return, purely to share some of <em>my</em> enjoyment with others.</p>\n<p>Dazné <a href=\"https://dazne.net/make/\">summed this up</a> more succinctly than I. “I write foremost for myself. And when others find it useful, then that’s great too”. This <strong>whole post</strong> is me, coming to terms to with my mortality and wanting to understand myself better. If by doing this in public, with a typo ridden blog post, perhaps helps someone else than that&rsquo;s great – but it&rsquo;s not the motivation behind it.</p>\n<p>This process has been helped along by what I read, both in books and online, and my reading list has a strange way of surfacing thoughts just when I need them. If my posts do that for someone else and help them understand the world or themselves, then all the better.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>This app is niche. It only works for micro.blog so all of these words I write will only be applicable to a tiny section of readers – but that doesn’t stop this app being great. It really is the perfect micro.blog app and adds in lots of little features to make the experience much better.</p>\n<p>Developed by <a href=\"https://vincentritter.com/\">Vincent Ritter</a>, one of the developers working on the micro.blog platform, <a href=\"https://gluon.app/\">Gluon</a> ads on top of the service in so many useful ways. He uses his opinionated but thoughtful skills to craft a whole range of services, such as <a href=\"https://sublimeads.com/\">Sublime adds</a> and <a href=\"https://shoutouts.lol/\">Shoutouts,</a> meaning Gluon is no exception.</p>\n<p>What Vincent has done is add in features that really help users of micro.blog out. By listening to the community, he’s able to not only work on the service as a whole, but also build an app to service its users. Features such as customising the way the timeline looks with colours and fonts used mean that you can really make the app yours.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1c45b59161.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Two big features really stand out though. Gluon adds in the ability to mute keywords and I couldn’t be happier. I have struggled with the option to filter out things, particularly American politics, right from the start. An issue that was further exacerbated by being able to follow Mastodon accounts. With Gluon, there’s no more politics in my timeline, nor endless posts about Twitter. Whatever it is that you would rather not see, Gluon powerfully filters out these posts and makes it a much better place to be.</p>\n<p>Secondly, Gluon can reply to all. You don’t realise you even need this option until you are involved in an interesting discussion. You are stuck going backwards and forwards copying usernames, whereas Gluon does it all for you. With the added option of removing people from the reply. Sounds so simple doesn’t it, but it’s so helpful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/71ecc156ea.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Gluon also has all the expected features like the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/micro-blog/id1253201335\">official app</a>, but with much more customisation. The controls and navigation of the apps are intuitive and well thought through. The simple interface allows you to reply or see the conversation by swiping the post, and four tabs at the bottom get you to the places you need to go.</p>\n<p>There’s something about Gluon that I really enjoy using, and although the 3.0 update of the official app looks great, Vincent’s app seems to be constantly improving. It makes the micro.blog experience much better for me, and I really appreciate its development.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Whenever I am ready to start a new notebook, I get scared. Particularly if it is a nice one. I do this dance with myself where I make excuses not to start it because I would rather not ruin it. Of course, I do eventually start writing in it, and within a very short time it is battered and bruised like all my other ones. Doing its important work until the cycle starts again.</p>\n<p>I love notebooks. I always have, even before I was a <a href=\"/2023/02/11/do-i-even.html\">serial notetaker</a>, I loved the idea of having loads of stationary and filing it up with thoughts and ideas. This hardly ever became reality because I never knew what to write to give this delightful new notebook the excellent content it deserved. My hand writing sucks after years of typing everything up in academia and publishing explosively online. Seriously, it’s embarrassing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e83a925afa.jpg\" alt=\"My current battered Moleskine Cashire after only a few weeks use.\" title=\"My current battered Moleskine Cashire after only a few weeks use.\"></p>\n<p>These feelings of dread are <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooks/comments/2dernj/i_have_the_new_notebook_dont_want_to_ruin_it/\">not exclusive to me</a>. I read numerous posts about people spending money on notebooks and not knowing what to write in them. <a href=\"/2022/12/31/i-really-want.html\">Worrying about making the perfect Bullet Journal</a> setup (me), or wanting to supplement their notes with cute little doodles but not actually being able to draw (also me). When the only thing you can do it ruin it, and do it the justice it deserves.</p>\n<p>Matt Christey <a href=\"https://medium.com/writers-blokke/deliberately-ruin-a-page-of-your-new-notebook-cf2c36becc8a\">shares these feelings</a>, with a bit of animosity mixed in. “I hate new notebooks. They’re too perfect. Especially when the paper is nice” he says before systematically ruining a page of every new notebook he buys. By creating one intentional fuck up, this allows him the space to fill the rest of the pages with things that might not work, but won&rsquo;t be as bad as the ruined page.</p>\n<p>Starting a new notebook is a bit like standing on the edge of doing something dangerous. There’s a mixture of “I better not mess this up” with a realisation that you actually need to use this thing. As I said the only thing to do is get on a ruin it. A new notebook is made to be used and abused by its owner, otherwise what’s the point?</p>\n",

The company has been producing notebooks since 2007 and has grown in popularity since then. They offer a wide range of limited edition notebooks, which are released quarterly. These editions are highly sought after and often sell out quickly.</p>\n<p>The most popular editions of <a href=\"https://fieldnotesbrand.com\">Field Notes</a> notebooks include the National Parks, Expedition, and Great Lakes series. These editions feature unique covers, interesting paper stocks, and special features like gussets, pocket notebooks, and more.</p>\n<p>The National Parks series features some of the most striking designs to date. There are eighteen Memo Books all together in six different 3 packs.

These revolutionary notebooks have even been to the South Pole!</p>\n<p>The Great Lakes series features a unique cover design with a blue tint and outlines of America&rsquo;s Great Lakes.

				"title": "The Next Generation Of Creative Work",
				"content_html": "<p>There’s a lot of talk out there about AI and the future of this, that and the other. The opinions range from creative work is doomed, to “no, this is fine” and many more somewhere between. I am sure you’ve read loads of hot takes – well, here’s mine, and it’s a bit different from most.</p>\n<p>I am a creative worker. I run design, marketing, and content for a business and I have been doing it a long time. I’ve seen things come and go, trends grow and fade. The use of AI in, well, absolutely everything, feels different. There’s a reason people are both fascinated and terrified at the same time because this really will be a drastic change. I feel as if we are seeing the next phase of technology evolve before our eyes, and there is a lot to look forward too.</p>\n<p>There are some logical fears as well. A genuine worry that platforms like GPT will remove the need for writers, reporters, and even artists. That individuals who have spent years learning their crafts are going to see their job opportunities disappear overnight. The reality is that we are still a very long way from that, but there <em>is</em> a cause for concern.</p>\n<p>Undoubtably, some organisations will replace their creative workers with AI. Those are the organisations that are not in their field for the good of the world, just to turn a profit. A bot has been able to cobble together a blog post, or a factual news article for a long while, albeit with a lot of oversight and correction, but as technology improves so too will the output. Those that straight away lean on these tools are not the type of organisation you want to be working for anyway.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b78b79987e.jpg\" alt=\"digital art of a male writer crying onto their laptop by Dall-E\"></p>\n<p>Those that view a person with experience as expendable, to be replaced by code, are using you as a tool already. They are simply upgrading their tools to the newest available, like a business would anything else it owned. Thankfully, they are still going to need people to do the work for them. There will become a whole market for those that can interact with the AI to create the best possible outcome – and that will be the new creative market worker.</p>\n<p>By using the experience from creating, the new creative worker will learn to use AI to make their job easier, rather than resit and lose their job entirely. Crafting prompts and detailed instructions for the AI, putting them together and checking them over afterwards. You may be getting <a href=\"https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F\">Midjourney</a> to illustrate the hero image of a blog post about Twitters new crisis, written by the latest iteration of <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a>. Tweaking the prompt and output as you go to reflect the tone you require and elicit the correct emotional response.</p>\n<p>You might be the editor of an online magazine that is prompted to cover a specific company because the traffic would spike. Or an SEO consultant that can use AI to scan a website and improve its ranking based on data from all the readers from the last year. Whatever it may be, you <em>will</em> rely on AI, so embrace it now. There will be reduced need for workers, there’s no getting around this, but those that skill up will become the new full-stack developer unicorn.</p>\n<p>Sure, anyone can type into a prompt box and get results. Anyone can search Google and find what they are looking for. It is the next step that yields better results. Knowing the keywords and short codes that will find exactly what you require in a faster time. The new creative will be one that speaks to a developed AI instead of a dumb algorithm.</p>\n<p>Charlie Warzel mentioned <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/google-bing-race-to-launch-ai-chatbot-powered-search-engines/673006/\">in his excellent piece yesterday</a> that there is already a growing market for those individuals that can coax the very best results from the AI tools available. Being able to sell your understanding and ‘speak’ to the AI tools available is already a viable income. Like the jump from film, to digital and then into the Photoshop era pissed off photographers who didn’t evolve, so too will AI if you’re not onboard.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Over the last few months, I have had a few questions in my working life on how I stay so focused. I have made myself a fairly rigid routine, particularly when working in the office, of putting my headphones on and pumping out work. The weird reason I’m able to do this when seemingly everyone else chats or bangs away answering emails is my acceptance of how distractible I am.</p>\n<p>We all have a section of our brain dedicated to instant gratification. People often refer to is as our chimp brain, <a href=\"https://mo.work/blog/how-to-master-the-habits-of-high-performing-teams/\">Dave Brailsford calls it our Lizard brain</a>, it’s the part of us that isn’t interested in anything but itself. It urges you to stop when you’re exercising, it talks you into another slice of cake, and it keeps you scrolling social media. Whatever it desired, if I am not paying attention it’s in charge.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/36aa0d6f1d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The great thing is I have realised this and put things in place to stop it. Trained myself to quieten it down in certain situations and removed the temptations it loves. Once my headphones are on, and I’m <a href=\"/2021/12/18/brain-fm-the.html\">listening to Brain FM</a>, I’m pushed into a kind of flow state and it doesn’t stand a chance. My phone is out the way, I’m in Work Focus mode, and there’s nothing but <a href=\"/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html\">a notebook</a> by my side.</p>\n<p>There are no superpowers going on here. It seems like everything in our modern lives is made into distract us. So, you <em>need</em> to remove them. Phones, apps, web browsers, whatever it is, before long your monkey brain will get its way and whisk you away. Simply by recognising how distractible I am, could I begin to combat it. As soon as I feel the itch I recognise it and push it away, and if it becomes too much I tend to have a walk around for 5 mins. In this time it important to be disciplined, I wouldn’t dare look at my phone!</p>\n",

				"title": "Bring Back The iPhone Battery Case",
				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> has allowed more innovative things to come out than I imagined. It’s become more than the pointless plug that was introduced alongside the iPhone 12. Apple built a pretty great range of accessories. It’s bound to be improved upon over the years, but before that happens, can we please go back to the iPhone battery case.</p>\n<p>Before everyone yells at me to tell me how horrible it looks, I get it. It was ugly, heavy and a bit of a nightmare to get in your pocket – but the iPhone battery case sold alongside iPhone from 7 to 11 was an excellent solution. It is an exceptional application of function over form and far exceeds the usefulness of the current MagSafe battery.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e031179b13.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>For around £130 you could boost the battery of your iPhone by around 80%. This depended on your usage, but by using one on my iPhone 7 I could double the battery life easily and also have a case around my phone at all times. Admittedly, this wasn’t the nicest case in the world. Made from a very grippy rubber that seemed to pick up pocket lint like it couldn’t bare to be away from it – it still kept your phone protected.</p>\n<p>The MagSafe battery pack in comparison costs around the same as the old battery case, but doesn’t function nearly as well. Arguably it is a more elegant solution, you can slap the battery pack on as and when required instead of carrying around the battery all day. With the MagSafe magnets keeping it attached to the back of your iPhone 12/13 or 14. However, in reality it barely clings to the phone, and you have to handle it with care to actually keep charging your phone.</p>\n<p>There is no case to keep the battery pack attached to the back of your phone, leading to loss of charge and a much less economical way to charge your phone. By using wireless charging to charge the phone instead of the Lightning method used by the battery case, the MagSafe battery pack gives you around another 40-60% charge. Possibly more, but the rate and level of charge is dictated far more by phone usage and temperature.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c2988de66f.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Should you need to recharge your MagSafe battery pack, it needs to be plugged into Lightning, thus kind of defeating the whole point of it. You can’t wirelessly charge the wireless battery, but you <em>can</em> charge both at the same time, albeit very slowly. The battery case does require the same Lightning charging, but charges both your phone and your battery at the same time and much quicker than MagSafe. With no issues with loss of connectivity nor heat.</p>\n<p>I also think the case is a much more pleasing solution than the white battery stuck to the back of your phone. The battery case was not the nicest looking case in the world, far from it, but the MagSafe Battery is much worse. It doesn’t fit to the back of the phone very well and, although it arguably looks OK on an iPhone Mini, it looks ridiculous on the iPhone Pro Max versions.</p>\n<p>What they both do have going for them however is excellent support built into iOS itself. Being able to see the charge of both batteries at glance makes them both much better options than many third-party versions. If Apple sold a separate case to fit over both phone and battery pack, the MagSafe battery would be much more usable, but frankly they should just go back to using the battery case full stop.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I know what you’re thinking, yet another put down post for my pet hate social media site, but no. There’s some praise this time, kind of. The truth is, there is nowhere else that’s quite like Twitter. I can <a href=\"/2022/11/16/some-small-thoughts.html\">muse all I like</a> about what brands should be doing, but if you’ve got an issue, and you want it resolving – doing it in public on Twitter usually gets results.</p>\n<p>For the last few days, I’ve been trying to get my company sorted on a business plan with <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/\">Craft</a>. It’s not my favourite app in the world, but I tried loads with the team, and it was the most rounded for what we needed. Unfortunately, the sign-up has been less than smooth, so I reached out to them via their preferred email method and waited. Two days passed by, and baring in mind I was waiting for to spend money, I received no reply.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dd1ad01c8d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There is something to be said about my confidence levels in their product now, and I’m frustrated. So, I did the only thing I could think of, logged into Twitter for the first time in months to tweet at them. In minutes, I have a reply from the co-founder Viktor and an email address to contact him.</p>\n<p>The issue is not resolved yet, and I’m not far way from walking away instead, but this shows the power that Twitter has. Nowhere else can you do this with brands and get your issue sorted. This isn’t unique to Craft, I’ve done it numerous times over the years and sorted numerous issues all on Twitter – via a quick tweet and usually a follow-up by DM.</p>\n<p>The chance of this being possible on Mastodon is frankly slim to none. Although I still hold up hope that the same activity could be replicated, I think that we would have started to see movements by now. There’s just something about Twitter that, I doubt, could be replicated elsewhere.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I’ve tried several times to articulate my feelings on <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\">Readwise Reader</a>, but failed every time. Sometimes frustratingly so because I think a lot of my problems relate to things I feel when using it. Don’t get me wrong it works great, and some features are really well done, it just doesn’t feel like it wants me to enjoy reading.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5426bd7384.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>So, I’m stuck trying to pin down thoughts on sometimes ephemeral feelings provoked by an app. You can’t measure and compare feelings, but you know when they just don’t push your buttons. In contrast to <a href=\"https://hq.getmatter.com/\">Matter</a> that I have been using as my read it later app for quite a while, it feels strange. With all its straight edges and <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2013/05/06/android-what-does-holo-mean/\">hollo like colours,</a> it always strikes me as industrial.</p>\n<p>It feels like it is made to <a href=\"/2022/04/10/reading-doesnxt-need.html\">hack my reading</a>. I can swipe this way and that way, highlighting until my heart&rsquo;s content. Optimised to get through my queue as quickly and as easy as possible by pushing me towards using keyboard shortcuts, recommending highlights and archiving everything for use later on. If I’m too busy to even read the article, I can ask AI to summarise it for me, and even write talking points on it.</p>\n<p>If that’s your thing, and I believe it is for many people, this app is great. There are loads of options and what seems like a never-ending series of screen options. It’s just not for me, and that’s OK. Matt Birchler did an really great overview of its features and you can check it out below. I’d highly recommend a subscribe to Matts channel too, it’s one of my favourites.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZTYCA73I5uQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>For a reading app, I think it’s important to make reading the most important factor. Everything else should get out of the way, with intuitive and easy to reach controls. Otherwise, you’re in danger of creating a busy environment that leads to an overwhelming feeling once articles build up.</p>\n<p>I am currently still using both Readwise and Matter for different reasons. Reader to fly through my subscribed feeds and work related newsletter reading, and Matter to relax whilst catching up on my saved articles. With them both being premium services, and reasonably expensive ones at that, this can’t continue once my free trial is up. There are no difficult decision to make for me, but I love that Reader exists. Both to push Matter forward and to offer alternatives for people that need different things. If you’re in the market, it’s worth checking out.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Like most people I know, I am constantly worried about getting through my task list. At times in the last couple of years I’ve been absolutely buried with no way out. I’m always desperate for ways to maximise my time and ‘hack’ my way to getting more done. Judging by half of the YouTube videos I am suggested, I am not the only one, but there <em>is</em> a surprising fix.</p>\n<p>I must preface this post by saying that these thoughts are 100% inspired by the brilliant book <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780374159122\">4,000 weeks</a> by Oliver Burkeman. A book I descovered by complete accident after stumbling on some of his <a href=\"https://www.oliverburkeman.com/posts\">blog posts</a>. There’s also a certain amount of presumption going on here, we don’t all control our task lists, but we can all control the way we approach them. So, I feel as if there are loads of areas of life that these general thoughts can be applied to.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e9c77aa777.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>When it comes to work, it isn’t often the actual tasks that cause the issues. It is the stress of having so much to do and never enough time to do it. The way of the world seems to be stuffing more and more things into less and less time. It doesn’t matter if the things you have to get done are decided externally or your deadlines are internal, the end of your task list will <strong>never</strong> come.</p>\n<p>There will always be more work to do. Things that you could get done, and jobs that are waiting for gaps in your time. Companies expect more and more from their workers, and getting towards the end of your list only leads to more tasks. It is only when you realise that you can only get done what you can the real freedom comes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are you still under the illusion that you&rsquo;ll one day reach a point in your life where you no longer have any problems? — Sam Harris</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is absolutely no point stressing about getting to the end because modern life is a treadmill you can never get off. Much like “inbox zero” only leads to more emails, all the modern productivity punchlines just lead to more work. By embracing the fact that the end will never arrive, you can relax, knock as many tasks off as you can and get some downtime.</p>\n<p>No revelation will happen, but the freedom from feeling guilty for the tasks you complete just leads to a happier life. It might lead you to get better work done, too.</p>\n",

				"title": "Journaling And Me",
				"content_html": "<p>There are not many things that improve my life straight away any more. Meditation did exactly that around 6 years ago, and now journaling is doing the same thing. You read that right, me, journaling. After all my dismissive posts and words over the years of not knowing or wanting to write in one. I’ve got to admit, it’s quite remarkable.</p>\n<p>I realise that it is only the end of January, and it’s easy to exaggerate the benefits before the novelty has worn off, but hear me out. I also might be preaching to the choir a bit here, as many people that I follow are already proponents, but I’ll talk about it regardless. This isn’t a New Year’s resolution, but more like a reevaluation, one that I <a href=\"/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html\">talked about before starting out</a>. I paid up for a year of Day One to see what happens, it also went to the store and bought some journals too. This is a journey split into two parts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/230ac89cf0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"day-one\">Day One</h2>\n<p>A long journey starts with a single step, and that tiny little movement forward was actually posting to Day One. I’ve <a href=\"/2022/12/28/outside-of-twitter.html\">had it installed</a> on my phone more times that I care to remember, but struggled to write much. Instead of spending any money on this crazy idea I had, I made myself start writing at least one post a day electronically. It was a little test for me that I had to complete for me to gain the reward of any expenditure.</p>\n<p>After the first couple of day of writing, frankly nonsense, each morning, I could see the difference. By not expending too much mental energy and letting my fingers type out exactly what I was thinking about and feeling with no prompts, I literally kick-started my day. I felt happier, more relaxed and resolved my thoughts first thing in the morning. After just <a href=\"/2023/01/05/journaling-for-journaling.html\">5 days I stumped up</a> and bought Premium because I knew straight away I was on to a <a href=\"/2023/01/09/day-streak.html\">winning idea</a>.</p>\n<p>Now 29 days in, I’ve posted consistently at least once a day as early as I get time. This is a <a href=\"https://littlecoffeefox.com/morning-pages-changed-life/\">morning pages</a> of sorts, a literal brain dump of everything swirling around in my head. I have often followed this up with smaller thoughts and any other things that I am thinking about. It took effort and went slowly at first, with great trepidation.</p>\n<p>Whenever I get a feeling or a thought, I reach for Day One now and just type it out to see where I get to. Some of these turn into blog posts, but most don’t. They are just for me, and I probably won’t read them again. Just knowing they are there is enough to make me feel better. I would love to do this manual with a pen and paper, but the thought of it being accessible by others terrifies me. Not because I have anything to hide, but it’s embarrassing to think of someone else reading my thoughts.</p>\n<p>Due to how well this small step went, I treated myself early and bought a bullet journal, thus starting the second step of my transformation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1a3abb569c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"bullet-journal\">Bullet Journal</h2>\n<p>A massive experience that paid off. That’s the way I’m describing my bullet journal that is constantly open on my desk or in my hand being carried from meeting to meeting. Where I once sit typing away into my MacBook, I’m now writing into my bullet journal and people are noticing the difference.</p>\n<p>On the surface, I know that I shouldn’t be using a manual bullet journal for task planning and note taking. It makes no sense, as I’ve <a href=\"/2022/12/31/i-really-want.html\">covered before</a>, <a href=\"/2022/06/21/putting-a-system.html\">more than once</a>. It’s often redundant, takes more work and isn’t searchable. I realise when a spend so much time at a computer or with a phone, it makes sense to use digital tools. Yet writing things out manually, being intentional about things, and just flipping through pages ignites something in me.</p>\n<p>It is as if the physical act of bullet journaling stimulates me more. I remember more things, take more notes, manage and plan things better. There appears to be no downsides. Well, perhaps the slightly precarious position that all physical things are in. Bar loosing my book, or not having it with me, it’s all positives.</p>\n<p>To combat this slightly, I’ve adopted a ‘Field Notes’ notebook that’s usually in my back pocket, just in case. Mine is actually a Moleskin version, but most people are more accustomed to what Field Notes looks like. This is perhaps the most significant change in my life and one many people have commented on. I’ll admit it’s a little weird, but it helps me live a much more intentional life, and is another solution to <a href=\"/2022/02/10/the-ultimate-minimalist.html\">my life becoming phone free</a>.</p>\n<p>Seen something worth thinking about. Make a note. Heard something on a podcast that I want to research later. Make a note. Thought about a peculiar thing that you would like to find the answer to. Make a note. Seriously. Yesterday I wrote in my field notes “what is the psychological theory why you see new things all the time”. Turns out I was thinking about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion\">frequency illusion</a> or the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon. Could I have found this out with a quick Google on my phone, of course, but I would have forgotten it as quickly as I looked it up.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6f3b7d74bb.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The physical act of writing something down improves my memory of it - <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2021.634158/full\">it’s science</a>! Yet, every person I mention this too seems blown away by manual writing things down. Is it a bit of a pain transferring things if I want to write about them or research them later, yes. That’s the point though. I can review all the notes I make, and think about them several times, with a quick flick through my field notes. Leading to better retention, more ideas and more awareness of my thoughts.</p>\n<p>For me there is often a tendency to preach about a new practice that has yielded results too early. So I have tried to put off writing about this for a while. There’s often a turning point at the start of the year, even if you don’t make resolutions per se, just to decide to do things a bit differently. However I am well past January 14th which is <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2022/01/17/have-you-quit-your-new-years-resolution-by-quitters-day/\">quitters day</a>, and don’t see these new practices changing.</p>\n<p>I think there are more <a href=\"/2022/12/31/manual-practices-to.html\">manual things</a> that I can bring in to aid my digital life. As I said, intellectually I know that perhaps leaning on apps is the way to go, but emotionally and mentally writing things down and ticking things off fulfils me more.</p>\n",

I know intellectually what is best for me, but I also have crippling FOMO, so I go around in circles.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/272bc58a76.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I often think I need a smaller phone. Or a bigger one. Or no phone at all. What I always want is the opposite of what I have. Because I’ve fallen for the fallacy that a specific thing will change everything. Almost like the <a href=\"https://notes.gr36.com/provisional-life\">provisional life</a> that Swiss psychologist Marie-Louise von Franz proposes. I am convinced that once I have the other version of this thing, <em>then</em> I’ll have the device I’m happy with.</p>\n<p>There once was a magical time when Apple produced one iPhone, I bought that and used it for a year until the new one came out. Then came a plus version that I deliberated on a bit and usually bought the big version. Now I have (if I include last year&rsquo;s mini version) five to choose from. Well, 4 really because no one wants an iPhone 14 plus.</p>\n<p>All with their advantages and disadvantages, not to mention various price points. Giving customers excellent choice. Which means that someone always has the version you don’t and the grass always seems greener to someone like me. Even after years of knowing that I have this issue, I still haven’t solved it. Despite all the minimalism mantras and deep thinking, my issue with iPhone remains, and it could be an issue forever.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>The posts I write do not disappear into the recesses of my mind, I think about them often. My thoughts and feelings often change over time, but when it comes to my attitudes towards work, I’ve remained fairly fixed for years. Whereas the general perception of work has had a major culture shift, accelerated by the pandemic, and one that is great for the world. Hustle culture and working because that’s what you’re supposed to do has been replaced by a desire for more.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5904fd6f64.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>As the post points out, you shouldn’t be working for anything else but yourself. Not in the sense that we should all have our own businesses, that would be great too. More in the sense that you should want to do the work or the tasks you do. It might seem like meaningless tautology, but the importance of stressing that “You make the job; it doesn’t make you” is vital.</p>\n<p>At the root of every position you take should be a root desire for you. It doesn’t matter what that desire is, nor the way it manifests itself. It should be something that fulfils you. Emotionally. Spiritually. Furthermore, it is at this point I must bring up the excellent words of Patrick Rhone.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If I were paid to dig ditches, I would discover that the ditch is for a water line to a new house that means someone gets clean water. Once I think it through, I can find my passion in the ditch digging. - <a href=\"https://www.patrickrhone.net/profit-and-passion/\">Patrick Rhone</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong. You can still have a job, it be a job, and you don’t need to be excited by it, nor it reflect anything about you. However, I would bet that you can find something in it to be excited about, but even so that job isn’t you. You are not your job, you are a person, and your job should be how you make money to be that person.</p>\n<p>I’m one of the lucky ones. I have a job I enjoy, and it lifts me up as a person. It is still not me. Unfortunately, not many people are as lucky as I. To leave you with one take away, a distillation of all of these words down to a few, it is to remember “You are not the work you do; you are the person you are”.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Around this time two years ago, I decided that there was a whole medium I need to get more out of, Podcasts. I spent a lot of my time listening to them whilst driving, walking the dog and many other things. Listening to some fascinating shows, but I never took much away from them apart from surface level enjoyment. So, I decided I needed to hack them like <a href=\"/2020/08/22/my-reading-flow.html\">I did with reading</a> and start to make notes against all the points I found interesting. I was wrong.</p>\n<p>First things first, there is something to be said for taking notes from a podcast. Perhaps not every podcast (maybe ignore most of the points made on Joe Rogan, for example) but many that I listen to are information dense, and I sometimes think that I’d like to learn more about this. With that said, with the ability to note everything down, and have it synced over into an app ruined a lot of the experience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b13c41cd83.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Not only was I triple clicking my AirPods like crazy (that’s the shortcut to save a clip in the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/airr-audio-conversations/id1355926315\">podcast app Airr</a>) I was missing the whole point of listening frequently. Due to the volume of notes I was making, the actual process of saving and going over them later was untenable. When you note everything, it misses the point of note-taking completely. If everything becomes a note, then nothing does.</p>\n<p>Not to mention that podcasts became something to concentrate on and worry whether I should have noted that last statement or not. Constantly reminding and listening again to see if I got the point, rather than consuming something in the background whilst doing a more important task. It didn’t take me very long to burn out and not want to listen to anything any more.</p>\n<p>Much <a href=\"/2022/04/10/reading-doesnxt-need.html\">like reading</a>, for me, some activities don’t need to be hacked to get the most out of them. They are downtime or a background content to passively consume. When I need to take notes I will every now and again, using Siri or <a href=\"/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html\">Apple notes</a> and that suits me fine. I’ve only just returned to listening to them again because I tried too hard to make the most out of podcasts, and it made them suck. Don’t make the same mistake.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Over the last few days, I’ve been reading a lot about the rediscovery of minimalism. This is 100% because of the circles I move in, but a few people around me are discussing similar thoughts and ideas that I have currently. Finding more value in having less stuff and getting back to basics.</p>\n<p>I can honestly say that the original Minimalism film on Netflix, before they remade it in 2020, changed my life. It followed these two guys that I’d never heard off through their journey of spreading the ideas that turned their life around. It features some wonderful people like <a href=\"https://micro.blog/patrickrhone\">Patrick Rhone</a> that opened my eyes to a life of enjoying experiences and people, not things.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2594bbb177.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Somewhere in the following months and years, there was a transformation in the way minimalism was portrayed. The people I followed and looked up to changed. It became like a cult of people that waved their flag of how little they had. The message became a constant cycle of telling you to sell your bed, or they were selling you stuff. Much like <a href=\"https://ctmiller.net/2023/01/03/minimalism-maybe.html\">CT Miller</a> I fell off when minimalists were constantly trying to sell me their Patreon, or their course, or whoever else they could flog. As he puts it, “as minimalism began to dovetail with financial planning and whole food health claims, I got off the bus”.</p>\n<p>Minimalism was no longer a way to live a happier life by letting go of things. It was a way to make money and virtue signal at every point along the way. A cult with arguably a good message, but a cult all the same. Those that had given up their jobs to spread the word, had run out of things to say. Minimalism is a pretty simple message, after all. So, they began to give out advice on everything and anything, like a Christian preacher that begs for donations, it ruins the message along the way.</p>\n<p>The evolution was from minimalism, the way to look at the world and enjoy more things. To minimalism being a marketing angle. This happened with mediation, mindfulness and numerous other words before it. But flipping the message of less into a way to sell you things was truly disgusting.</p>\n<p>There <em>are</em> still true voices out there, though. It is those that are causing this new wave of minimalism. Writers like <a href=\"https://www.patrickrhone.net/\">Patrick</a> are an inspiration to people like me and helping make my life a better place. There’s true value in living with fewer things and appreciating people much more than stuff, but you have to work a bit more to find them.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I’ve never been a fan of black and white photos. Not in the sense that I don’t like them, I’m just not drawn to them, and they don’t speak to me as much as some people. My wife, on the other hand, is obsessed with black and white. Shooting in it constantly, or editing all of our photos into monochrome afterwards. Every single photo print that is up in our house I’ve had to edit into monochrome to her tastes, and until now, it’s been frustrating.</p>\n<p>I have no idea what flipped in my head at the weekend, but I just decided to go out and shoot in black and white. I found a really <a href=\"https://fujixweekly.com/2022/12/28/ilford-fp4-plus-125-fujifilm-x-t5-x-trans-v-x-trans-iv-film-simulation-recipe/\">nice film recipe that emulated old Illford film</a> and <a href=\"/2023/01/08/no-idea-why.html\">off I went</a>.</p>\n<p>Since doing so, I’ve shot so many basic things that have been transformed to show much more in the photo. By switching to black and white, the images show so much more drama. Not to mention, I feel like I’m stepping back in time to one much simpler than now. The below shot is straight from camera jpegs whilst walking the dog to try to show what I mean. It’s boring, but appealing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/96bfbdea86.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I love the noise, the creamy colours and the texture of the leaf. There’s just something about black and white that I’ve failed to notice so far. Perhaps it’s because I’m shooting <em>in</em> black and white, so I’ve only ever seen the shot that way. Instead of shooting in colour and effectively removing it all? I’m not certain.</p>\n<p>This isn’t so to say I’m converted, but a simple change to my camera has enabled me to see things differently. There aren’t many things that are like this any more, so it’s a strange feeling. Plus, I also have my wife’s “I told you so” in my ear!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/80159e08e2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6a11e49a4b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n",

I discovered this one through a post by fellow micro.blogger <a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"https://heydingus.net/blog/2022/12/folder-peek-app\">Jarrod Blundy</a>, and it has become a staple of my Mac usage ever since.</p>\n<p>Do you ever have to go digging around in finder to head to the same usual folders time after time? Me to. We have a Dropbox shared archive at work that drives me insane with the amount of level changes I need. Sure, I could set up a load of messy aliases or dock folders, but this apps solves all of that. Placing a nice and neat icon in my menu bar and storing all the folders I require.</p>\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/531d519647.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>I can also navigate around with ease to other destinations, see a preview of the file, or open the file I require without leaving my desktop. There are so many delightful little touches that it's hard to point out them all. My favourites are right-clicking on the icon opens the folder in finder, and that I can set a few different folders to all be accessible from one menu bar icon. Although it is starting to look a bit full now!</p>\n<p>I am so impressed with this app I’m also testing a few other ones by the same developer <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/apps\">Sindre Sorhus</a> as they all seem very high quality. I have already installed, <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/today\">Today</a> to put my calendar in my menu bar (menu bar all the things) and also <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/actions\">Actions</a> to extend Shortcuts abilities. I have a feeling that I might be going all out on customising my Mac currently so I hope you don’t mind me sharing what I find along the way.</p>\n",

First whilst researching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M6bIeVbCqA&amp;t=20s\">improvements for my productivity</a>, and I then watched a video on simple Mac that he thinks <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkYNdy-Hig4\">are underrated</a>.</p>\n<p>Two stuck out straight away for me and I have been using them ever since. They are Shottr and Latest, both of which combined to produce <a href=\"/2023/01/03/i-always-enjoy.html\">this post</a> yesterday when the new micro.blog Mac app update came out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shottr\">Shottr</h2>\n<p>I really love <a href=\"https://cleanshot.com/\">Cleanshot x</a>, it offers more options but it’s also £30. Whereas <a href=\"https://shottr.cc/\">Shottr</a> is completely free and gets you 80% of the way there. With powerful keyboard shortcuts, the option to include backgrounds and also mark up your screenshots, it’s outstanding that you get all this for free.</p>\n<p>It also has built in OCR and you can blur out text without blurring the rest of the image, which helps when you share as many screenshots as I do.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d38192e7c4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"latest\">Latest</h2>\n<p>For all the apps you have installed from outside the App Store, Latest offers a nice update interface. Instead of setting each app to check for updates and call home every so often, you can turn these all off and just check <a href=\"https://max.codes/latest/\">Latest</a> once a week or so.</p>\n<p>The reason that app is so appealing is the awkward updates that seem to pop up when you are trying to do something, and this simple app puts you back in control. It will present all updates in an essay to understand interface and even pull in all the information such as descriptions and changelogs.</p>\n<p>I hope that these two <strong>free</strong> apps can be as helpful to you as they are to me. I am always on the lookout for new things to make my Mac better considering how much time I spend sat at it so I will keep posting new things I find.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>A couple of days ago I wrote a <a href=\"/2023/01/02/can-we-try.html\">link post</a>, the same as I have done hundreds of times before. Found an article online somewhere, read it, picked out a few things that stuck out and threw them into Apple Notes. I typed out my thoughts on the couple of highlighted areas and published these to my blog.</p>\n<p>No more thought was put into this than I have put into every other link post I have ever published. Unless I am specifically subscribed to the author, I have absolutely no knowledge any further than the post I consume, or perhaps some supporting links they post in said article. However, this linked post I published happened to be by someone who has some <a href=\"https://www.glaad.org/gap/jesse-singal\">terrible ideas about trans individuals</a>, and this was only pointed out to me yesterday evening.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, this was by the excellent podcaster Alex Cox (you can see the replies on the <a href=\"/2023/01/02/can-we-try.html\">post</a>) making me more aware of the person I was linking to. To be clear, these ideas are not in the post I liked to, I just read a post talking about ancient aliens and thought the ideas surrounding disagreement were poignant in the current climate. However, this doesn’t stop me feeling terrible about it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/009e3813ba.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>As soon as I received the reply, I began to worry and think about what I should do. My heart was absolutely in the right place, and I immediately wanted to make sure I have done the right thing. I think it is OK to separate some ideas from the person who has them, but at some point publishing online I do have a certain responsibility, even with the tiny platform that I have. It would break my heart that someone would find this person through my post and then consume other terrible posts and ideas.</p>\n<p>Let’s just say I didn’t sleep much last night thinking about this, but I decided in the end to keep the post up, but with a clear disclaimer at the top. I believe the post still stands up on its own. I hope people understand that I read this at face value, however I genuinely understand how it could read if you are aware of the backstory (which I was clueless about).</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>It’s been a <a href=\"/2021/11/30/my-focus-mode.html\">little over a year</a> since I wrote about setting up iOS focus modes. At the time, it was a new feature in iOS15 and one that felt far from ready for release. The confusing UX and complicated options lead to my conclusion that hardly any people would use the feature. Now 13 months on, my feelings have changed very little. Improvements <em>have</em> been made, but the hoops you have to jump through, and the missing features, mean that Focus Modes on all Apple devices still suck.</p>\n<p>Overall, the experience of trying to set up your Focus Modes feels like it was designed by an engineer. That the team designing this already expects you to understand how to use it, with little to no onboarding or instructions. This isn’t unique to Focus Modes, Apple still struggles to communicate the intricacies of its software and even <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608\">the help guides online</a> expect you to already have a large knowledge of the feature you need help with.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2ba730ec9e.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I did get a little too excited when iOS16 introduced a way for apps to tap into the new focus modes. Namely, Apple Mail can now make certain accounts show at certain times, but with there still being no “everything else” Focus Mode, you can’t make your work email <em>only</em> show in a work Focus Mode. It will still be displayed when there is no Focus mode active.</p>\n<p>This wouldn’t be an issue, I could just create a focus mode that is active when not at work and hack around this. Except that an icon appears at the op of my screen constantly, and the sync between devices is still all or nothing. Apple really needs to spend some time thinking about how these modes work and how normal people might use them. I love the fact I can have my phone be different things at different times, but the designers haven’t thought about what happens the rest of the time.</p>\n<p>Having Focus Modes is better than nothing. The improvements are moving in the right direction, but setting them up and understanding everything falls well short of the mark I expect.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Sounds simple, doesn’t it. Everyone who’s used the web knows what a blog is. They <em>were</em> the web for a very long time, before all this social media nonsense kicked off, and there’s a very <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging\">real push</a> for more people to start them. The belief is that you have to have something to write about, or you need a special set of skills, but in reality you don’t need anything.</p>\n<p>Well, you require a way to do it, and thankfully there are loads of options out there, many of them free, but this post isn’t about that. The trouble comes with what to put on your blog, and that’s where it’s important to remember what a blog is. It’s a web log. It’s there for you to ‘log’ anything you want. From thoughts and ideas, to life lessons and photos from vacations. There should be no worry about the what or the why of what you put on your blog.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f8ee75f4f5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>You don’t need to start a website. Nor do you need to <a href=\"https://www.nitinkhanna.com/dont-moleskine-your-blog/\">moleskin the posts</a> you put there. You just need to take all the output you would usually give to a social network for free and put it on your blog. That’s why services like micro.blog, Tumblr or WordPress plugins like social sharing are the best place to start. You can share your blog to wherever you want, but keep control of everything you do.</p>\n<p>There’s a higher, more preachy post on owning your content in here somewhere, too. One that urges you to get to grips with blogging to make the web a better place, but all you need to worry about is having a blog. Using it for whatever you want to use it for, and making sure you carry on sharing with the web. What is a blog is a question with numerous unique answers, but the reality is that a blog is <strong>you</strong>.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I really was. Despite not feeling very well, and not due to New Year&rsquo;s Eve for once, I wanted to publish something today. Not because I had much to say, but because I am on a bit of a roll lately and have found that the act of wanting to write something usually pushes something into my mind.</p>\n<p>This is in stark contrast to my thoughts a few months ago, where I chose to keep quiet unless I had <a href=\"/2021/11/19/something-to-say.html\">something to say</a>. However, I have found that my motivation needs a bit of a prod even now and again. Taking some advice from James Clear in <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780735211292\">Atomic Habits</a> (<a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"https://chrishannah.me/success-is-a-lagging-indicator/\">via Chris Hannah</a>) sometimes I have to want to be a writer and take on a writer&rsquo;s identity to actually do some writing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bbfc93e351.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Instead, I just fixed loads of bugs in my blog, wrote an <a href=\"/about/me/\">about me page</a> and played around with my writing environment. I’ve been a long-time user of Ulysses and have been feeling the itch to move to something new. Doing the usual thing of <a href=\"/2021/03/19/looking-for-my.html\">downloading every app going</a>, realising that Ulysses is the best one for me again, and instead messing with my theme to make it look new. A new lick of paint seems to have done the trick for now at least.</p>\n<p>Hence, this post started out as a test to see whether I liked the new theme or not. So in a round about way I did what I set to do, just not in the way a ‘proper writer’ should do. Or maybe they do, fart about and do other things until inspiration hits them? I have no idea, but getting things done in your own way doesn’t really matter as long as the thing gets done — and I had fun doing it.</p>\n",

				"title": "Manual Practices To Help With Digital Task Lists",
				"content_html": "<p>Following my link post <a href=\"/2022/12/31/i-really-want.html\">talking about bullet journals,</a> I received quite a few replies. Many from those that have, like me, tried and failed to use physical tools, but some from advocates. One <a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"https://micro.blog/ChrisJWilson/15588407\">worth noting was from sketch noter Chris Wilson</a>, and <a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"/replies/2022/12/31/15588729.html\">my response</a> was something I wanted to expand on.</p>\n<p>I have come to terms with the fact that, despite my love of physical things, digital tools suit me better. I always have one <a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"/2022/11/18/apple-watch-ultra.html\">on my wrist</a>, in my pocket, or I am sat at my desk. This is not for want of trying. In January, each year, I buy a diary, accompanied by some new notebooks, and throw myself in again. Only to fail sometime in the next month and go back to Apple Reminders. I don’t have a super stressful job that requires me to project manage or anything in depth, but I have numerous tasks that fall onto my desk each day.</p>\n<p>What I have noticed from this cycle of trying is that without conscious thought, digital tools can be just as bad as physical ones. The expectation is that these intelligent apps will somehow make sure we get everything done, when in fact there is the same risk of a pile up of tasks that will never be checked off. There is no magic app that will get things done for you, and I’ve tried them all, you <em>have</em> to put the work in too.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2024/6ffe42324c.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h2>Reviewing</h2>\n<p>One of the most beneficial practices from bullet journaling is having to copy tasks over to the new day. Keeping things in your mind and making sure they are completed on time. The best way to do this digitally is by scheduling in at least a weekly review of all your tasks. I do this as the first thing in my calendar every Monday. Reviewing each task in my lists, the steps I follow are:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>making sure everything that <em>has</em> to be done has a due date</li>\n\t<li>nothing is in my inbox</li>\n\t<li>tasks that do not have a due date after 4 weeks are given one or deleted</li>\n\t<li>all tasks are scheduled around other calendar appointments</li>\n\t<li>calendar blocks are put in for all tasks that require <a href=\"/2021/11/10/going-deeper.html\">deep work</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This practice is easy to dismiss, but from experiences if you do not take time to address all the things expected of you, then things will be missed. Tasks will end up gathering digital dust without due dates. You will begin to struggle to remember when and if tasks need completing or if you have already done them. Without being mindful of the tasks you have, you <em>will</em> forget things and not get as much done.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2024/16819e96a2.jpg\"/></figure>\n<h2>No Exceptions</h2>\n<p>Everything needs to go in one place, no exceptions, no excuses and no forgetting! If you have one book to write everything in, then you <em>must</em> have one app to do the same. There is no perfect app and to be honest, most people will suffice with whatever app is pre-installed on your phone. Apple Reminders is my favourite app to use because it works with Siri. I find it hugely beneficial to ask Siri to do it rather than tapping through options, or even having to pull out my phone.</p>\n<p>This isn’t a pitch for a specific app, far from it. It’s more of a plea to pick something and stick with it. A <a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"/2019/07/29/a-new-productivity.html\">new app won’t help you get things done</a>, but a better system will. I have to use <a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"/2020/05/18/how-i-use.html\">Todoist for work tasks</a> currently, but this will be stopping in the new year thankfully. However, even if you want to use one app for work and one for home to separate things, this is still an easy way to work.</p>\n<p>There are many things that physical todo lists excel in and there is no getting around it. If you really want to get things done, you have to put in some effort too. Expecting an app to save you without putting in the work is a shortcut to failing.</p>\n",

However, this has led to considerable personal growth.</p>\n<p>My son has been working really hard on his confidence and social skills since going to secondary school. Lucie has been developing her own way of communicating with us all, despite not being able to talk. We have a lot to be thankful for, despite the slight uphill nature of this year.</p>\n<p>My wife and I had a very long conversation about the stresses of Christmas once we had both sat down after lunch. The expenditure and organisational stress often gets on top of us, but we are always aware of the need to recognise what we have to be happy for. Christmas is always a stressful time, and even if the day goes perfectly to plan, which it rarely does, you always wonder if you’ve done enough. We all feel this external pressure to present Christmas as this perfect little event and put too much on ourselves to make the day perfect.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/481ad61dc1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Life isn’t like the movies and TV shows though. The trickster element of the universe loves to throw a spanner or two in there to keep you on your toes. However, rarely do we realise that there is absolutely no need for Christmas to be like you see elsewhere. Everyone’s Christmas is the same as yours, regardless of <a href=\"/2021/05/31/insides-vs-outsides.html\">what they present it as</a>. They are all chaotic, stressful and a long way from perfect, so there’s no point worrying about it.</p>\n<p>No one will lay on their deathbed and wonder why that one a Christmas we had wasn’t flawless. They will be happy that we were all together, or as together as possible, and grateful with it. They all come in different shapes and sizes with their ups and down, so enjoy them while you can. Merry Christmas to all this that celebrate, and wonderful tidings to those that don’t.</p>\n<p>Whatever you’re up to at this time of year, I hope you enjoy it. ❤️</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I usually pick something that I want to focus on for the coming year. The past couple have gone by in a blur of COVID and other issues so I haven’t put as much attention towards them as I’d like. Last year, I wanted to watch more films as a way of getting back my attention and returning to a lost love, but I failed miserably. This year I am picking something more important to me than ever before, I feel like I’m getting old, so my theme this year is <strong>slower</strong>.</p>\n<p>I have always given myself <a href=\"/2022/07/27/210805.html\">a hard time</a> for resting and relaxing, even though it’s an essential part of life. Feeling as if I am wasting my time by <a href=\"/2022/07/31/gaming-life-level.html\">playing games</a> or simply doing nothing, but it is making me ill. Since <a href=\"/2022/10/06/morning-for-a.html\">my serious health issues</a> of early 2022 I have begun creeping back into my old ways of being constantly on the move and not giving myself time to recover. As I published before “Stillness is the only indicator of when I am really ill” but that will be no more.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5e6a8969e2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I need to give myself space to breathe and be alone with my thoughts more often. Leading to better decisions, retaining more information and much less mental stress. Far from being lazy, I have already discovered that slowing down actually allows me to do be more active when I need to be and achieve more whilst doing it. I have plans next year to finally run my return marathon, so I will need all the rest and recuperation I can get, but this slowness goes much deeper than just giving my body time to recover.</p>\n<p>By being slower at everything, the quality of what I am doing will improve, whether that be designing something at work or writing a blog post. It will save me work in the long run in revisions and correcting silly mistakes. Moving fast and breaking things only goes so far. The last thing I want to do is break myself, and in 2023 slowness is the key.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>When users first log into Mastodon after fleeing Twitter, I can almost guarantee that this is one of their first thoughts. The “Social networking that&rsquo;s not for sale” didn’t aim to be the detox drug for those seeking to ween themselves off the bird site, but despite its claims to be radically different, it offers the perfect replacement. Mastodon doesn’t work as well though, and that’s a good thing.</p>\n<p>There’s just no getting around the fact that Mastodon looks and feels very much like Twitter. So much so that many people expect to be able to treat it the same and wonder why some features are missing. With the introduction of apps like <a href=\"https://social.lol/@ivory@tapbots.social\">Ivory</a>, the excellent app from Tweetbot maker <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/\">Tapbots</a> that is still in alpha phase, this likeness becomes even more apparent. In fact, <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@birchtree/109553943240120054\">some users</a> have only begun to use Mastodon because of these similarities. The ways in which it differs though is an important part of the service, and something that a lot of thought goes into.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3f25069f7c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>One of the biggest sticking points is still onboarding and the need to choose a server to join. Granted, most people sign up for one of the largest instances mastodon.social, simply because it comes up top for a Google search of Mastodon. However, joining through the correct channels will mean making a choice, and this is introducing friction in order for the user to put in some thought. Which instance you join is actually important, you will get the most from Mastodon by joining like-minded people, although it is <a href=\"/2022/12/02/moving-my-mastodon.html\">effortless to move</a>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the best example of these intentional barriers is the inability to add a comment to boosting a post, the Mastodon version of a re-tweet. This is <a href=\"https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/14597\">intentionally missing</a> to avoid the usual use of dunking on someone, and also encourage interaction. It doesn’t take a lot to be able to achieve a similar result by copying a link to the post and sharing, but adds in just the right amount of friction to put you off. Hopefully allowing enough time for you to think twice about your action, and perhaps decide better of it.</p>\n<p>By adding in <a href=\"/2019/12/17/intentional-barriers.html\">intentional barriers</a> to certain parts of the social media experience, Mastodon nurtures what it feels is a better experience overall. Decentralisation is a big part of this, but also with the way the service works. Encouraging interaction and conversation, along with a completely chronological timeline, makes Mastodon a fundamentally better place to be than attention economy driven social media. It might seem ‘worse’ but it’s better for you all round.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I’ve had enough of reading and listening about Twitter as the next person. So much so I’ve muted the words on Mastodon, and it has removed almost all trace of it. However, I get it. I still can&rsquo;t help myself reading every new post that crosses my attention, and I know why we all feel the need to talk about what is going on over at the bird site — because it hurts us all.</p>\n<p>In no small part, I owe a lot of my career to Twitter. When I first signed up I didn’t understand it at all, but quickly found loads of new people to follow and out of it grew my love of technology. First by getting in deep to the jailbreaking scene, hacking the Palm Pre, and then later on I was in to Android in a big way. I was motivated to learn, write and interact with people I met all over the world. For some strange reason, my followers swelled to thousands and some of them even took me seriously and one point!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/175966a1af.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Due to my writing and covering technology, I became the resident tech support at home and in my day job. Eventually leaving my sales job to do what I loved full time. All the skills I have now are because I wanted to do something that I had learnt about on Twitter. Unlock a Galaxy phone using the commend line or testing out some new app and giving design feedback. I went to school for none of the things that make me good at my job now, my school was Twitter and the people I met there.</p>\n<p>That is why the downfall of Twitter hurts so much. I spent years of my life there, having fun, meeting new people and learning things that I would not have found anywhere else. I sense that this is the same for many people I know that have had to leave. Not through force or harassment, but they have left because they cannot support the site any more. We held on as long as we could because of those glory day we all enjoyed, but those days are gone. Twitter is gone, it hurts, but let’s move on together.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Since moving all of my proverbial <a href=\"/2022/12/05/one-contact-point.html\">social media eggs into one basket,</a> it has become obvious that a noisy feed sucks. Don’t get me wrong, there are some gigantic benefits from following everyone from one app, and not doing my usual bounce around several apps to elevate boredom. Unfortunately, I doubt that the best pace for this is micro.blog because it’s making my experience worse.</p>\n<p>Like many users on the service, <a href=\"/2018/01/20/using-microblog-aka.html\">I use micro.blog</a> because it <a href=\"/2021/04/11/time-to-slow.html\">is slow</a>, thoughtful and much quieter than most places on the internet. Currently, Mastodon is the opposite of that ethos, it’s fast-paced, constantly updating and in many ways just like Twitter. Which is fine, I love Mastodon, but the very nature of the service is ruining my one soils away from the noise, and unfortunately, it lacks robust filtering and muting options.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c8e763011e.jpg\" alt=\"Dall -E: illustration of a stressed person with a mobile phone\" title=\"Dall -E: illustration of a stressed person with a mobile phone\"></p>\n<p>This is no slight against the service, there has been absolutely no reason for me to need it until now, I’ve never felt the need to mute or even unfollow anyone before. The only options available for me currently is a timeline with all posts, or one without replies. The saving grace is third-party app Gluon, but this doesn’t carry over into using micro.blog on the web, which I do the majority of the time. To get the best from the environment I am trying to create, I require some filtering or dare I say it, a sorting algorithm.</p>\n<p>I get it, that’s never going to happen. The presumption is that implementing machine learning for sorting your feed and prioritising some posts is always bad. When the truth is that for a truly scalable social platform it should be a priority. It doesn’t have to maximise user engagement or any other trap of the attention economy, it just has to quieten down your feed. It really is <a href=\"/2021/04/22/the-problem-of.html\">a problem of scale</a>. I could quite happily follow hundreds of people on Twitter, but couldn’t even think about that kind of number of any other service.</p>\n<p>I am thrilled that so many people have left Twitter behind, but the increased engagement with Mastodon means I need to find a way to escape every now and again. For now, I believe I will have to split these two services apart again to make sure I can hide away from the noise some of the time.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Yesterday<a href=\"/2022/12/13/my-favourite-reading.html\"> I posted</a> that I had jumped in with the new pricing strategy for Matter and become a <a href=\"https://hq.getmatter.com/patron\">Patron subscriber</a>. Strangely, I thought that most people had heard of this amazing ‘Read it later’ app as it was the new hotness for a while. Following some questions on why I choose to use it and comparisons to other services, I thought I’d cover a the main thing I like about it.</p>\n<p>The app has been a staple on my iPhone and iPad for what seems like forever, and giving back £130 for my free usage and receiving another 3 years of service thrown in is the least I could contribute. First things first, I honestly have no idea why I use it over another service. Not because it isn’t great, but because I haven’t used a whole load of different options and I just enjoy using <a href=\"https://hq.getmatter.com/\">Matter,</a> so never look around. They’re a risk, like with note app, that you can spend too much time moving about and not enough time reading.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2024/cd83a5fb77.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>When it started, Matter had built into it a social side where you could follow friends and see what they were reading and see highlights and comments from them. I really enjoyed this part, and after spending a little over a year helping to <a href=\"https://www.getupnext.com/\">develop Upnext</a> I jumped ship to Matter. Using the free app to save all the content I found around the web to consume later. Matter calls itself “a better reader” and on the surface it is exactly that. You can save links from all over the web, not just articles, and access them later to read in a much better environment.</p>\n<p>The app offers highlighting, commenting, leaving notes on sections you’re interested in, and all the usually expected functions of a reading app. The exceptional side to Matter is that it then combines with everything else to make your consumption of things better. Including an excellent integration with Gmail that pulls newsletters into your subscriptions tab with no interaction needed. This is especially useful for longer editions that I receive from <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/\">Platformer</a> or <a href=\"https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/\">Galaxy Brain</a>.</p>\n<p>I can then highlight and takes notes on the parts that I want to remember later, and send them to wherever it is that I intend to save them. Matter already integrates with note-taking apps like Roam Research, Logseq and Obsidian, but I can also send them straight into <a href=\"/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html\">my Apple Notes system</a> or write about them in Ulysses. More often than not, though, I can archive them into my permanent folder and refer to them later on if needed.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2024/98992a96bc.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>All of this has been free for months, and even when they introduce the Subscription in January you will only pay if you want things like fluid highlighting, note-taking and integrations. It will remain a totally free read it later service with <strong>no ads</strong>. I think this is why I could never see myself using anything else. I love the app, it works well and does even more than I require it too, but I also trust the company. They are not using my consumption data to show me ads or sell it on for a quick profit.</p>\n<p>The company now has a robust business model (it was a bit of a concern before, but I expected a subscription eventually) and see themselves as being around for years to come. There are other services around, I was a long-time user of Pocket, but Matter have built up for me as such it is and will continue to be my most used app. It continues to get better and better and now with even more funding behind it there are exciting time to come.</p>\n",

They show where my thoughts are currently and often what is going on in my life. I enjoy posting, but there is something exposing about hitting publish and your words being there for all to see, but it is one of the best things you can do.</p>\n<p>Everyone does what I do. Except they vent into private chat groups, social media DMs and sometimes on social media itself.

It is more of a realisation of the way that writing in public makes you feel. Embarrassed, sometimes down, but more often than not I feel relief and closure from the words I publish. I sometimes struggle to allow myself to feel the things I do so publicly, but the intrinsic rewards of every post are overwhelmingly positive.</p>\n<p>That is not to imply that i don’t sometimes have to keep <a href=\"/2021/02/11/needing-feedback.html\">a lid on my ego</a>, and think about the reasons I am writing my post — but over the years this has become rare. The reasons I post are because I think that someone out there might read my things and like it, but even if they don’t, I enjoyed doing so in public. Allowing myself to feel exposed and ensure the things that I may otherwise have shared privately are indeed correct. There is nothing like shining a light on your thoughts and ideas to let you know where the cracks in them are.</p>\n<p>I might regret it in the future when the robot overlords take over, but it&rsquo;s all I’ve known for more than a decade and I love it.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>There are a few unsolvable questions in my life. What iPhone will I actually use? Which read it later service is the best one? Will I ever stop changing notes apps and actually write some notes? Perhaps the biggest ones revolve around social media. I haven’t been <a href=\"/2018/05/25/intentional-twitter-usage.html\">happy with my usage of it</a> for years, but still as yet can’t find a solution.</p>\n<p>This is frankly a ridiculous issue to have, but my feeling on Social Media boil down to my relationship with Twitter. I love it, well perhaps loved is the better word. The microblogging service has meant I have met some really awesome people that have become close friends, but has also ruined my attention span and <a href=\"/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html\">given me a boredom avoidance crutch</a> for too long. I am in many ways thankful the billionaire baby ruined the experience, so I could fully leave. Since then, I have spent <a href=\"/2022/12/01/104000.html\">too much time worrying about</a> where to spend my time.</p>\n<p>I still found myself bouncing around from app to app when boredom struck, and having too many places to check, transferred my addiction rather than solved it. So, with a great deal of trepidation, I decided to go all in on micro.blog and <a href=\"/2022/12/02/moving-my-mastodon.html\">forward my Mastodon account to it</a>. One app with <a href=\"/2022/12/04/i-am-really.html\">all of my social media usage</a> in it was a risk, there are some massive advantages but also so downsides that I have to think about.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/22b9a2fdca.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"much-calmer\">Much Calmer</h2>\n<p>Although micro.blog uses ActivityPub and allows you to follow any other accounts that use the indieweb protocol, it isn’t Mastodon. As such, there <em>are</em> things that I miss out on. The most obvious being that it doesn’t show boosts. This is a bit of a controversial point on Mastodon, but this removal has actually improved my enjoyment.</p>\n<p>I was one of the people that was calling for Mastodon to introduce boosts with comment, but now I really do understand why it isn’t there, and I really enjoy not having boosts at all. Admittedly, it <em>does</em> cut down on discoverability a bit, but I maintain that good people to follow will always come around. I love the interaction and conversations on Mastodon, and these still show up and allow me to still find new people.</p>\n<p>Using micro.blog I also cannot see any local or federated timelines, so some openness of Mastodon is cut off. The flip side is that I am not lost scrolling through lists and feeds looking for something to entertain, and overall has made me ‘check in’ much less. Only worrying about the last few things that are happening and my mentions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"less-control\">Less Control</h2>\n<p>Being the worrier that I am, giving up control of my one sole access to social media is a bit of a gamble. What if micro.blog were to suffer an issue, or stop working completely? Perhaps they change the way it works by some way I don’t like, or increase the pice by an untenable amount. Much like Twitter, micro.blog is controlled by one person who makes all the decisions, but I trust <a href=\"https://www.manton.org\">Manton</a> a lot more than I trust Musk.</p>\n<p>Being a smaller used service, there is not the choice of apps that there are for Mastodon. Although everything is open source, the demand does not facilitate numerous apps being created. The official app is fine, but this is something to be aware of when you’re all in on a service. It could be worse, I could be forced to use the WordPress app!</p>\n<h2 id=\"diversity-of-followers\">Diversity Of Followers</h2>\n<p>Having used micro.blog on and off for years, I am aware that the people who make up its user base tend not to be very diverse (with exceptions of course). The barrier to entry of the service tends to mean that the topics discussed are very cyclical and insular in nature. Whereas Mastodon is the opposite. Although a little nerdy to understand, I have found a far more diverse set of people to follow than I ever did on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Making sure that this exists is an important way for me to gain a wide range of opinions on topics. By adding in Mastodon, I feel this is much easier to achieve, although I do feel as if this may be harder going forward given my inability to browse timelines and not see all posts. However, by being mindful of this, I should avoid building myself an echo chamber.</p>\n<h2 id=\"removal-of-the-social-media-trappings\">Removal Of The Social Media Trappings</h2>\n<p>Using micro.blog also removed all the follower counts and social media shenanigans that taint any service. Granted, Mastodon does not use ranking algorithms and the like, but does have hashtags that are gamed and some users that yearn for attention. This is all stripped away on micro.blog and Manton has been <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2018/11/07/microblog-mastodon.html\">clear</a> that he will continue down this line. In his words, “compatibility with Mastodon lets us support the good things that Mastodon has accomplished, while still carrying forward what, I think, are the unique strengths of Micro.blog.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"lack-of-mute\">Lack Of Mute</h2>\n<p>One part of Mastodon I absolutely loved was the powerful muting. I quickly set up a range of filters that meant politics nor Twitter craziness graced my feed. None of this exists on micro.blog bar muting users. I have hope that perhaps this will improve in the future, however as yet I have not seen any of this. I have a feeling that boosts may cut a lot of this out, however I will need to keep a real eye on things.</p>\n<p>With all things said it does worry me having one point of contact with all of the social web, but so far I have found it very calming. I have removed the issues surrounding consuming the internet in bit side chunks and calmed down my feed. How long this confidence lasts will be interesting but at the moment is has been a good decision. I own all of the content I put out now and it is all on one place, syndicated to wherever I want it to.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Several people still point to <a href=\"/2021/04/01/how-i-set.html\">my older post</a> on how I post to my blog using automation. Unfortunately, some of these Shortcuts no longer work or can be done better, so I decided to update them. Here’s all the Shortcuts I use to publish and use micro.blog to help you automate your life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"microblog-post-search\">Micro.blog Post Search</h2>\n<p>I love linking my posts together and making sure I reference and expand on previous thoughts. The easiest way to do this is to search on micro.blog for the old posts, and you can do this with one tap.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e6c3cfa50e.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Grab the Shortcut <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/81a80d6045d641978c9a4a625b382913\">here</a>, and change the text to your account ID number found by doing a post search and getting the numbers after <code>/posts/</code>and before <code>?q</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"image-upload\">Image Upload</h2>\n<p>For those that include images in your posts and want to upload them beforehand, they usually lean on <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696\">Mimi uploader</a>. An excellent third-party app that helps you do this with one image or full albums of them. However, this Shortcut will do all that for you if you do not need the graphical front end.</p>\n<p>Grab it <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ec0296b20f9041daa60abceb634bccd7\">here </a>and place your app token in the top text box. Once run, this will ask you to select the images you want to upload and then ask of the alt text of them. Once done, you will have the Markdown syntax for all of your images copied to your clipboard.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/26a3643377.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"post-to-microblog\">Post To Microblog</h2>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fa9fa172631740c1a124eb34e2d01d0b\">basic Shortcut</a> forms the backbone of other ones I have built for my posting style. However, it comes in very useful if you want to post from apps that don’t support publishing to micro.blog. So, you can turn your simple text editor of choice into a publishing app by sharing the text to this Shortcut.</p>\n<h2 id=\"life-update\">Life Update</h2>\n<p>For the last few weeks, I’ve been using this updated version instead of my <a href=\"/2022/10/17/how-i-use.html\">status.lol Shortcut</a> with all the updates of my life. Mine is a pretty boring one, but the Shortcut has allowed me to post things effortlessly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f3c8fc2be0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Grab it <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d5d12d9b2ced48afaedd4d81894e1841\">here</a></p>\n<p>I made this modular this time so that other Shortcuts I made can be used. This makes both making the Shortcut and understand what is going on easier. You will need the image upload shortcut, the post to micro.blog shortcut and the omg.lol status Shortcut shown above.</p>\n<p>Once saved to my Homescreen I can post a feeting status or a more permanent post to micro.blog. I use this multiple times a day to share <a href=\"/categories/micro/\">micro posts</a> and some of <a href=\"/photos/\">my photography</a>.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Well, first things first. I am not really moving my Mastodon account to micro.blog in the technical sense but rather forwarding everything, but if you’re reading this you want to do the same. Thankfully, the process is pretty easy, and you won’t need much knowledge to do it.</p>\n<p>The reason I wanted to do this, is that I can follow Mastodon accounts (or any other ActivityPub service) from inside micro.blog and didn’t see the point using two apps to do the same things. I went <a href=\"/2022/11/30/shortcut-find-mastodon.html\">backwards and forwards</a> on which way I was going to do this, and <a href=\"/2022/12/01/snacking-on-the.html\">decided that a quieter timeline</a> on micro.blog was the way I wanted to go. My only concern was leaving my other Mastodon account on <a href=\"https://social.lol/\">social.lol</a> empty and losing the people that I follow.</p>\n<p>I first created an <a href=\"/2022/11/30/shortcut-find-mastodon.html\">iOS Shortcut</a> to find the accounts that I wanted to follow on micro.blog. For more information about following ActivityPub accounts on micro.blog check out the help docs <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/activitypub/95\">here</a>. I gave this a day or so to see if this was the way I wanted to go, and then went all in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"microblog-alias\">Micro.blog Alias</h2>\n<p>On micro.blog head to Account &gt; ActivityPub and click set Mastodon compatible username. The default for this is your micro.blog username, so mine would be <code>@gr36@micro.blog</code> I changed this to one using my custom url and to keep things nice and simple I chose <code>@greg@gr36.com</code>. Once you have done this, your username will appear in a box at the top of the page, next to this click Aliases.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9cb404633a.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Here, you add in your ‘old’ Mastodon account that you want to transfer followers from and forward all traffic. You can add multiple aliases here if you need to.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mastodon-move\">Mastodon Move</h2>\n<p>On your Mastodon instance, head to Settings &gt; Account and towards the bottom you will see Move to a different account. Here you need to add in your new micro.blog Mastodon compatible username, and then put in your password.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/024480d6ca.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I would like to point out that you can only migrate once every 30 days, and that the process may take a while to complete. All of your followers will be moved across to the micro.blog account and if anyone replies to your ‘old’ account this will also show up in micro.blog.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/eb021f290d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Although you <em>can</em> unlink these if you want to open your account back up again, I have not tested this. I have no idea if your followers or content come back again, so consider this destructive, unless you find out otherwise and please let me know.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Due to the billionaire baby, I’ve been thinking far too much about social media. I can see no end to the news coverage of Twitter or the various escapades on Elmo, and other platforms are just revolving conversations of the same. Mastodon feels like you’re spending time with a begrudged ex that won’t talk about anything else. As such, those topics bleed through into my thoughts, into my writing and seemingly into every part of my life.</p>\n<p>Woe betide anyone who brings up Twitter in real life, you will get schooled on my latest thoughts and wish you ever asked! When I published the latest in my long line of posts about social media this morning, I considered I might have a problem on my hands. In my effort to get away from the subject, I am actually making matters worse and perhaps thinking about it too much when in reality it doesn’t matter.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c115c3a7b1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>To any normal person, it is a pretty easy decision on social media platforms. Use it or not. The conversation or thoughts on the subject go no further. Yet in my internet riddle brain I must way up where people are, who is using the service and then worry about whether it is good for me or not. I wholly blame Twitter for this. Never in the history of humankind have so many users hated being in a place, but not been able to help being drawn back to it. What I must consider is that those unique ambivalent feelings probably won’t exist again.</p>\n<p>My thoughts about social media go deeper than they should. In many respects, that is a good thing. Spending some time considering where you place your time is a practice missing from most people’s lives. It can go too far, though. I spend too much time thinking and writing about Twitter that I might as well use it. I am not looking for some self gratification that my decision to leave was right, as most of Mastodon seem to be. Yet, social media is too often occupying my brain when I have better things to write about.</p>\n",

The feelings of worry that have all but disappeared are a by product of not being plugged into the attention economy, but I’m still not convinced I am getting the best possible results. My attachment to Mastodon has meant that I am still consuming the internet in bite sized chunks and far too often.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that my new favourite place to hang out is a really nice place to be. Due to the platform not being invested in maximising my time on site, users do not have the worst of the platform shoved in their face. The content is not really an issue, but the snack sized updates feel like I have not moved on. I have theorised that perhaps the constant scroll has associated itself in my brain with a worry state. The sheer fact that I am consuming the internet in the same shallow moving state is also causing me issues.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5e0b259edf.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>At the end of the day, any social network site is a distraction. Granted, sometimes I need those, but more often than not I don’t. Mastodon is great, but ultimately suffers from the same issues as Twitter due to the humans using it. Consuming the internet in a giant feed of updates will eventually fall into the same traps, and I’m not convinced it&rsquo;s good for my brain. It doesn’t matter where those updates are, or <a href=\"/2022/11/30/shortcut-find-mastodon.html\">where I follow along</a> with them, it will still be a tool for my monkey brain to get its fix.</p>\n<p>As nice as the place is, I don’t feel like Mastodon is anything more than a replacement. <a href=\"/2022/11/22/learn-your-lesson.html\">Now is the perfect time</a> to consider if the internet should be followed a bit deeper instead through blogs and news sites. Writing more. Sharing and interacting with a bit more care and attention than fleeting updates.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter the words used. A status update is a Toot, is a Tweet, and perhaps I’ve just had enough of all of them? Currently I feel like I’ve escaped an abusive relationship, but I’m hanging around with their slightly nicer identical twin. Sure it’s better, but it’s a bit too familiar.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Despite all the words, the thoughts and the conscious decision to try not to. My monthly challenge of no Twitter for 30 days has not gone as well as it should have. I was hoping to really bring myself around to the idea that I don’t need to be online as much as I am, but instead I’ve just replaced my Twitter scrolling with Mastodon scrolling.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, this is much better for me. There’s no need for me to worry about being led down rabbit holes, or toxic tweets being shoved in my face. Mastodon has no motivation to maximise the time I spend engaged, but it’s still worse than nothing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2b6a7b707c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The good news is that I feel much better for not being on Twitter. Despite all the tech news coverage and seemingly everyone talking about it, I have zero motivation to go back to Twitter. The reason for this is pretty easy for me to recognise because a large percentage of people I follow have <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/elon-musk-and-the-worst-people/\">checked out of Twitter too</a>. Helping to curb my feelings of missing out or not being included in conversations.</p>\n<p>When I say I have not been on the website, I truly haven’t and that’s the first time in a long while. When I’ve had similar time away, I’ve always checked in a little. Scrolled thought friends profiles without being logged in or had a <a href=\"/2021/07/09/a-quick-check.html\">look to see what’s happening</a>. What I have done though is replaced my <a href=\"/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html\">Twitter muscle memory</a> with Mastodon. Reaching for boredom relief is still built into my subconscious instead of just embracing the boredom.</p>\n<p>Overall, this is a step in the right direction though. Despite not really <a href=\"/2022/11/25/this-may-just.html\">seeing the point in sharing</a> so much any more, Mastodon has given me the fix I needed to pull myself away from doom scrolling Twitter. I need to give a massive thank you to the billionaire baby for finally ruining Twitter to a point I don’t care any more. Cheers!</p>\n",

I set up some online hosting, and cobbled together an HTML website from a theme, and then when I posted something I would duplicate a page and link it up on the man index, all manually. No research done, no WordPress, I had no clue. All I knew was that I wanted to publish online and be a writer, and it wasn’t <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130610095709/http://gr36.com/\">until 2013</a> that I really sorted myself out and began to publish properly.</p>\n<p>Due to this desire, I wrote about my thoughts about technology on my blog and then posted the links to Facebook and Twitter. I am so glad that I went this way and have almost all of my posts as a record instead of pouring all of my time into social media. Although I have no idea what started this motivation, the last few weeks have proven that more and more people should be doing the same and <a href=\"/2021/03/22/the-value-of.html\">putting some value</a> into the things they put on the internet.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/daa551975c.jpg\" alt=\"My first WordPress Blog From June 2013\"></p>\n<p>In this time of turmoil and possible migration, don’t just fall into the same trap and do the same with Mastodon, or wherever you end up. There are some great services out there now that can provide you with a <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/pricing/19\">cost-effective</a> way to turn your would be <a href=\"https://www.patrickrhone.net/4480-2/\">tweet storms into blog posts</a> to make them yours, forever. I am a little bias towards micro.blog because, although not perfect, it offers you a great way to get started and start posting everything to one place.</p>\n<p>My true hope with all this Twitter nonsense is that people start moving away from social media apart from for real communication, and that more thangs get published online. Blogging isn’t about putting 300+ words together in a nice little package and choosing the right images to go along with it. It can be anything you want it to be, your blog and your posts are your own and don’t need to conform to anyone else’s rules.</p>\n<p>You will hear many blog supporters discuss ownership, the indieweb and even internet standards when getting preachy about having a blog. None of these really matter to most people, the real reason you need a blog is to showcase you. To have your little place online that isn’t affected by algorithms and billionaire babies. It’s just yours.</p>\n",

				"title": "Apple Watch Ultra: This Isn’t Supposed To Be For Me",
				"content_html": "<p>I distinctly remember watching this year&rsquo;s Apple event and being interested in absolutely nothing new. The yearly even that temps me into spending massive sums of money didn’t come across as well as usual. Most of the improvements were software anyway. Despite my bank balance thanking me, I felt a bit flat that I wouldn’t be picking up my usually iPhone and Apple Watch combination ready for my birthday in a couple of weeks time.</p>\n<p>How wrong could I have been. Just a couple of months later, I am sat typing this out with an iPhone 14 Pro in my pocket and the most surprising hit of the year, an Apple Watch Ultra on my wrist. Whilst I like the iPhone, I would give it up with very little thought if I had too, however no one is taking this watch away from me now, and that shouldn’t be the case.</p>\n<p>All of the Apple marketing tells me this watch is not for people like me. Sure I am relatively fit, despite health issues stopping me from running much, and I do like the outdoors. This watch is supposed to be for those that are levels above me. Divers, rock climbers, ultra distance runners, it’s not supposed to be for full-time dads and office workers, but here we are. All the improvements are just as useful in everyday life as they are for those Apple aim it at, and I adore it.</p>\n<p>That’s it, review over. There are enough people out there that will walk you through specs and all the things that it can do, unfortunately I lack the ability to express the boring bits well and answer those types of questions you may have. What I can do though is tell you why and how this helps me in my daily life and hopefully help you see where it <em>could</em> be useful to you. This is pretty easy because there are not many areas that make a difference, but they add up to something that most people should consider.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/08bec90030.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"battery-life\">Battery Life</h2>\n<p>Presentations and marketing never give a true reflection of the type of usage you will get from Apple devices. They are pretty spot on, but no-one does the things they highlight. They don’t watch video playback on a MacBook Pro for 18 hours straight, and most people won’t be doing <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-watch-ultra/\">60 hours worth of exercise</a> (low-power mode required). It’s even hard to work out what battery life would actually be like when comparing to the ‘regular’ Apple Watches “all day” but the Ultra will easily see you through three days.</p>\n<p>I loose around 25% per 24 hours, including sleep tracking and at least one workout. Although occasionally, it seems to plummet at twice that rate until I reboot, which is bound to be something software related. Is this the best battery life on the market, no. Is this anything compared to a Garmin watch for example, no again. It is the best Battery life in an Apple Watch to date, and this means less to worry about.</p>\n<p>The only ‘downside’ is that charging takes quite a while. Using a supported fast charger, it can get you from 25% ish up to 50+ in 30 mins, but it takes a while to top it up to full. I have mediated this by charging it most days for 30 minutes or so while I have a shower and get sorted for the day. This sees the battery life hover around 80-50% constantly and suits me much better than having to charge it for 90-minutes or so every few days.</p>\n<p>I am over the moon with the improvements to battery life of the Apple Watch Ultra. I wear it constantly, use if for <a href=\"/2022/10/30/so-ive-finally.html\">phone free days out</a>, and in my testing when I was trying to see how far it would get me I only lost 12% after 5 hours of hard use. If you&rsquo;re like me and want to be contactable, still be able to make payments and other modern things, but <a href=\"/2022/02/10/the-ultimate-minimalist.html\">don’t want a phone around all the time</a>, the Apple Watch Ultra is the perfect device.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/22abfc4284.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"size--design\">Size &amp; Design</h2>\n<p>When I first thought about getting the Apple Watch Ultra was when people I knew began to receive them and use them. Sure, I’d seen the glossy images in press reviews and seen a few in video reviews, but once they were all over social media my opinions changed. The design that I thought was chunky and horrible, actually looked much better ‘in-person’. When compared to larger Casio watches the Apple Watch Ultra looks much nicer, to me at least.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is all subjective. You may look at the raised lip to the flat screen, coupled with the crown guard, and think yuck. Some of my desire was just motivation to have something else, anything else, than the Apple Watch I had been wearing for years, but the Ultra version looks really impressive and feels great on my wrist. Even my tiny wrists. Seriously, I have to buy Size 6 braided loops and a S/M in the Orange Alpine Strap as seen in almost all press shots (it is nice though).</p>\n<p>The great thing about the new design is that it doesn’t scream smartwatch. It’s obvious that it is one if you’re paying attention, but from everyday life, to the boardroom, the design looks more like a watch than the original design. The chunky design is not for everyone, and in fact more stylish watch brands are going the offsite way and slimming down, but it looks much better than the press photos would have you believe.</p>\n<h3 id=\"comfortable\">Comfortable</h3>\n<p>The weird thing about this watch is, despite the increase in size, and it is a big watch, it&rsquo;s far more comfortable than other versions. The heart rate sensor doesn’t seem to push itself into my wrist as much, and the increased width makes the straps pull around my wrist rather than down. With the increased battery life, I tried sleeping in it, which I rarely did with the old one, and was surprised how comfortable it is.</p>\n<p>Watch straps are a bit looser when compared with the regular ones, which makes perfect sense given that the watch itself is slightly bigger. This is only obvious with fixed length bands like my favourite braided loops.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rough--ready\">Rough &amp; Ready</h3>\n<p>I have lost count the number of times I have accidentally scraped my watch on a wall, or knocked it on a door frame. Accidents happen in real life and although my sport versions always stood up OK, they always end their time with me with more than a few scrapes and chips. This new titanium version with the robust design gives me the confidence that I don’t have to worry about it. This is one of the great appeals of this watch, yes it can stand up to mountain climbing or whatever, but it will also resist being hit by a ‘ toy or fumbling it off its charger in the dark. It’s outdoor proof and also life proof.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/66b94c8d07.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"useable\">Useable</h3>\n<p>Many of the design changes are due to fitting in a much larger screen. I suppose 49 mm is not that much of a difference from 45, but that’s almost a 10% bump up. The new watchOS 9 exaggerates this further because the OS feels much larger than before, making interaction with the screen much easier. From swiping on the keyboard replying to a message to opening and using a app, it really is surprising what a difference a few mm make on a watch screen.</p>\n<p>The screen is also much brighter when in use. This isn’t something that I noticed when using older versions, only when testing both side by side you do notice the stark difference. Making the screen much easier to see and use, especially when working out, when a quick glance is all you need to see all information on the nice big screen.</p>\n<p>The screen is not the only thing that’s been improved, sure you’ll also get more accurate GPS and a depth sensor, but a massive improvement is the onboard speaker. Making it even more useful in daily life if, like me, you get phone calls at the worst possible time. I’m not saying people on the other end can’t tell they are on speaker, but you can hear them load and clear now whatever you are doing. When phone free, I’ve been making and receiving quite a few calls and the speaker makes a nice change to having to carry around my AirPods just in case.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-love-it\">I Love It</h2>\n<p>All of these things make the Apple Watch Ultra one of the best buys of the last few years. The battery life and small improvements all around have made me think less about it being a smartwatch, and more of a life assistant. I have the confidence it will do whatever I need it to do, whenever I need it. I can go phone free for hours on end as well as stand up to all the stresses and strains of my hectic lifestyle. It comes with me everywhere and I absolute love it.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say that everyone should rush out and buy it. This is a £850 watch, after all. It won’t retain the value like spending the same money on a regular watch would do, and it won’t last nearly as long. However, it can aid your life in some very specific ways that I think plenty of people would enjoy. If you have the opportunity, try one out and see what it can do for you.</p>\n",

Coupled with some nice feedback, has inspired me to publish some more bit sized posts for you to consume.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-happiness-privilege\">The Happiness Privilege</h2>\n<p>I’ve just finished <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781529396508\">Happy, Sexy, Millionaire</a> by Steven Bartlet. It’s a pretty short book that doesn’t fall into the same trap most books with a similar message do and become a series of cherry-picked anecdotal stories. Near the start he discusses his pursuit of happiness, in that he started out with the wrong outlook and gives one of the most important outlooks that I’ve read for a while.</p>\n<p>The premise is to not look for things to make you happy, but look for happiness instead. As he points out, just the sheer contemplation of wanting to change your life to be happy comes from an amazingly privileged place already.</p>\n<p>The fact that you can even dare to think about changing things in your life to be more happy should make you stop and think. There is a massive section of the world that this simply isn’t an option, there is no other process than simply doing whatever they need to survive. We are all in an amazingly privileged place just to be reading this text and thinking about happiness, never forget that. You are already enough.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9c8cf84629.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"quiet-apathy\">Quiet Apathy</h2>\n<p>There’s a general belief that there are only two sides of every argument now. Commentators point to issues like Brexit and vaccinations that the world at large is moving further apart. There’s some truth in this, at least in my anecdotal observations, the world does seem further apart. However, that is because you only hear from both of these extreme sides, and the rest of us don’t care enough.</p>\n<p>Take something like the online discourse around the COVID-19 vaccine. Peruse the online world, and you might think you’re either in the camp that got it as soon as possible, or you&rsquo;re an anti-vaxer. The truth is, the vast majority of people were somewhere in the middle. Positive about the advancements, but prefer a bit of a wait and see mentality. We don’t need to be split into camps, but the reality of the online world is that the other side of the argument is always wrong. Quiet apathy is the way to live life happily, have your opinions but don’t give a damn about other people&rsquo;s versions of them. Bliss.</p>\n<h2 id=\"quote-of-the-week\">Quote Of The Week</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake up in the day to find it was vanity, but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible - T.E. Lawrence</p></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"mastodon-for-companies\">Mastodon For Companies</h2>\n<p>I love the fact that Twitter is burning down. Not for the staff there, I hate that these talented people are without jobs or forced to have one they don’t like. But for the selfish fact it has got me to the stage where my need to visit has diminished, and I feel mush happier about the world.</p>\n<p>The only thing I miss is being able to get in touch with brands. Many seem to prioritise support through Twitter and Facebook (neither of which I use) and sending them a tweet for help is easy to do. With this in mind I wondered what would happen if Twitter imploded, or the brand just didn’t want to be there any more, and I ran through a thought experiment where they all had Mastodon instances.</p>\n<p>It would be straightforward to toot (I still hate that word) at a brand&rsquo;s customer service if they all become universal. For instance, all customer service could be <code>@cs@webaddress</code>, and you wouldn’t need to root around for anything. Amazon order not shown up, just message <code>@cs@amazon.co.uk</code> or had a bad experience in Tesco, reach out to <code>@cs@tesco.co.uk</code>. This opens up the ability to have those individuals who are representative of the brand, or otherwise want to be open to contact to have the ability, or you just have an internal social network too.</p>\n<p>Yes, this relies on everyone understanding Mastodon and there are many that still don’t, but I think it’s a pretty nice idea. Thoughts?</p>\n",

				"title": "Ten Days No Twitter",
				"content_html": "<p>I feel as if I start every post about Twitter with the same words. I both love it and hate it, blah blah blah. Well, this time a billionaire baby annoyed me, so I quit for a bit and then decided to set myself a new monthly challenge. I’m 10 days into “No Twitter November” and I have a few observations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theitch\">The Itch</h2>\n<p>I’ve known for a long while I’ve had a deep-rooted muscle memory <a href=\"/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html\">Twitter itch</a>. Despite all of my attempts, I can’t stop my unconscious brain from grabbing a device and opening Twitter whenever I am bored. I do it without thinking, and often only catch myself after minutes of doom scrolling.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, this has dried up fairly quickly, but I’m not going to lie, the first few days were frustratingly bad. I had to make sure I had signed out everywhere and had no apps installed. The sight of the sign in screen was good enough to jar me back into the real world and stop me from going any further. In the last couple of days it has only happened twice when compared to the first few days occurring a couple of times <em>an hour</em>.</p>\n<p>Using Mastodon a bit more has helped / replaced this, so I feel like I am cheating a bit. However, that place doesn’t give me the same hate filled rage and leave me feeling deflated, so it’s a net win.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thelogged-outexperiencesucks\">The Logged-Out Experience Sucks</h2>\n<p>There are a few newsletters I subscribe to that include some funny tweets, or useful threads to check out. Mostly these show fine, but others require a tap, and if they do, I am usually immediately hit with pop-ups to sign in and “join the conversation”. It sucks that I can’t consume the information logged out, but I expect nothing less.</p>\n<p>I debated log and hard if even reading these tweets constituted cheating, but concluded it didn’t. This was further confirmed given the terrible experience if I’m logged out anyway. Every so often you can see what you need to and the screen is taken over if you scroll down, sometimes you’re blocked entirely. It sucks.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2024/36147889bc.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"75ofmediareliesontwitter\">75% Of Media Relies On Twitter</h2>\n<p>After a few days of no Twitter, I began to see it everywhere. At first, I put this down to some kind of withdrawal, but it soon became obvious how much of the news sites, personal blogs and YouTube were covering things that happened on or about Twitter.</p>\n<p>Granted, this was exaggerated by the baby billionaire doing his best to burn it down. There aren’t many “did you see what happened on Twitter” water cooler moments, but a gigantic percentage of news is about what so-and-so tweeted or other things linked to the service. I now entirely understand why journalists feel like they are chained to checking Twitter. Which leads me to my last point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"imisspeople\">I Miss People</h2>\n<p>There are a few people who have joined me on my jump from Twitter, but many have not. I miss the interaction I got (no matter how small) from people that I’ve met over the years. Reading their life updates and learning new things they are up to.</p>\n<p>Some of this has moved to a group chat, but it doesn’t feel the same. I do miss Twitter when it’s good, and I wish there was some way to make it work, but the longer I spend off the service, the more I realise it is the right thing to do. Perhaps in time I will realise that this space in my brain is better used elsewhere, but presently I miss it. There are a few people that I only interact with on Twitter, so I’ve had to stalk people’s Instagram or find another way to contact them.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I do see myself dipping my toe back in, but perhaps in a much reduced basis. It may take more time to work out the way I am going to gain the little community I had, but I think it can also be built elsewhere too. There’s another 20 days to go, so things might change by then, I’ll let you know.</p>\n",

				"title": "Some Small Thoughts",
				"content_html": "<p>Since ditching my newsletter a while a go, I haven’t really had a place to share smaller thoughts with the world. It was effortless to fill it full of things that took up some space in my brain and perhaps would make a good talking point, but wasn’t worthy of a blog post. So, I’ve decided to publish them every so often anyway and see how it goes. Welcome to some small thoughts I have had over the last week or so.</p>\n<h2 id=\"systems-and-tools\">Systems and tools</h2>\n<p>It doesn’t matter what you are trying to do, the system is the most important thing to get right. Look at what you need to achieve and then work backwards in a realistic step process. Once done, the tools you choose will fall around the system. If you don’t get everything straight, you can fall into the trap of letting the tools dictate the system itself. If a tool I use can’t do the job I want it to do, do I then find a different tool or change my system and expectations?</p>\n<p>The risk is that changing your tools every time is costly, in both time and money, but if a tool doesn’t fit the system or do what you want it to do, it breaks the system. Working out what you <em>really</em> need to achieve is the only way to solve the problem.</p>\n<p>Look at note-taking, for example. Numerous people are told “you need to take notes like this” or “use this app to achieve this specific thing” instead of working out where they must be to make it work. My <a href=\"/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html\">note-taking system</a> was broken for a long time. Not in terms of taking notes, but using the notes later on. Linking between thoughts and surfacing ideas has never worked as well as it thought it should. This made me l<a href=\"/2022/02/15/link-posts-from.html\">ook around constantly</a> for new tools to do this, when in reality when I stopped and thought about it, I never used them anyway.</p>\n<p>Is your system broken, or your tools?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/df3daaec69.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"different-photos-different-places\">Different Photos, Different Places</h2>\n<p>I figured something out last week to do with photo services. I post <a href=\"/2022/10/03/taking-the-shot.html\">different photos</a> to different places. Instagram gets a bit more editing and only a few chosen photos. I usually then posted more natural ones to Glass <a href=\"/2022/08/08/for-the-sake.html\">when I used it</a>, and then I am perfectly happy dumping all the rest on my blog / micro.blog.</p>\n<p>The different places seem to be set up for different things. I would never dream of posting anything personal to Glass. It feels too much like a pro photographer&rsquo;s place to share the best of the best. Like what Instagram should be without all the gaming and attention seeking that plagues an otherwise great platform.</p>\n<p>I sometimes found myself shooting a photo slightly differently, or editing a different version for Instagram. Which often leave me feeling a bit strange. Typically, photos I don’t even like do better on Instagram because they have a similar look and feel to others, but I edit how I like when I post to my blog.</p>\n<h2 id=\"quote-of-the-week\">Quote of the week</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maybe, I need to make peace with the fact that I cannot keep up. I cannot keep up with the growing list of brilliant books. I cannot keep up with the gifted writers churning beautiful essays. And, with a heavy heart, accept that I am okay with it. <a href=\"https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/08/14/no-end-to.html\">No End to Content Overload - Excursions</a></p></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"because-of-instagram\">Because Of Instagram</h2>\n<p>“The modern world is stupid” says every old man who wants to shake his fist confused. Me included. I don’t get most of the business decisions today, and most of the marketing I see is just bizarre. Which is somewhat worrying because that’s what I’m supposed to know about for my day job. I do understand where most of it has come from, and the influence of Instagram cannot be understated.</p>\n<p>There’s a whole world of products and businesses out there built solely because of the instagram effect. They have designed their products, and sometimes entire practices, to appeal to a certain ascetic and sell things to the Instagram (and now TikTok) generation. This isn’t just something that appeals to Gen-Z either. The amount of money that I have spent on experiences and products purely because my wife wants to post to Instagram is more than I care to admit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/750bd0b020.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"an-ode-to-quick-note\">An ode to quick note</h1>\n<p>It took Apple a while, but they finally made Apple notes truly useful on my iPhone. Yes, there are still things they need to improve, like the terrible implementation of rich text, but quick note is a revelation and the cornerstone of everything I need to capture whilst using my phone.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter where I am, <a href=\"/2022/08/02/writing-instead-of.html\">what I am doing</a>, but within seconds I can take a note. By adding a small icon to control centre, and also allowing me to swipe up on the iPad, I’ve turbocharged my note-taking and also saved myself some money. I no longe rely on an app like Drafts, to make sure I can take a quick note — I love Quick note.</p>\n",

				"title": "A Verified Mess",
				"content_html": "<p>Although <a href=\"https://gr36.status.lol/636179534308c\">my monthly challenge</a> forbids me from checking Twitter, my reading stream and other social media is full of Twitter news. I honestly couldn’t care less what the business does, and what Elmo turns his attention on to monetise its user base, but most of the chatter seems to be about blue check marks and paying for subscriptions. Weirdly, I’ve been thinking about this for years and have a few thoughts.</p>\n<p>The main issue is my confusion around what Verified means on Twitter. The word just seems wrong in the context that Twitter puts on it. Never fitting in to any mental model I can come up with. The way in which it is portrayed certainly needs refreshing if not removing, but the blue check already carries its own weight after years of use.</p>\n<p>Verified should mean ‘this person is who they say they are’. In so far as Twitter have carried out some checks, perhaps uploading an ID and placing some code in your website, and as far as they can tell, this person is real. The user is then verified, but it shouldn’t have the importance that Twitter places on it currently.</p>\n<p>To Twitter, Verified means that this person is who they say they are, but they represent the way Twitter wants to portray its service. In as much as, if you don’t conform and break some unwritten rules, the first strike for Twitter is often to remove the user&rsquo;s Verified badge. A weird way to work when you can call the service anything you like, yet chose your marker as ‘Verified’.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/de93a8ad23.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-i-would-fix-verified\">How I Would Fix Verified</h2>\n<p>For years, I have wanted a Twitter pro that is worth paying for. Solving the platform&rsquo;s biggest problem and also gaining some income. Whilst I understand that the way Twitter works, fast-paced and with a massive reach, is its USP. Most of the issues users face is due to bots and anonymous users.</p>\n<p>I feel users should be able to prove who they say they are and get a blue check mark. You shouldn’t <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-reverses-real-names-policy-apologizes/\">be forced to use your name</a> or other downfalls of similar ideas, but Twitter should be able to tell who you are and therefore be answerable for your conduct. As a perk, users can decide to <em>only</em> interact with others that are verified and have robust filtering in place to only see those users. If Twitter wants you to pay, fine, that’s their call, but users need useful features in exchange for money.</p>\n<p>Twitter could then extend this towards other markers for people that represent whatever it is that they mark people as Verified currently. Perhaps a gold checkmark, or a deferent thing all together. This still may not resolve the issues currently plaguing it, nor pull me back, but it would perhaps go some way to addressing the current issues.</p>\n",

There are many more knowledgable about the situation than I, and couple with the fact I don’t care currently, means I stay quiet. That said, the recent moaning makes me think back to the days I used to love Samsung phones and the biggest reason I quit was ads.</p>\n<p>That’s right, dear reader, I once very nearly switch to Samsung around the Galaxy Fold 2 / <a href=\"/2020/10/06/samsung-galaxy-note.html\">Note 20 Ultra</a> era. They were great phones and I enjoyed using them to review, but what put me off in the end was that I felt like I was the product. Adverts would constantly be displayed in Samsung apps, such as Pay. They even went as far as sending notifications and adverts right <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-ads-your-samsung-phone\">in your notification area</a> at some points. All of which completely put me off dealing with the company.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/eccbe0a8d2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If you buy a cheap device, you expect companies to bundle in services and try to push you towards spending more money. You don’t, however, expect this when you spend upwards of £1,200 on a phone like the Fold 2 or Note 20 Ultra. Granted Samsung are possibly the worst offender in this space, and do similar things with their <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/co5aw4/unremovable_ads_on_my_2500_samsung_smart_tv/\">expensive TVs</a>, so we might be comparing Apples to Oranges, but it just feels off.</p>\n<p>I absolutely expect a company to be pushed to make more and more money, and I understand that people have a strange perception of Apple as a whole, but it’s starting to feel a bit weird all of a sudden. There is nothing immediate to worry about, but after years and years of Apple telling us they don’t do adverts and <a href=\"https://gadgets360.com/internet/news/tim-cook-to-google-users-youre-not-the-customer-youre-the-product-594242\">yelling at other companies</a> that treat their <a href=\"https://sigma.world/news/you-are-no-longer-the-customer-you-are-the-product-tim-cook/\">customers as products</a>, it feels like the tide is turning.</p>\n<p>Granted, these are only feelings, ones based on experiences with the worst of the worst, but I understand where some users are coming from. If we continue down this road, it could very well end up a disaster. However, rightly or wrongly, I do have faith that Apple will do this correctly. Unfortunately, I can look at the trashy adverts in Apple News and see a world where Tim Cook can’t be so preachy any more.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I’ve been trying to formulate in my mind what I want to achieve with publishing online and my online life in general. Not to achieve like the world of content creation, worrying about metrics and income, but really what I do it for. What is the yardstick to measure things against if you aren&rsquo;t really concerned about the yards or the stick that people usually use? My publishing and my browsing habits really come down to three things — tools used, time available and the energy I have.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tools\">Tools</h2>\n<p>In my modern life, I nearly always have enough tools available all the time. I do most of my <a href=\"/2022/10/03/mobile-publishing.html\">writing on my iPhone</a>, this is in stark contrast to even a few months ago where I would always default to using my Mac. By choosing this separation, it felt a bit more organised and if I sat down to write, I wrote. Whereas now when I have an idea I capture it, or more often than not write the post there and then.</p>\n<p>This means that my fingers could nearly always be busy. There are a few moments that I don’t have my phone with me, but I can always capture ideas because there is never a time I don’t have <a href=\"/2022/10/19/falling-for-the.html\">my Apple Watch on</a>. Tools are seldom my problem now I’ve sorted out my publishing workflow.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/413cef77a6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"time\">Time</h2>\n<p>The biggest thing we all struggle with is time. Finding this in between all the things you have to do in our daily grind can be a task in itself. Thankfully, much like exercising, I can prioritise these above plenty of other things. For me, time spent scrolling social media or watch TV is better spent writing in a journal or publishing a blog post. My only comparison is against what else I could be doing because writing or reading others writing gives me lots of value.</p>\n<p>With that said, others will value things differently. Some play games to unwind, some are artists, and some love doing nothing in front of the TV. There is no right or wrong here, just the result of lots of thinking and the occasional <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMusjixdf10\">values audit</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"energy\">Energy</h2>\n<p>For me, writing doesn’t always take a lot of time, but it takes some mental energy. A certain level of motivation needs to be achieved to get an idea from a small note into a publishable article. I used to take much less care of things, but despite the scruffy appearance of my blog posts, I do send some time on them.</p>\n<p>Energy is also a big decider of where I want to put my reserves when I’ve been at work all day. Writing copy and staring at a computer all day doesn’t always mix very well with wanting to do the same thing when I come home. This is combatted somewhat by my mobile publishing workflow, but occasionally, my remaining energy is better off focused elsewhere. Playing with the kids or completing the endless lists of home jobs I have to do often gets priority here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/96cb4d2afa.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-result\">The Result</h2>\n<p>It all comes down to this. What do I want to achieve by writing the posts and publishing it? I am always conscious of not writing things to get replies and attention, and would rather get things out that help people. That might be to teach someone a new way of doing something tech related, or just show my thoughts behind topics I am thinking about.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I try to make sure that I don’t <a href=\"/2021/02/11/needing-feedback.html\">expect anything in return</a> for the posts that I write, and that I am fine with that. The result is that I want to help others, or just get the thoughts that I am typing out to a conclusion and at which point I might as well publish them anyway. My blog posts are often a public journal of sorts and cover the topics and concerns I have at the time of writing. I do often wonder why I bother publishing things, but the result is always because I like to, and that&rsquo;s enough for me.</p>\n",

I’m not a fan of this elongated squircle and have always wanted <a href=\"/2019/04/06/i-want-a.html\">something more stylish</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/10f8913784.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Thankfully, the released Apple Watch Ultra didn’t really appeal to me, apart from my desire for <a href=\"/2022/09/24/i-think-i.html\">something different on my wrist</a>. I blame Maique for this slightly because he <a href=\"https://micro.blog/maique/13513088\">highlighted the usefulness</a> of the new action button he is using for updating his <a href=\"/2022/10/17/how-i-use.html\">omg.lol Status</a>. Instead of spending £850 on a watch that would not suit my wrist just for a button, I have put some effort into making <em>my</em> Apple Watch work for me and in response, I love wearing it again.</p>\n<p>The way I have done this, and the Shortcuts I have set up, are uniquely for me and not really the point of this post. It is more to point out how versatile technology can be with a little effort. By making the Apple Watch mine, within the very tight realms of what Apple allows, makes it much more useful. An Apple Watch could never replace other devices, but I can put my phone down even more so than before.</p>\n<p>I would still like to see an action button on updated versions but for the time being I am very happy. This tiny computer on my wrist isn’t so bad after all.</p>\n",

				"title": "The iPad Kind Of Sucks Now",
				"content_html": "<p>I’ve been mulling over these thoughts for months now, but resisted on posting them because of the backlash. I know I should never do that, and feel free to post what I want, but you know what the internet is like. Following yesterday&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/10/apple-unveils-completely-redesigned-ipad-in-four-vibrant-colors/\">meagre offering</a> following 18 months of development, the time has come. The iPad sucks now, and that’s a real shame.</p>\n<p>I used to be that guy. The one that used his iPad for everything and preached about it at every available opportunity. Selling the iPad to anyone that would listen and teaching people the tricks you needed to make it really work. This was way back on an original iPad Air, then a long line of Pro variations. Then one day I just kind of ‘woke up’.</p>\n<p>I had an epiphany and realised that it wasn’t the iPad that was so great. I mean it was good, and Apple were doing what they needed to do, but it was the apps and particularly Shortcuts that made it. Apple broke several of my much-needed shortcuts to get things done, and the whole thing fell apart.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cca9f7d8c9.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html\">So I quit</a>. Publicly and emotionally, I’d had enough of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole. Fortunately, Apple now sells a perfect replacement for those that like myself spent thousands on iPad Pros with keyboards and pencils in the form of the M1 MacBooks. I chose the Max variant in an MacBook Pro, but many switched to the new Air and spent <em>less</em>.</p>\n<p>I didn’t care so much for ‘pro apps’. Or for them to allow me to use external monitors correctly. All I wanted was for them to stop messing around with the way the iPad actually worked and decide what it wanted to be. At the point of quitting, the iPad existed in somewhat of an oxymoronic state, in that it was costly but not all that capable. The software was flakey and didn’t really ever live up to the promises Apple made.</p>\n<p>The iPad still exists in that same position, but the terms are worse. My initial quitting was three years ago and nothing has changed. There has been some kind of awakening of late. One where users that previously waved their ’iPad guy’ flag have realised they are indeed doing themselves a disservice. The reality is unless you explicitly need a touchscreen, the iPad Pro is a poor, expensive, choice. Apple still has no idea what they want the iPad to be, and even less of an idea on the ‘pro’ versions.</p>\n<p>Base model iPads now come in at £500. Which is at least £100 more expensive than you should be paying for a consumption device. Sure, it can work with keyboards and pencils (kind of), but that’s not the appeal of an entry-level tablet. Couple this with a confused lineup of Airs and unimproved £1000+ pro devices, leaves next to no appeal.</p>\n<p>The answer to the age-old question of “what iPad should I buy” is now “last year&rsquo;s model”. Should anyone dare to ask what tablet they can get to do some work on might need some follow-up questions, but in reality the correct reply is “a Surface Pro”. That hurts a little.</p>\n",

				"title": "How I Use OMG.lol Statuses",
				"content_html": "<p>The fun little service <a href=\"https://home.omg.lol\">omg.lol</a> is the new hotness on micro.blog and seems to be seeping out into the wider internet. Not only is it ridiculously cheap for what you get, the developer Adam seems to be making constant updates and offering more and more value for money. For just £5 per year you get access to a landing page for your social media, mastodon instance, email forwarding and my favourite service — statuslog.</p>\n<p>Statuslog allows you to post small updates containing whatever you wish, along with an emoji. Exactly the type of thing that allows you to share what you are up to without having to interact with a service. As with everything omg.lol creates, it’s brilliantly designed and easy to customise for your use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"statusonmyblog\">Status On My Blog</h2>\n<p>I have embraced the set-up of micro.blog. It promotes using your blog for shorter posts as well as longer ones to keep hold of your content. There are just some posts that I don’t care about, and are what Twitter was really made for. Short, to the point life updates, that have no value — think “drinking coffee” and not tweet storms of information.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2024/e6a68339d4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>I put the status card right at the top of my blog home page, so should anyone land on it, they can see what I am currently up to. The level of usefulness is debatable, but I like it! For a full walk through of getting this set up see the help page <a href=\"https://home.omg.lol/info/statuslog\">here</a>, but in short I put in the following code.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script src=\"https://status.lol/[your-address].js?time&amp;link&amp;fluent&amp;pretty\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"styling\">Styling</h3>\n<p>Thankfully, the styling of the status card looks great out the box, so it’s rare you will have to do anything. I wanted it to look more like part of my blog, so I styled a few elements. This took me a bit of trial and error to get this correct. When I first implemented by own changes, I used the <code>&amp;pretty</code> on the end of the script and simply styled the areas I wanted. However, this now uses some <code>!important</code> styling and as such breaks any custom styling you want to override.</p>\n<p>To style the status card, you will need to remove <code>&amp;pretty</code> from the script above and style <em>everything</em> in CSS. The default CSS used at the time of writing is below, however this could change at any time.</p>\n<pre><code>.statuslol_container {\n<p>},</p>\n<p>.statuslol {\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-wrap: wrap;\ngap: 1em;\nbackground: #e7ebf3;\ncolor: #111;\nborder-radius: .5em;\npadding: 1em;\n}</p>\n<p>.statuslol_emoji_container {\nflex: 0 0 1em;\nfont-size: 3em;\npadding-right: 0;\n}</p>\n<p>.statuslol_content {\nflex-grow: 1;\nflex-shrink: 1;\nflex-basis: 0;\nmargin: -.5em 0 0 0;\ntext-align: left;\noverflow-wrap: break-word;\noverflow-wrap: anywhere;\ncolor: #111 !important;\n}</p>\n<p>.statuslol_time {\nopacity: .5; color: #111 !important;\n}\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>You can then go for your life, change anything and everything you want to, and make it look to your taste. I love the stock gradient of the card, but implemented my own darker version I found on <a href=\"https://uigradients.com/#Quepal\">UI Gradients</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"postingstatuses\">Posting Statuses</h2>\n<p>For a long time, I have wanted to be able to post tweets without actually opening the app. This used to be straightforward with Shortcuts (née Workflow) but the best you can do now is transfer text into the app to tweet from it. This is where the excellent statuslog service comes in. I use it to post a short update, which is posted to micro.blog, Twitter and Mastodon.</p>\n<p>If you are a Drafts user, you can use a <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2DT\">really nice action</a> to update your status easily. However, I am not, so after some inspiration from micro.blog user and omg.lol unofficial ambassador <a href=\"https://micro.blog/maique/13513088\">Maique </a> I created a Shortcut to do this. You can grab the shortcut from <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2be68317c569484781cea2ca32c8b03c\">here</a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2024/298c6757ab.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>To use this Shortcut, you will need an API key for your OMG.LOL account, that can be found <a href=\"https://home.omg.lol/account#api-key\">here</a>, and also put your account username in the other box as outlined on importing the Shortcut. As you can see, I have added this to my Home Screen for easy access and made an icon, which is below.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"uploads/2024/7bbfda8759.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>Icon available <a href=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7bbfda8759.jpg\">here</a></p>\n<p>If you then wish to then import the status into micro.blog the RSS feed you will need is <code>http://[your-address].status.lol/feed</code> replace your address with yours. If you do not use micro.blog there are automation services such as <a href=\"https://ifttt.com\">IFTTT</a> that can Tweet whenever an RSS feed is updated.</p>\n",

Despite being one of the lucky ones and not being greatly affected by it outside the obvious, I have never felt the same since. The <a href=\"/2022/07/27/210805.html\">pins and needles I feel in my brain</a> has gone into overdrive and I feel constantly burnt out.</p>\n<p>I’ve recognised this, and for quite a while I have been trying to get back to the way I was before the pandemic. Don’t get me wrong, the 18 or so months suffering its wrath did not ruin me, but I just don’t feel myself anymore. I don’t think I am alone in this, but it is more obvious because during the lockdowns I weirdly managed to shine. Dealing with a crisis suits me well, and remaining calm and collected under pressure is fairly easy. Unfortunately, the adrenaline and focus have now gone, replaced by emptiness and a sense of being lost.</p>\n<p>In the little over 9 months the UK spent really struggling to get things under control, I became the fittest and healthiest I have been for years. The fact we were all at home together meant I had time and space outside of working to really exercise. I <a href=\"/2020/05/18/getting-injured-was.html\">discovered my love of cycling</a> on empty roads, and despite my waking hours seemingly being separated by the hours I drank coffee and those I consume beer, I thrived.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a44054af3b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>My spiral down began two weeks before Christmas 2021 when I had my COVID-19 vaccine booster shot. It knocked me off my feet for weeks. So much so, my heart and lungs have never been the same since. I am still exhausted when doing small things, but I can still run a little, providing I break through an invisible barrier and manage to keep going. I have no idea what is up with me, and no doctor will listen to what I need to fix. As such my mental health has suffered dramatically, being able to exercise is one of my only enjoyments in life.</p>\n<p>I am trying really hard to get back to where I was, but being nearly 40 I feel like my body is fighting me at every step. I yearn to be back to where I was in what feels like the blink of an eye ago, but that dream always seems out of sight. No matter the effort I put in, no matter the dedication I have, I just can’t reach the proverbial carrot on a stick. In many ways, I am mourning the loss of myself, but I will not accept the me I am now. There was to be a return to normal somewhere down the line, and it best be soon.</p>\n",

There’s a lot of doom and gloom surrounding them, and more and more people wanting to ditch them (<a href=\"/2021/04/16/back-as-far.html\">myself included</a>) but you are mistaken if you think it is all bad news.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2d67eb5d85.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It’s remarkable that I am currently sat in my car waiting, <a href=\"/2022/09/16/constantly-waiting.html\">as I always do</a>, and typing out my thoughts to instantly post online. I might even spell check them first! This is my pushback against the thousands of posts I see telling anyone that will listen how bad their phone is. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been there, all the minimalism people ask you to ditch it and that used to get me down. Currently <a href=\"/2021/08/26/minimalism-and-big.html\">I choose a big phone because I can do things on it</a> that I would usually need a regular computer for. I can shape and mould this tool to enable me to do things and at the same time be aware of the downsides.</p>\n<p>Publishing is my thing, and the fact I can do it all the time in situations where I might otherwise be bored or <a href=\"/2022/08/02/writing-instead-of.html\">scrolling social media</a> should be appreciated. I can see myself doing this more and more as time goes on, and it gives a nice contrast when I sit at my computer all day doing other things.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>There’s some crazy weirdness surrounding Elon Musk. He’s the darling child of what seems like all the internet, but <a href=\"https://time.com/6171726/elon-musk-fake-followers/\">most of his followers</a> are paid for. Unfortunately for someone held in such high regard by tech bros everywhere as some kind of god, his <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23108357/redacted-version-of-exhibits-a-j-to-letter-to-the-honorable-kathaleen-st-j-mccormick-from-edward-b.pdf\">phone records have revealed</a> his ideas actually kind of suck, and he’s surround by sycophantic suck ups.</p>\n<p>I won&rsquo;t go into the ins and outs of what is contained in his texts and emails, there are more intelligent people than I to do that. What I will say is that reading some of these summarisations has made me feel much better about my business life. No longer am I held back by the ideas that some of them might suck. As <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/elon-musk-texts-twitter-trial-jack-dorsey/671619/\">Charlie Warzel</a> pointed out, “Whoever said there are no bad ideas in brainstorming never had access to Elon Musk’s phone”.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f8e238e7bf.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There truly are some absolute stinkers that come from both Elon and his long list of suck ups. Two of my favourites are Elon suggesting that people pay to tweet (at a cost of 0.1 Dodge Coin) and Jason Calacanis having “the best idea ever for monetization,”. His world-changing brain fart was charging famous people to be able to spam their followers with DMs. This is without the several conversations that exist in which they try to “solve free speech”.</p>\n<p>Never again am I going to chastise myself for having poor ideas, or even a lack of good ones. Clearly not the only reason, but a large part of people like Musk’s success comes down to finance backing and the availability of opportunity. Which is about as far away from what we are led to believe. We are told that the reason he is so successful is his ridiculously long days, or his tenacious attitude to working. Not the billions in the bank, and being surrounded by people that can provide opportunities to thrive.</p>\n<p>Both of these things are true of Musk, and he does a much better job of application than I ever could. However, peaking into his phone records gives me a behind the curtain glimpse. Allowing me to understand the real workings of those in successful positions. My ideas might sometimes suck, but they don’t suck as bad as this, and if they did, I would keep it to myself!</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>The best advice I give anyone who wants to become good at something, is to do it. <a href=\"/2020/08/17/sitting-in-the.html\">Constantly and consistently</a>, become obsessed and love the practice. This goes double for photography. Unfortunately, I think social media has ruined the expectation of taking photos and that really sucks.</p>\n<p>I was at one time worried about only taking photos that everyone likes. Studying the settings people used and trying to recreate shots that others had taken. I spent far too long picking through Instagram to find shots for places I was due to visit. Looking for the right angles and interesting things to look at. I learnt a lot, but it ruined my motivation for photography for a while because I always felt I didn’t live in an interesting enough place.</p>\n<p>Like most things, Instagram is a photography version of comparing your <a href=\"/2021/05/31/insides-vs-outsides.html\">insides to someone else’s outsides</a>. All I began to see was crystal clear, pin sharp images that had been edited perfectly, and my shots never looked like the ones I wanted to recreate. The reality is that I didn’t <a href=\"/2021/08/04/other-peoples-trash.html\">see their trash can</a>, nor the times that tried to shoot things and missed, I just saw the best of the best. My shots were never going to live up to the standard I thought I should be at and that sucked.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c31fc74f30.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Thankfully, I quickly realised that I wasn’t taking shots for other people. I was taking them for me and wanted something different from everyone else anyway. An easy way to do this was to take pictures of things, rather than capturing moments. I began to focus on things that caught my eye and rare moments that were unlikely to be seen again. Unfortunately, this can lead to instances where I only gain a handful of shots I am happy with despite hours of shooting. Or more often than I care to admit, they all went in the bin!</p>\n<p>As my interests change to street photography, the chances of poor outings increase dramatically, so my motivation can take a hit occasionally. That doesn’t mean I will stop taking them, though. That one shot I am pleased with is worth the grind of getting nothing at all.</p>\n",

Covering all of social media with its poison and then infiltrating everything that large-scale services suggest I should read. However, that issue is much larger than one topic. Matter now surfaces hardly any posts that I want to read, which means I don’t read as much.

Taking recommendations from too broad a selection of people, or making all the suggested posts human-curated. This may work for some people, but again, not I.</p>\n<p>In a world of algorithms and intelligent services, you would think that someone, somewhere would be able to learn what I enjoy reading and recommend me more like it. I would rather not live in an echo chamber, but I want to avoid having to put in as much work as I do to find enjoyable articles. This is precisely the type of useful application new technology should have instead of manipulating people on social media, can’t it just find me things to read… please.</p>\n",

Where do you start when the subject you want to talk about is so devastating, but still important to think about. I guess fair warning, this post could upset some people as it discusses children passing away.</p>\n<p>I can’t even imagine the feelings that our friends feel every year their little boy&rsquo;s birthday comes around. They have suffered the worst thing to happen to any parent and had two of their children pass away. Both suffering from a genetic heart condition that was undiscovered until their second boy died soon after birth.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9ac3024299.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>They are both amazing and a credit to their family with the way that they remember them both so publicly. Tonight we went to their home to celebrate what would have been his second birthday. Each year we remember him, as we did a few weeks ago with his brother, by releasing balloons. They each have little messages on from us all as a little token of our loss.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/508276df04.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The event is not a somber affair, but more of a celebration and a thank you for being in our lives. It’s hard to put into words how much we miss them both, and by releasing balloons it allows us to pause and think of him as they float away. A quiet and apt event which we all stand and watch with our friends. Whereas I would want to bury myself away and not be around people, they have an entirely different way of dealing with the grief and one that helps us all.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/65af8675c3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I always end up leaving their home with a renewed outlook on life. If they can deal with something so devastating, then the framing that we all put on our troubles seems insignificant. By celebrating their children each year, so publicly, they are helping others in more ways than they realise.</p>\n<p>They have set up a charity in their boys names and are also helping more families to discover this genetic condition, so they can receive the help they need.

Perhaps it is because she spent much of her life on the floor due to mobility issues, but at this point I am just speculating.</p>\n<p>If you ever visit our house, she will chase you around until she decides your shoes are not nice enough, or you take them off so she can have a proper look.</p>\n<p>It causes some weird looks from people that don&rsquo;t know her, but that&rsquo;s just Lucie — and she loves shoes.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Since moving to a <a href=\"/2021/11/05/a-new-home.html\">new domain</a> and trying to put all the things I create together online, I&rsquo;ve been feeling a bit of pressure. Granted, completely self-imposed, but a very real tinge of anxiety to be better at what I publish there. A noble pursuit but one that’s made me feel down.</p>\n<p>Before I discuss these worries, let&rsquo;s take a step back a bit and be honest. I&rsquo;m playing pretend. In a world of writers, photographers and all around publishing masters — I&rsquo;m not even small fry and the framing of this is important when discussing these types of worries. Simply because I shouldn&rsquo;t have them at all.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a0cf84bb2c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Publishing my thoughts to the internet was easy when I didn&rsquo;t care. My domain wasn&rsquo;t my name, and I wasn&rsquo;t even pretending to build some kind of online presence. I’ve been putting things online for a little short of a decade and never worried once about what it looked like. Something worth remembering because my blog in no small part is one of the reasons I have my day job. Yet now, I have some kind of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yips\">blogging yips</a> because nothing is good enough to be published.</p>\n<p>There are no shortage of ideas on what to write about, but they rarely make it past a draft. To cure it, I’ve had to <a href=\"/2022/09/16/why-gr-has.html\">strip everything back</a> and make my writing more personal. Go back to my blogging roots and make my website about me again. I may be boring, I may make ridiculous typos, but it’s the only way for me to seemingly publish more often.</p>\n<p>I am positive others feel this way because they compare themselves to others. It’s the way of the modern world online, comparing <a href=\"/2021/05/31/insides-vs-outsides.html\">your insides to everyone else’s outsides</a> and we all know it. Sometimes you have to get out your own way and just do it.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>There is no getting away from my love of photography and cameras. My favourite thing in the world is going somewhere, anywhere, and just wondering around pointing my lens at things. The simple act of doing so is like mediation to me, and nothing thing else comes close.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, I shoot loads, sometimes I don&rsquo;t. Occasionally, I get things I am happy with, more often they <a href=\"/2021/08/04/other-peoples-trash.html\">all go in the bin</a>. I love having my camera in my hand, and each year when new iPhone day comes around, I seemingly forget no phone can replace it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/58a79e02e9.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The process of taking photos has nothing to do with the camera I have. The iPhone camera that’s in my pocket is more than capable of capturing most of the street photography I do. The reason a camera matters so much to me is that it is <em>just</em> a camera. Nothing more, no internet, no restrictions. I am alone with the world.</p>\n<p>I do take loads of photos with my phone too. No doubt once I <a href=\"/2022/09/18/schrdingers-iphone.html\">get over myself,</a> I will enjoy using the iPhone 14 Pro huge new sensor. In fact, it’s the only reason I bought it. I couldn’t care less about dynamic islands and always on displays. As soon as Apple began talking about the new 48mp sensor, my brain was already thinking about what I could do with it. It’s just not a camera.</p>\n<p>Let’s take nothing away from mobile photography. In no way do you <a href=\"https://www.thedent.net/2018/10/14/224500.html\">need a camera</a> to be a photographer, people get spectacular shots using smartphones. That is simply not me. As strange as this sounds, <a href=\"/2021/07/29/having-a-camera.html\">having and using a camera</a> has become part of my identity as an individual. I carry my x100v with me anywhere, and <a href=\"https://social.lol/@gr36/108966608695072912\">despite my initial thoughts,</a> I don&rsquo;t think that will stop. I’ve never really enjoyed using a phone to take anything more than snapshots but I think now might be the time to at least try.</p>\n",

The iPhone takes up a weird position in my life where I both want it and don&rsquo;t want it at the same time. Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t open a box and remove the device from its unknown position.</p>\n<p>I first observed this <a href=\"/2020/11/21/the-iphone-line.html\">with the iPhone 12</a>, but the new iPhone 14 pro has taken this to a whole new level. The shiny new device that landed at my house on Friday is beautiful and really nice to use, but also ultimately pointless and offers me very little exchange for the outlay. This is the problem, it’s so impressive and shiny and new that I want to pick it up and use it, but also don’t want to use my phone all the time. I don’t have anything <a href=\"/2022/09/06/the-internet-is.html\"> to do on it anyway</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/800a58b184.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I am not motivated nor excited by gadgets any more. Perhaps because I am getting old, or perhaps <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/iphone-14-apple-annual-upgrade-improvements/671380/\">iPhones are getting boring now</a>. My phone is a tool, a tool I try to use as little as possible, but have accepted that it must exist in my life. The iPhone 14 pro is so good at its job that I can rely on it to do more things than ever before. I can read, and write, and take outstanding photos. I can also doom scroll social media and miss the world around me.</p>\n<p>I realise all of this is no fault of Apple or the iPhone, <a href=\"/2020/09/09/itxs-not-the.html\">it’s me</a>. I want to put these barriers in place so that I enjoy my life more, yet I miss the times that iPhone delivery day was one of the best times of the year. The new iPhone didn’t cost me much due to selling my old one, and there was only one version to choose from. Now my comparison is against the £1200 I spent buying my shiny new toy and the value it gives me back.</p>\n<p>As for right now, I’m typing this out on my iPhone 13 mini. Trying to express my feelings as if writing in a journal to myself. Can I afford the new iPhone, sure. Do I really want to spend this money, not really. This one does just fine, and probably will for a while. It’s just the desire for the shiny new things I can’t switch off. That&rsquo;s what marketing does to you, I guess.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>As with everything tech related, when I start to see similar thoughts and ideas shared online, I am never sure what the motivation is. Could it be that several people have come to a shared conclusion at the same point, or are marketing departments gearing up for something? Of course, it’s building up to that time of year when we all talk about iPads.</p><p>The simple answer when debating the authenticity of anything is to consult independent publishing, aka read personal blogs. So, when Robert Rackley posted <a href=\"https://frostedechoes.net/minimal-mac/\">Minimal Mac</a>, I knew that for one reason or another the strange feelings that I currently have around my MacBook are shared.</p><blockquote>Multitasking is bullshit. I can’t help but roll my eyes whenever someone comes with a fancy talk around the necessity of having multiple displays or app windows opened at the same time and all the time. — <a href=\"https://frostedechoes.net/minimal-mac/\">Minimal Mac</a></blockquote><p>For many weeks, I has already decided that <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2022/08/19/getting-away.html\">during my week away</a> at the beach, I wanted to avoid taking my laptop. I’d be taking loads of photos and would no doubt do some publishing, but I wanted all trace of work put away for a few days. The answer, of course, was to take my <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2022/08/18/all-work-and.html\">creative computer</a> aka my iPad Pro. I don’t <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html\">work on it</a> any more, and it has been a long time since I even used one properly, so the timing is perfect.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/07f6c1814b.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>So, I snapped on a magic keyboard, and took the most laptop like iPad away with me and used it exclusively for a week. Well, I used it a bit, this was a holiday after all. There are still some frustrations, none of which will be fixed by the upcoming iOS16 introduction of new app windowing. Infact nothing has really changed from the iPad that I left behind three years ago, but I think my expectation <em>have</em> changed.</p><p>As I type out this post back at home on my Mac, I realise how much calmer iOS is when you expect nothing of it. I wasn’t looking for a do it all machine, I was looking for it to do a few simple tasks, and do them well. There’s just something so brilliant about using one app at a time and nothing else. No more trying to fit a round peg in a square hole and expecting the iPad to be a desktop computer. Much more than this, the iPad delivered a small space of calm and straightforward usage — just like it always has.</p><p>Perhaps Apple is trying to deliver what its users want and are working hard to deliver the next generation of device. Or perhaps there is just more expectation from an iPad with an M1 chip that costs almost £1000. Whatever the reason is that the iPad Pro seems to never deliver what is expected of it, when you want calm and easy to use, iOS is where you find it.</p>\n",

				"title": "My System: Notes",
				"content_html": "<p>In my journey to <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/putting-a-system-in-place/\">improve my overall systems</a> of things and also <a href=\"https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/02/trying-to-slim.html\">slim down on some expenditure</a> has taken a lot longer than expected. There could be many reasons for this, the number of services available, my persistent love of switching, or just my lack of motivation – however I needed to get notes right first, so this is where I started.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/writing-instead-of-scrolling/\">surprising amount of my time</a> is spent writing notes. They are used to <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-i-use-2/\">manage my life</a>, keep my writing ideas and also save anything that I find interesting and don’t want to try to remember. Because of their importance, I have tried to lean on service that I think show the importance of these notes. Services like <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/roam-research-as-my-second-brain/\">Roam Research</a>, <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-keep-coming/\">Bear</a>, <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-i-use-2/\">Agenda</a>, <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-obsidian-set/\">Obsidian</a> and many more have come and gone. Costing me money and wasting time transferring things backwards and forwards.</p><p>As much as I want to be <em>that guy</em> and carry around a notebook and sketch things out. The reality is that I have to make all of these notes digital and searchable. Only one app has remained consistently used in all my time, Apple Notes. There could be many reasons it has remained despite repeated attempts to replace it. Perhaps the inbuilt nature means that it works with more things. Maybe it is simply because it is always there, but despite its shortcomings in a few areas, Apple Notes has proven the most robust and stable thing to use <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/using-ios-apple/\">for years</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/81a3cc6f6c.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Of course, this is a bit of a meme at the moment. Other people's reliance on Apple Notes proves to be constant with my experience and usage, but the internet never fails to make fun of things. I find this particularly hilarious because the journey from low IQ to high IQ is precisely what I have been feeling over the last few years. Despite using almost all the apps in this meme, I use Apple notes more than anything else, so it makes sense to just lean on this in my new system.</p><p>Don’t confuse this for a gushing review of all the things Apple Notes does better. There are flaws and plenty of them. Apple Notes doesn’t do everything I want it to. Apps like <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com\">Roam Research</a> and <a href=\"https://obsidian.md\">Obsidian</a> appeal to my brain much better than the rigid folder structure of Apple Notes. The linking between items and highlighting relationships features in all other options <em>but</em> Apple's option is more appealing. That is without the reality that Apps like Bear look and work infinitely better than my most used app.</p><p>Yet all the others fall down in others area in my systems, and the way I work means that the inbuilt abilities of Notes on my Mac and iPhone trumps nearly all.</p><h2 id=\"quick-notes\">Quick Notes</h2><p>The backbone of most of my note-taking is <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/notes/apdf028f7034/mac\">Quick Notes</a>, both the function in Apple Notes and the ability to take notes as quickly as possible. I realise that I am in a privileged position of using iPhone, Mac and iPad, but it doesn’t matter if I click in the bottom right on Mac. Or swipe in on iPad, or tap the icon in control centre — all the notes I take on the fly appear in the Quick Notes folder in Apple Notes.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/cbe100f182.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>I use this as an inbox for all the notes I take on the go. If I were to use the system outlined by Tiago Forte in <a href=\"https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com\">Building A Second Brain</a>, this would be my Capture phase. Everything and anything gets saved as a quick note to be referred to or filed later. I am not crazy on the rigid folder structure of Apple notes. My brain doesn’t work as well in this hierarchy as it would when compared to a daily note approach used in Roam or Obsidian. However, having an inbox makes it easier for me to refer to things and then schedule in times to sort through them to action, file or delete the notes created.</p><h2 id=\"siri\">Siri</h2><p>There’s a lot to be frustrated at Siri for, but it works quite well with the stock apps and means notes can be made on the go. This comes in particularly useful when driving, or out walking with AirPods in. The example below is a typical note I would make whilst walking, a book is mentioned in a podcast that sounds interesting, I make a note and act the note later when I have time.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/25e5d9ad65.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Of course, I <em>could</em> try to remember all of these notes, and some people claim that systems like these make our brains soft. However, I have been making robust notes for a little over 3 years on everything I do, work, family, entertainment and much more. This has made me able to retain more information, improve my productivity and enjoy more time switched off.</p><h2 id=\"note-taking\">Note-Taking</h2><p>It goes without saying that quick notes on the go are only one part of note-taking. There are far more notes containing large pieces of information, meeting notes and important things I need to save, potentially indefinitely. What I have come to realise when speaking to others in similar situations is that much of theirs are done on paper, if at all.</p><p>There is a certain level of expectation when watching interesting videos, reading non-fiction books, or just attending a meeting that the information you receive will just stick in your brain. This might just be me, but what I found out fairly early on at University is that taking notes and reading them back later, at least a couple of times, helps me be able to refer to them later on.</p><p>This can be by mentally recalling them fully and being able to quote some information, or simply being able to recall “I’m sure I have a note on that somewhere”. A typical one of my longer notes is shown below. Whilst listening to another podcast with Dave Brailsford, he highlighted some information about his CORE method of mentorship. I was able to make a quick note using Siri and then when I had more time I looked into it deeper and made longer notes.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/98acc9470f.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>The ability of Apple Notes to seamlessly switch between voice, written text and even handwritten notes, as with my CORE note, is outstanding and something that very few other services do as well. I am not one for dragging in images or links, but Apple Notes does this with ease too.</p><h1 id=\"file-reference\">File &amp; Reference</h1><p>What’s the point of a note if you can’t find it later on? The information in notes needs to be searchable and easy to navigate. I have not adopted any more of Tiago Forte method of note-taking with storage, but instead adopted for easy to understand folders. Some <em>are</em> projects I am working on, but most are just an area of my life.</p><p>I have to say that most notes go in the bin after a small action, or become much longer ones after researching topics. So long-term storage is only those that I really do need. I found some people online talking about almost a decade's worth of notes in Evernote, and I shudder to think of the mess, but the most important thing is being able to search and find what you are looking for.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/ee0a89c66d.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>I could go deeper and use tags and a larger volume of folders; however, I have found there is much less metal stress of deciding where the notes go if there are fewer folders to choose from. Furthermore, I will only create a new folder if there is no suitable folder already.</p><p>Deciding what notes to keep is a hard choice, but with quick notes usually being actionable, it is important to me to be ruthless and only keep information for as long as it is useful. Apple Notes Search is on device, meaning that it is always fast and easy to find what I need. The powerful indexing also searched had written text with surprising accuracy, even with my terrible hand writing!</p><p>Having toyed with Readwise and all sorts of ways to import reading notes, that just never stick an inbuilt app just makes sense. Without doubt Apple Notes is <em>the</em> app I use the most. Now I have my system in place it is working even better for me and meaning I can write more posts and know where all my stuff is.</p>\n",

He replaced Social media with ‘micro-journalling’ to improve his mental health and found some exceptional benefits, so for the last couple of days I have replaced <a href=\"https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/31/of-course-i.html\">my doom scrolling</a> with writing.</p><p>To succeed, let's face it a task like this <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/twitter-muscle-memory/\">isn’t as easy as it seems</a>, I needed to make some modifications to the way my phone works. I am not actively avoiding Social Media (AKA Quitting) I am just limiting it. So, I had to make sure I wouldn’t open up Twitter without realising it, and pack my home screen full of the types of apps I wanted to use instead.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/f05a77c833.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p><a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-reading-flow/\">Reading</a> and <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-writing-workflow/\">writing</a> in all its forms went right on my home screen to make sure they are in my face as much as possible. I am trying to make as much use of <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205773\">Apple Notes</a> as possible to capture anything and everything that comes to mind. Having already started to lean heavily on it as part of improving my <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/putting-a-system-in-place/\">overall systems,</a> the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/ipad/ipad5d91fd88/ipados\">quick note function</a> coming to iPhone with iOS16 is a particular favourite new feature.</p><p>This didn’t work straight away, I had to delete all the social apps from my phone too, and also make sure I was signed out in Safari too. Now whenever I get the itch or find myself a bit bored instead of drifting away and scrolling social media, I write or read something instead. One often leads to the other and a few minutes down the line the feelings have, thankfully, gone.</p><p>There’s a habit of these types of posts to be preachy, but there is none of that here. This is simply what I am doing to better <em>my</em> day-to-day life. Again, this isn’t about avoiding social media, it is just me trying to be happier and at the same time write more – win-win.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>It seems like an age ago I wrote about <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/love-stadia/\">loving Stadia</a>. It has its issues, is always a few days away <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/google-insists-stadia-is-not-shutting-down\">from being killed</a>, but it brought me back into gaming because of the ease of access. I had my iPad, adopted my son's Playstation controller, and I was away. Sure, I always think about building a gaming PC, but I probably never will, so enter the Steam Deck – level 2 of casual gaming.</p><p>To understand where this fits in and why the Steam Deck has made a difference to my gaming and life, the context is important. Despite playing numerous games at a young age, I stopped for so many years that I forget how many. I felt as if playing games was a waste of time, and I didn’t have many spare hours to spend gaming anyway.</p><p>Since playing on Stadia, I purchased an <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/instant-on/\">Xbox One Series X</a> and despite it being a great device, playing in-front of a TV doesn’t suit my life all the time. It scratched my itch, but I didn’t have the time between everything else I had to do, a handheld device I can pick up and put down would be a much better fit. Thankfully, Vale’s hard to get Steam Deck provided cutting-edge gaming on the go.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/782d305619.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Don’t expect this to be some kind of review, more of an overview of how much I have fallen in love with this device. Since picking on up from a friend of a friend for a reasonable price, I’ve been able to play great PC games on the go, as well as <a href=\"https://www.emudeck.com\">install emulators</a> for an all-around experience.</p><p>I don’t use my Steam Deck for even half of what it can do. I don’t hack it or tweak it or do anything that ‘real gamers’ might do. However, I do play it to death, so much so I am worried about the longevity of the battery as I have to charge it up so often. A point that is exaggerated by the fact the battery is not the best, about 2 hours of gaming is all it can handle whilst playing anything graphically intense.</p><p>It isn’t all good news. If you’re a casual gamer like me, knowing what to play is a pain. The Steam library seems to talk in some know of second language and recommend games that I have to google to find out what the gameplay is like. So, YouTube is my best friend for the games I do buy, which is far too many of them.</p><p>All these words are to say that the Steam Deck is a great device. Not the best gaming set up in the world, but just what a casual gamer needs to be able to play more and enjoy a woder selection of games.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Where to actually start? Every so often we see the once great Instagram app slide into oblivion, barely clinging on to its importance to the users that have used it for more than a decade. Unfortunately, there isn’t a service that comes close to the reach that Instagram has, but hopefully that will change if they keep going the way they are.</p><p>The latest round of excuses making is not new information, but when a <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/kim-kardashian-and-kylie-jenner-lock-horns-with-the-head-of-instagram-over-tiktok-redesign-12659928\">Kardashian chips in,</a> companies tend to answer. With that said, this isn’t because of some altruistic intentions. The Kardashians make their living from social media, and clearly the effects of Meta changing the way the app works is affecting the bottom line.</p><p>Casey Newton summed this up expertly in an edition of his <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/p/kylie-jenner-smacks-the-new-instagram\">Platformer newsletter</a> (paywall), an <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+QN1qZ9HF0/34:12\">episode of The Vergecast</a> and also a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1551685200463028224?s=20&amp;t=1DKkMp3JQfZYs7yUMS6-1Q\">widely shared Twitter thread</a>. He is dead right in conclusion — if you don’t like it, tough because Facebook has all the data, and it knows what it’s doing. Plus, it doesn’t care about you.</p><p>Adam Mosseri was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1551890839584088065?s=20&amp;t=1DKkMp3JQfZYs7yUMS6-1Q\">fairly quick to come out and answer some feedback</a> (again) following the Kardashian post. As if by magic, the same message is released, with intense stares into the camera and quick jump cuts between points. Because that’s how you do things to be down with the kids. It was long winded and clearly scripted but there are a couple of points to press on in this specific message.</p><h2 id=\"photos\">Photos</h2><p>So, where does this leave photos. As a photographer, I wholeheartedly believe that Meta does not give a damn about photos. It is a legacy which they would get rid of if they could. All the surrounding words were half-hearted and stale. Using words like “continuing to support photos” without actually showing any excitement or reassurances to those that are left out.</p><p>With this shift to mobile first video, they are also forcing photographers to either use a terrible 16:9 vertical crop that is even worse than the 4:5 one that went before it. The alternative is having your photo fade out at the bottom and look terrible. None of this was pointed out in the video, however, because Adam is <em>loves</em> photos after all.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/445f9992d4.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><h2 id=\"video-reels\">Video &amp; Reels</h2><p>The shift to videos was doubled down on. In no uncertain terms, this is <em>the</em> way Instagram is going, and its users are simply going to have to get used to it. In his words, “I do believe that more and more of Instagram is going to become video”.</p><p>The powers at Instagram see video as the future because they simply do not want you using another app, and TikTok is the single biggest threat that Meta (and others) have ever faced. As such, they will shove videos down users throats, so they realise that Instagram does video, and isn’t just a place to cross post them.</p><p>Adam pointed out that even if they don't change anything else, more and more videos are being shared and that’s what the users like. This may be the case, but you only have to look at the volume of users that <em>have to</em> post videos to get the engagement they used to. My evidence is of course anecdotal, but I have not met a simple photographer that posts a Reel apart from that they have to, or they lose work.</p><p>Not all video growth on Instagram is down to this, but a large percentage of people sharing videos are those that make money on social media and as such have no choice but to join in with Reels posting. Add into this the users who are now cross posting their TikTok videos to Instagram because why not, and you surely have a gigantic boost in video sharing with only a small algorithm change from Meta.</p><p>“If you look at what people like and consume on Instagram, that’s also shifting increasingly towards video”. These words stuck out to me the most, what Adam left out was the last part of the sentence, which should have been “because they have no choice”. Mine, as with many peoples, relationship with Instagram is tenuous at the best of times. I really hate it, but I have to post if I want more people to see my stuff. So, as <a href=\"https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/24/instagram-may-be.html\">I said before</a>, I’ll just carry on until it’s gone.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>You might have heard this term, commonly referred to as KISS, it is used in training for almost any subject you can think of. Indeed, it has become a bit of cliché but KISS relates to so many things and points in life that it should be a mantra to everyone. Keep everything in life as simple as possible, always.</p><p>Call it minimalism or whatever you want, but again it has raised importance in my life to do with photography. You may have noticed, or may not even care, that my rate of sharing photos has changed. I am sharing lots because I am taking lots, and that’s because I’m keeping it simple (and I’m stupid).</p><p>Since getting into photography 4-5 years ago, I’ve been on a mission of Gear acquisition. Buying new stuff whenever I could, and <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/having-a-camera/\">selling a few things too</a> because I thought that’s what I needed. Every time I took photos, I focused on the things I missed and not the improvements I was making. Compared my pictures to those that I admired and convinced myself that I needed a full frame camera, or some fancy glass. That I could be even better with better stuff. Despite me knowing that this has very little to do with it, whenever I looked at others I wanted their stuff and not their talent.</p><p>The thing with camera gear is there isn’t really a ceiling, so it could get idiotic. However, I was sensible, and came to a decision a few weeks ago that I didn’t want to have a ‘proper camera’ any more and I wanted to change things. Out goes full frame cameras and more lenses than I know what to do with, and in comes a Fujifilm x100v.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Can’t tell you how much I love carrying around my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FujifilmUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FujifilmUK</a> x100v. <br /><br />It’s made me capture so many things that I wouldn’t have with a ‘proper camera’ and made photography fun again. <a href=\"https://t.co/dOSLlEdSz5\">pic.twitter.com/dOSLlEdSz5</a></p>— Greg Morris (@GR36) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1531657059099361280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</figure><p>I honestly can’t tell you how much of a revaluation this has been. I watched enough reviews and videos on the camera to know that others feel this too, but I never expected it. This small camera with a fixed lens just makes me want to take photos again. There are no lenses I can lust after, no settings videos I need to brush up on, it’s almost point and shoot.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/172d2acfa7.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>I guess it could also be said that it’s making me take simple images. No more worrying about being all arty, just take photos that catch my eye. With less expectation from the photos I take, I relax a bit more and enjoy shooting. It’s so small and light I take it to more places, I feel more comfortable shooting with it, and to be honest, I just love the way it looks.</p><p>The x100v also allows me to simplify the camera itself. It spends most of the time in aperture priority and the camera does the rest. Even the JPEG’s coming out of it are great. I love this little thing because it keeps it simple.</p>\n",

Enjoyable but exhausting.</p>\n<p>You know the feeling when you get home a after a long day, you&rsquo;re delighted to be home and just want to relax for a while. Yet, the universe had other ideas for us. Lucie&rsquo;s feeding tube wouldn’t work correctly, and after some trial and error, we found out it was the button in her tummy that was broken. We couldn’t feed her.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/00655f3a3c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>So off we go to hospital. It’s 6pm at night and shouldn’t take that long for them to get us a new one and change it. It’s a 3-minute job maximum. How wrong could we be?</p>\n<p>We waited an hour just to talk to a nurse, she disappeared, never to return. Therefore, we waited another hour just to talk to another person. All the time, Lucie hasn’t had anything to eat or drink for hours and is getting increasingly frustrated—as are we. There’s more to this story that I won’t go into, but needless to say we didn’t leave the hospital for almost 4 hours.</p>\n<p>I love that we have the NHS in the UK, but it’s times like these that you really struggle to stay zen. The calmness you feel is really tested when you are dealing with organisations or individuals that seem set to try you. Almost as if the universe is playing a game with you to see if this good mood you’re in can last. You try to smile and laugh as much as you can, but the game can push you to the limit at times.</p>\n<p>Just as we are about to leave the doctor turns up, takes less than a minute to change the button and we are on our way a little before 10pm. Thank goodness.</p>\n",

They were available as a place to save Shortcut files I had written about because the iCloud link sharing can be a bit flaky. They were so old it contained loads of .wflow files and I had forgotten it even existed, but they now need to be signed to work with iOS15.</p>\n<p>Of course, I felt no need to update these, but thought it should be pretty simple, so tried to get them updated anyway. Unfortunately, I was wrong and the lack of detail in how to do this is pretty poor, but with a bit of trial and error I got them signed without issue – I hope.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tools\">Tools</h2>\n<p>You will need a Mac to do this. It is the only way I have found to reliably get everything signed using the command line. Some information online suggest that it can be done on iOS using SSH, but I couldn’t get <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/pich0y/shortcut_source_helper_helper_for_shortcut_plist/\">this to work</a>, and it felt very fiddly.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/714b9d8669.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>So to use <em>this</em> guide, you will need a Mac running macOS Monterey and be able to use the terminal app on your device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-sign-the-shortcut\">How To Sign The Shortcut</h2>\n<p>Open terminal on your Mac, and cd into the folder containing the shortcut files. Use the following command to sign the shortcut file:</p>\n<pre><code>shortcuts sign -i a.wflow -o b.wflow</code></pre>\n<p>Where <code>a.wflow</code> is the name of the shortcuts file, and <code>b.wflow</code> is the name you want the signed Shortcuts file to be called. Due to the weirdness in names, I actually found it easier to rename my source file as ‘a’ and then rename ‘b’ to whatever I wanted it to become.</p>\n<p>Who knows if Apple will change the requirement yet again, but for the time being, you will now be able to load the file into shortcuts on Mac or iOS without issue, as the new file is now signed.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Although there are a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqKkn7kpvto&t=931s\">few people</a> who sometimes use a longer lens for Street Photography, there are far more that dismiss a longer focal length. The internet is filled with posts telling you to buy a 28mm, or a 35mm or at most a 50mm lens. Sure they are all good options (who doesn’t like a nifty 50) but it doesn’t have to be that way.</p><p>The fact I don’t have to stand so close to people is the one over arching thing that makes a longer length so great. When you’re just starting out, or <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/lincoln-street-photography/\">still learning like I am</a>, a 85mm length is great. Allowing you to get the up close and personal shots that make street photography so great, but not have to deal with the people that go with it.</p>\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/2f09c7cb46.jpg\">\n<p>Some of this is confidence, I have absolutely no motivation to go up to someone and ask them if it's OK, nor would I ever point my camera at someone right in front of me and a longer focal length means I am less likely to have to. When some photographers talk about the candidness of a tiny little lens, I get the same feeling with my 85mm f/1.8 Sony lens. Taking pictures becomes easy and worry free.</p>\n<p>\nTypically, photographers think a 50mm lens would be smaller too, but not any more. If I wanted to keep a fast lens in 50mm I would be lugging around the SEL50F12GM at 778g (not to mention the £2,099 price tag), or loose around a stop of light on the SEL50F25G at a fantastic 174 g. Whereas the SEL85F18 I have strikes a great balance at 371g and a very affordable £400.</p>\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/5a338c2342.jpg\">\n<p>Using my A7c and a 85mm prime is the perfect combination of nice and light with enough ability to capture the shots I really want and be a little more removed from the subjects. This may change with confidence and progression, but let it be said that you simply do not need to buy some expensive glass nor stand really close to people to get great shots. I love 85mm for almost everything, and you might too.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>As excited as I was to unpack my new purchase as soon as it arrived, that was all dispersed the first time I used my Nordictrack SE7i Cross Trainer. The resistance felt far too high, and I puffed and panted my way through 15 minutes despite being used to doing an hour on others.</p>\n<p>I put this down to being a little unfit, or maybe I just needed to get used to this specific version. However, the shine was well and truly dulled by my first experience. Thankfully, for my sanity, I <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/nordictrack/comments/g8iuev/resistance_became_way_too_high/\">wasn’t alone</a>. Several people were having the same issue on brand-new machines, some of which returned their purchases because of this. To say the Nordictrack customer service doesn’t have a great reputation is an understatement — not to worry, here’s the fix to the resistance being too high on your equipment.</p>\n<p>After watching <a href=\"https://youtu.be/B1J_i3k55Es\">this video</a> to see how things worked, it’s easy to see there is some adjustment to the tension management cable. Numerous people have done this and made walk through video of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ2D806K1V0\">their version</a>, but thankfully my Nordictrack SE7i or S700 wasn’t nearly as complicated.</p>\n<p>You will need a screwdriver and small spanner. Remember, you do this at completely your own risk, and keep in mind this may void your warranty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-remove-the-footplate\">1 Remove the footplate</h2>\n<p>Four screws at the back of the machine will mean you can remove the foot that the machine will stand on if you fold it up.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1508c9bc61.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"2-remove-the-surround\">2 Remove the Surround</h2>\n<p>Two more screws to remove on the top above the footplate.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b90c98a6c3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>Once removed, you can remove the curved surround from the back of the machine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-find-and-adjust-the-cable\">3 Find and adjust the cable</h2>\n<p>One removed, you will be able to see inside the read of the Nordictrack Cross Trainer. Look down on the machine’s right-hand side, you will see the silver cable join that you need to adjust.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3b94a01661.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>Mine was finger tight, but you may need a small spanner to make adjust the resistance. To accomplish this, first loosen the smaller nut away from the longer piece. Then you can adjust the longer piece to your desired effect. Unscrewing makes the resistance decrease, tightening makes the resistance increase.</p>\n<p>For more information, watch the below section of video.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\">[embed]https://youtube.com/watch?v=B1J_i3k55Es&amp;start=100&amp;feature=oembed[/embed]</figure>\n<p>The advantage of not taking lots of the machine apart is you can now test and readjust as required. Mine required lots of loosening. iFit recommends a starting point in their workouts of resistance level 7, but your ability will vary.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>This started off life as a link post to an interesting video on <a href=\"https://birchtree.me\">Matt Birchlers</a> writing set up. However, it quickly spiralled out of control into me writing regular expressions, editing javascript and spending two days making this set up my own. If you’re into doing anything like this, then the best place to start is his excellent video below.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\">[embed]https://youtube.com/watch?v=GqTyyQBi3hA&amp;feature=oembed[/embed]</figure>\n<p>I’ve been <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-obsidian-set/\">using Obsidian for a while</a> and created quite a robust set-up for tasks, notes, and everything else. This lasted a while but started to fall away the longer it went on because I still had to use other apps to get things done, <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/looking-for-my/\">such as Ulysses</a>. The thing I have found about being consistent is to remove as much resistance as possible. Cutting down on the chance that the idea will slip away, or the task just won’t be completed. So transferring fascinating links in Obsidian and then then into a writing app or Ghost was untenable.</p>\n<p>So, thanks to Matt, and a few tweaks I have found something that really works and in the process I have even moved reading apps!</p>\n<h2 id=\"matter\">Matter</h2>\n<p>Despite being in the beta testers since really early on, <a href=\"https://hq.getmatter.app\">Matter</a> never really stuck with me. I was a hardcore <a href=\"https://www.getupnext.com\">Upnext</a> user and nothing could tear me away. That was until the team kept updating and improving things to a point I had to go back. Matter allows me to read all the articles I want, highlight them, make notes on them and then push them straight into Obsidian (and Notion too is thats your thing).</p>\n<p>By installing the <a href=\"https://github.com/getmatterapp/obsidian-matter\">Obsidian plugin</a>, all of my notes and highlights are pulled in and displayed for later reference. I use this to refer to things, link notes together, and research some topics that come up whilst digesting my reading list. To make this my own, I had to edit the javascript to display things exactly as I wanted. My biggest desire was for the highlighted quotes to appear as markdown quotes and a title at the top. Matt walks you though how he did his, my changes are made in the same place as follows.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\"># ${feedEntry.content.title}\n${this._renderMetadata(feedEntry)}</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"notes\">Notes</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\"></code></pre>\n<p>${annotations.map(this._renderAnnotation).join(“n”)}\n<code>.trim();\n  }\n  _renderMetadata(feedEntry) {\n    if (feedEntry.content.publication_date) {\n      const publicationDate = new Date(feedEntry.content.publication_date);\n      const publicationDateStr = publicationDate.toISOString().slice(0, 10);\n      metadata +=</code> Published Date: ${publicationDateStr}<code>;\n    }\n    if (feedEntry.content.author) {\n      metadata +=</code> Author: ${feedEntry.content.author.any_name}<code>;\n    }\n    metadata += \"n\";\n    return metadata;\n  }\n  _renderAnnotation(annotation) {\n    return</code> &gt; ${annotation.text}${annotation.note ? <code>\n  * **Note**: ${annotation.note}</code> : “n”} `.trim(); } };</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\"></code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"shortcuts\">Shortcuts</h2>\n<p>If I decide that the quote, and my thoughts are interesting enough for a link post on my blog, then the second step is to get that into Ulysses. To achieve this, I use the <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/obsidian-shortcut-launcher/\">MacStories Shortcut Launcher Obsidian Plugin</a> and link this to my Link Post Apple Shortcut.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/86dfde2825.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>With thanks to Matt once agin for s<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattbirchler/status/1493282183628402695?s=20&amp;t=ghaffL4AEjFm_JVu0DvTiw\">haring his Shortcut with me</a>, he got me quite far down the road. Due to me messing around with the way I wanted the information to be displayed in Obsidian, his regular expressions didn’t work, so I had to customise this quite a bit.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\">\n<div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\">\n<div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">Shortcuts</div>\n<div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\"> </div>\n<div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3c1d689e3c.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>This Shortcut looks for the title, URL, and Author. There’s also some customisation with the option to select the quote you wish to use and then the facility to add a different title to your post. It works on Mac and iOS; however text input is a bit finicky on macOS (as all Shortcuts seem to be). Regular expressions are the key here, so the shortcut is pretty messy and probably could be better, but the elements are as follows.</p>\n<p><code>(?&lt;=Author:)(.?)(?=n)</code> does the same but with author.</p>\n<p><code>^(#)s?(.+)n{1,2}</code> finds anything in the document that is H1, i.e. a title with a #.</p>\n<p><code>&gt;(.*?)(?=n)</code> finds all markdown quotes in the document.</p>\n<p>It is unusual for me to show more than one quote in a post as I try and pick something that sums up the whole point. Or sometimes pick up smaller sections that hit me personally but don’t necessarily reflect the whole post. If you wish to pull out all quotes then deleting the ‘select from list’ section will transfer all into Ulysses.</p>\n<p>All of this is rearranged into my set-up I publish link posts in and then opened in a new Ulysses sheet. I promise not to spam everyone with loads of link posts. In fact I don’t post many of them, but this set up has already meant that I have referred back to what I have been reading a lot more. Obviously, your millage may vary.</p>\n",

				"title": "The Ultimate Minimalist Phone",
				"content_html": "<p>For the last few years, I have been <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-cant-go/\">looking to go back</a> to simpler times. Ones that didn’t try to hack my brain every time I open my phone. Or, in fact, a time when I didn’t need to carry a phone with me at all. Those times might be long gone, but I can’t just give up on my dream without a fight. After a bit of backwards and forwards, I think I might have found the best minimalist phone.</p><p>After experimenting with <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-smaller-phone/\">older devices,</a> I felt unfulfilled and sometimes caused more hassle than they are worth. Recently, I tried a ‘dumb phone’ in the <a href=\"https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp02-4g-mobile-phone/\">Punkt MP02</a>, which left a lot to be desired considering its £300 price tag. Couple this with the realisation that I need to be able to access some apps occasionally (How on earth do you do banking nowadays when the branches are hardly open?) – I was stuck. That was until I realised I had the best minimal device to replace my phone the whole time – my Apple Watch.</p><p>I’ve been <a href=\"/2015/05/17/i-like-this.html\">in love with the Apple Watch</a>, particularly a <a href=\"/2021/10/05/a-month-without.html\">cellular version</a>, for as long as I can remember. It allows me to leave my phone at home when I don’t need it but still be contactable, yet I couldn’t see its real usefulness until I took a step back. I truly think this could be the best minimalist approach to a world that seems to demand a smartphone.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/0ad9644b2f.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><h2 id=\"minimal\">Minimal</h2><p>The screen is small and, although perfectly nice, isn’t appealing at all. Nothing about it tries to hack my brain to use it more. It just sits and does its thing without intervention until called upon. It has very few apps installed on it, most of which I can control and remove if not needed. Many services are not updating or removing their apps from the Apple Watch because they missed the point of it, but those that remain can be completely independent.</p><p>The notifications on Apple Watch are surprisingly powerful, but I did have to do a bit of work to turn many off. Apple still likes to ping you for far too many things by default – rings notifications, breathing stuff, hand-washing, and fitness all set to off. Sure you can also do this to your phone, which is recommended, but the Apple Watch just slips up a sleeve and becomes almost invisible when you don’t need it.</p><p>There's no conversation distractions, no facedown on a table dilemma, and no reason to not pay attention to the world. Much like a dumb phone, it just waits for interaction from others. Taking up very little space in the world, and much of the time you can't tell it’s there.</p><h2 id=\"useful\">Useful</h2><p>Podcasts and music work perfectly, streaming over LTE and playing through my AirPods is a dream when out and about. Not to mention, Apple Pay still stores all of my cards and allows me to pay exactly as I would with my phone. Unfortunately, the weird looks and slight embarrassment when using your watch never subsides.</p><p>As someone who has health issues currently, the Apple Watch has really shown its usefulness. Being able to pull my phone out or share data with a healthcare professional that proves my resting heart rate, activity levels and all sorts of other indicators is wonderful. Having a device strapped to my wrist that is actually more useful in many ways has proven to be great to rid myself of other devices when I don't need them.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/ba83862d88.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><h2 id=\"intentional\">Intentional</h2><p>With all this said, the thing I love most about adopting this approach is that it asked nothing in return. I can’t use it for much, but I can use it for everything useful. All whist not being a phone at all. Unfortunately, I still require a phone to set the Apple Watch up, but the bonus being that for those times I <em>do</em> need a more regular looking phone I have one. However, due to just how useful my Apple Watch has been, should it ever rid itself of the iOS reliance, I <em>may</em> consider not replacing my phone.</p><p>Perhaps my perfect combination would be an iPad Mini and an Apple Watch. I can't see a future where the smartphone won't dominate our lives, but I am some way to freeing myself. The Apple Watch gives me a semi-smart device when required, and the accompanying phone gives me a phone if I <em>really</em> need one. Which isn't frequently, it sits alone on my desk because <a href=\"/2021/10/07/i-dont-use.html\">I don't use it much</a>. Even less now.</p>\n",

Lots of <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/photography-needs-to-be-fun/\">talk about Glass</a> from people I follow has led me to think about my usage, and it’s complicated to some them all up.</p><p>The simple one is I love using it. The app design is beautiful. An uninterrupted feed of great photos with a well-thought-out UI. Finding people to follow is pretty easy now that categories feature heavily. Meaning my feed to full of both the types of images I like to look at and those of the few friends I have that use Glass.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/5a7f3dcf37.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Granted, the standard of photography feels a bit intimidating. Glass is definitely where a lot of pro level shooters share their shots. Some very skilled individuals simultaneously give me imposter syndrome and teach me lots about the pictures they take. Glass can be very inspiring in terms of the type of shots that look good and the settings to be able to capture them.</p><p>With all that said, I’m losing the motivation to check it. If it wasn’t for the wonderful widget, I think I would have deleted the app by now. Trends in photography absolutely exist, but I see lots of the same type of images. All shown in the same way, and often whole sets of images posted one after the other in a ‘dump’ that floods my timeline for a long while. However, I can put up with all this, frankly I put up with a lot bigger issues by using Instagram — but posting in multiple places is untenable.</p><p>No one I know apart from nerds on the internet uses Glass, and that is unlikely to change. I don’t need Glass as a portfolio of sorts, so I think it has reached its usefulness lifespan. The novelty has worn off for many people I follow, leading me to question my usage. As nice as the app is, and as great as the team behind it are, my interest in using something so niche is coming to an end.</p>\n",

I can’t possibly comment on the validity of these claims, but in my subjective experience it does something to me that means I can get more done.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9a47fb03a3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>For the past few months, I have dedicated my time to <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/going-deeper/\">working in a deeper state</a>, and Brain FM has proved invaluable to achieving the most I can. My favourite by far is at the top of the app home screen. Ninety minutes deep work is the peak period to get stuff done but not burn myself out. So, I sink into this state a couple of times away. Especially when I am in the office, my Bose QC35s are on, connected to my iPhone, and I am in concentration mode.</p>\n<p>The looping relaxing music soon disappears to a point where I am not listening, but the audio undoubtedly helps me shut out the world and concentrate on the task at hand. Replacing the need for me to half concentrate on a podcast or worry about what music to listen to.</p>\n<p>Brain FM is also filled full of white noise options, meditation audio and what seems like unlimited options for music. So, there’s no messing around deciding what to listen to. If you want to check out some preview of the app and see if it’s the kind of thing that will help you concentrate, there are some clips available on YouTube.</p></br>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKPZslKCeiw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",

I’ve <a href=\"https://glass.photo/gr36/4JJ4fSSeWT7TxuTnKMnvmw\">taken it before with my camera</a>, but there is something about the Christmas lights I see when walking my dog in the evening that fills me with joy. They are not over the top, not the most lavish afraid but beautiful in the dark evening.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/388f43ff7c.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Christmas always make me think about those that have gone before. Times I spent as a child growing up with all my extended family, eating and drinking until we can’t stuff anything else in. We couldn’t afford loads of presents, I wanted a Mega Drive one year, but my mum could only afford a Master system, but we always spent loads of time together. Always at my Grandmas house and always doing the same things as clockwork.</p><p>I went from a small child not really wanting to be sat at a table eating food or playing with my toys on the floor to an adult helping to lay the table and joining in the conversation. Until my Grandfather passed away, and my Grandma became too frail to host us all and the mantle passed to me for a few years. In 2021, it will be just us four now, Team Morris.</p><p>We have built our own traditions, things we do every year, and made the day ours. The reason I love the lights so much is that it tells me how far I have come, grown older, but never lost the focus on the things that really matter. Spoiling our kids with things they want, but still stuffing ourselves to completion.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Matt Birchler tweeted and wrote about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect\">Dunning-Kruger effect</a> recently. I have no idea what prompted the post, but I hope to god it wasn’t me. On looking at the graph posted I realised that I am very susceptible to this and there is a very specific point on it just for me. I am calling this the ‘Morris Point’ because it's caused me so many issues in my life, so I’m claiming it as my own.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/e6f48e2ad8.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>When you first start doing something new, or learning about a new subject, the curve at which you take in new things is steep. Leading to overconfidence and often a very high chance you will make a fool of yourself. I love these periods, where you’re obsessed with everything about the new things and learning lots, but with no experience to back up your opinions.</p><p>As time goes on, this lapses, and your tendency to have confidence in your skills starts to wane. With me, this gets to a certain point, and crashes like a stone. This is the Morris point, typically one of no return. I start to question why I am doing this, if I am good enough to carry on, and often give up completely. With little encouragement, the easy way out is to quit.</p><blockquote>Never stop doing your best just because someone doesn’t give you credit - <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CXMHhh6Irks/\">Dan Green</a></blockquote><p>The curve at the bottom looks insurmountable on the way down. The time you put in impossible to achieve, and the imposter syndrome hits hard. Only sheer determination and a bit of luck gets you through this point and on the way up again. It doesn’t matter what it is, YouTube, podcasts, newsletters. They all bit the dust because that’s the easy way out at the bottom of this curve. I am only still writing through sheer force of will, and I have nothing better to do!</p><p>A <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/do-i-like-likes/\">few likes</a>, some feedback, a positive word or two, all help when you’re at the bottom and trying to get up again. I guess you have to bear with the gobby overconfidence for a bit to see if something better comes out the other end, or if they just give up trying. Doesn’t hurt to know your limits though — and watch out for the Morris point. It’s a killer.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>After going <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-glass-half-full/\">backwards</a> and <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/refill-my-glass/\">forwards</a> (as normal) with the photo sharing service <a href=\"https://glass.photo\">Glass</a>, I am enjoying using it lots. I post the best images I take to it. Although I can’t hold a candle to some of its skilled user base, it scratches my photo social media itch and teaches me quite a bit about the images people shoot.</p><p>Right from the off, the founders spoke about their desire to avoid the expected social app norms. You won’t find follower counts, like buttons or, my favourite, an algorithmic feed. Although, it feels <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ljpuk/status/1469025288470286342?s=20\">to some</a> as if they have rolled back their choice with the <a href=\"https://glass.photo/highlights/appreciations-are-here\">implementation of an “Appreciate” button</a>. It’s not like it seems.</p><p>Extending my <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/do-i-like-likes/\">previous thoughts around social media likes</a>, particularly on images, leads to looking at how to use the function positively. I was <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/i-think-glass-should-add-likes/\">not alone</a> in thinking that Glass <em>could</em> work in a way of giving small feedback prompts but not ruin the service completely. I had some ideas, but the team at Glass have absolutely nailed it. Although at first glance it looks like a dangerous slope, no public counts and no algorithm to game means much less attention-seeking rewards.</p><p>Even the word they use, appreciate, is a perfect fit for what I want to say about a photo. Even “I like it” is not enough occasionally. One of my favourite things about micro.blog is that people would respond to posts with “thank you for sharing” which makes no judgement or response, just an appreciation of taking the time to post it. A perfect fit for Glass. I am thankful that people pay £25 a year to show me the shots they are proud of.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/d28d5f9d5e.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>As with everything, It’s not completely harmless, but I think it’s a good compromise. Take the image above. I was pleased with it and couldn’t wait to get it edited and posted. Only to receive absolutely no feedback. Is it rubbish? It is just not what people want to see? I have no idea because it just sits there on Glass for people to see. My reward is getting the shot I wanted and the process of producing the result — but not everyone is like that.</p><p>Of course, <em>I</em> don’t care. Others may do, but I feel as if the users that would care have other apps better suited to their interests. My takeaway from the update (I’ve been able to use it for a couple of weeks now) is almost all positive. Being able to leave a small token of appreciation will replace the hundreds of times I write “great shot” or “love this” and means the comments I do leave have more thought in them.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>There is no getting around the fact that creating things consistently is hard work. It doesn’t matter what it is, making videos, writing blog posts, painting, crafts, it all takes time and effort to keep going. Particularly if you need inspiration to spark the content in the first place, something that comes in waves for me. The biggest thing that help to write more, is to read more.</p><p>Full disclosure, this post was inspired by similar thoughts and guidance from Matt Birchler on his <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/how-i-read-more-write-more-and-think-more/\">content creation cycle</a>. If anyone is to be listened to, it’s Matt, cause his constant stream of videos and blog posts are unbelievable. However, I have shared some guidance on <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-reading-flow/\">my reading</a> and <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-writing-workflow/\">writing flows</a> previously to try to help.</p><p>This time I am going to concentrate on how I read things and how I then go from inspiration to publication. This will outline what apps I use, how I like to do and where I do to. Posting this hopefully will give you an insight into my creative process and perhaps help you start writing more too.</p><h2 id=\"rss-triage\">RSS &amp; Triage</h2><p>The internet is full of awesome stuff. So much so, it can be impossible to keep up with it and take nothing away but. A feeling of being overwhelmed. To combat this, you must remove any completionism you have. No one has the time to read and watch everything. So triaging the inputs you like is critical, and I do this mainly through RSS.</p><p>Using my favourite app, <a href=\"https://reederapp.com\">Reeder</a>, I have loads of feeds set up to put in content from all over the web. I can then easily look at things being published on my iPhone or my Mac and fill a few moments. I hardly ever read anything in reeder unless it is a really short post, I give scything a quick scan and do one of two things.</p><ul><li>If it looks interesting, I will share it to <a href=\"https://www.getupnext.com\">Upnext</a>.</li><li>If it doesn’t, I will move on.</li></ul><p>If I ever get to the point of feeling like there is too much to process through, I just mark all as read and move on. As compelling as things are on the web, nothing is vitally important, and good posts have a habit of popping up again anyway.</p><p>I do this a little with Apple News too, but it is filled with far too much crud to filter through very well, despite <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-to-restrict/\">limiting what is shows</a>.</p><h2 id=\"reading-highlighting\">Reading &amp; Highlighting</h2><p>I read everything in an app that I can highlight and share these with <a href=\"https://readwise.io\">Readwise</a>. This is absolute detrimental to me because I want to be able to read and retain the things that I highlight as fascinating. At the moment I am using Upnext for this, but I have also used Pocket in the past, as well and small dalliances with <a href=\"https://hq.getmatter.app\">Matter</a>.</p><p>All of my Newsletters are also delivered into Upnext, so I can highlight them as if they were web articles. Pro-tip, you can also get around some paywalled articles by saving them to relater services, but not all.</p><p>I open Upnext on my iPhone whenever I feel like it. Small instances of downtime in the day, as boredom relief, and then in larger periods at night on my iPad Mini. I don’t read every word of every article, nor do I highlight loads of things, but I adore reading and learning new things.</p><p>At any point if I highlight something really thought-provoking I will share it straight into Ulysses where I have <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-writing-kanban/\">a writing Kanban</a> set up. This is the start of all of my <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/tag/link/\">link posts</a> and many of my articles.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/f902eb95bb.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><h2 id=\"listening-thinking\">Listening &amp; Thinking</h2><p>There are four smaller areas that fall in here, all of which are important to my creative process. Upnext has the ability for me to listen to some articles, so when driving I sometimes consume these to fill the boredom.</p><p>I can’t go one without talking about podcasts, either. Although my listing has <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/podcasts-and-me/\">dropped dramatically</a> over the last couple of years, there are a few shops I never miss and listen to these at work or when walking the dog. If anything in these episodes sparks some inspiration, I have a shortcut set up to type a few words into my Ulysses inbox. I have <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/add-information-to-notion-with-shortcuts/\">also done this with Notion</a> in the past.</p><p>The third part of listening is being open and taking in feedback. There are many times I have written a post, spoken to someone about it, and then written again because my viewpoint has shifted. There is nothing wrong with this, and it is important to listen to feedback and take it in creatively. It also leads to some of the best conversations I have ever had about interesting topics. Be open.</p><p>Lastly, before anything gets published, you need to think about it. Just sit (or walk) and stew over the words you want to say and make sure they are correct. Establishing your true feelings and not rage publishing is something crucial, but it is even more critical to give yourself time to think about the things you consume. Just be alone with your thoughts and process everything.</p><h2 id=\"writing-publishing\">Writing &amp; Publishing</h2><p>Every single word I publish comes from <a href=\"https://ulysses.app\">Ulysses</a>, I am writing in it now. Having <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/looking-for-my/\">messed around with so many apps</a> and wasted a considerable amount of money, I always come back. For the small price it is an outstanding app, providing a great experience to create everything from a short link post to a full on novel.</p><p>The corrections available in the app seem to catch almost all of my spelling and grammar issues littered through every post, and it actually makes me a better writer. It doesn’t matter where you publish your work from here, but the most critical thing is that you do it. I do it mobile from my iPhone, but I do prefer to sit in the chair and type away. It gives me a better environment to think about what I am writing and establish what I am <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/something-to-say/\">trying to say</a>.</p><p>There are no rules to writing, despite some believing so, and even less to blogging so publish away. Read more, write more and let’s converse more about the things we enjoy. That tweet you just threw into the ether, <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-value-of/\">should have been a blog post</a>.</p>\n",

I dwell on things that shouldn’t take me as much time as I do, and then make others based on sheer gut instinct alone. Hell, a good 70% of this blog is me talking to myself about a decision but framing it as if I am giving advice. In most of the situations, I know what I should do, but I don’t want to.</p><p>Take my photography for example. I know that I shouldn’t <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/do-i-like-likes/\">care about likes</a>. I am also well aware that in fact I should delete <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gr36m/\">my Instagram account</a> entirely, but that is just never going to happen. I like people seeing my stuff, and my friends only seem to use apps developed by Meta. I like the little hit of dopamine that I get from a few likes every now and again. The answer to make me a better person is obvious, but sometimes despite knowing this, another option is also valid.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/68392d4c1f.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Instead, I’ll spread my photos around the internet like confetti and see what sticks. Waste my time doing all the things when I know what the ‘correct’ thing to do is — for me, at least. This expands into a lot of my life, I can never decide on <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-iphone-line/\">which phone to get</a> despite knowing which one I shouldn’t. I know I should <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/twitter-muscle-memory/\">really cut Twitter</a> out of my life, but I don’t want to. I am sure there is some psychoanalytic name for it and some deep-rooted reason for this indecision, but at this point in my life I just don’t care any longer.</p><p>There are of course some things I know I have to do for the better that overcome this barrier. Eating well, meditating and exercising to name a few, that will never fall away despite me having a million and one reason to stop. But for everything else, I will continue to give myself a hard time about it, and that’s OK. I think.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Never one to be left behind, I am continually looking for a way to speed up my theme development. Call it desire to be cutting edge, or near of missing out, whatever it is I love to play around with it. One thing that gets loads of attention is Tailwind CSS, so naturally this was on my list to play around with.</p>\n<p>They call it “A utility-first CSS framework” but what it actually means is you can style all of your classes right in the HTML. There are pros and cons with this, but here’s how to get it working on your Ghost Blog.</p>\n<h2 id=\"before-you-start\">Before You start</h2>\n<p>Fair warning this requires a bit of command line work, and if you’re not comfortable with this back away now! You will need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A computer running a desktop OS (macOS, Linux, or Windows)</li>\n<li>A supported version of <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node.js</a> (at the time of writing this is 12.x, 14.x or 16.x)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#alternatives-tab\">Yarn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm\">npm</a> installed</li>\n<li>A folder to do all your work in</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"install-ghost-locally\">Install Ghost Locally</h2>\n<p>First, start with Ghost CIL. In the command line:</p>\n<p><code>npm install ghost-cli@latest -g</code></p>\n<p>Now CD into your empty directory and run:</p>\n<p><code>ghost install local</code></p>\n<p>This will get ghost up and running locally on your machine, most errors are communicated daily well, but for extras do <code>ghost help</code>.</p>\n<p>If everything looks OK you’ll have a site at <code>http://localhost:2368/ghost</code>. For more information on what this means, check out the <a href=\"https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/\">Ghost docs</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"your-theme\">Your Theme</h2>\n<p>This next part is up to you, either install a theme you want to use Tailwind with, or start developing your own using the <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Starter\">Ghost Starter</a>. You will need to put your theme files into your Ghost local install folder, <code>content/themes</code>. If you want to clone a theme from GitHub, or your theme is stored on GitHub (<a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-to-edit-your-ghost-theme-using-github/\">you should be!</a>) CD into this folder and use:</p>\n<p><code>git clone git@github.com:&lt;your-github-username/.git name-of-theme</code></p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/948bdc03a8.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"install-dependencies\">Install Dependencies</h2>\n<p>Your theme more than likely will use Yarn, the Ghost Starter linked above is the best example. Use Arm to install everything needed by Tailwind. In your theme folder, use <code>yarn add tailwindcss</code> and then add in the necessarily files <code>npx tailwindcss init</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gitignor-file\">Gitignor File</h3>\n<p>Unless you want more than 5,00 new files committing to your repo, you’ll need a robust gitignor file. Most themes have these set up already to no commit files such as DS_Store on Mac, so make sure you add in <code>node_modules</code> to your file.</p>\n<h3 id=\"import-css\">Import CSS</h3>\n<p>In <code>/assets/css/screen.css</code> add in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This imports the tailwind classes to your main CSS. This may partly replace some of your CSS to the Tailwind classes, so something such as typography may change on your theme.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gulpfilejs\">Gulpfile.js</h3>\n<p>Add in the following to your <code>gulpfile.js</code>.</p>\n<p>1 - Under <code>// gulp plugins and utils</code> put in <code>const tailwind = require(‘tailwindcss’)</code></p>\n<p>Under <code>function css(done)</code> there will be a section for <code>postcss(</code> add in <code>tailwind(),</code> so it will look something like the following.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">function css(done) {\n pump([\n src(‘assets/css/screen.css’, {sourcemaps: true}),\n postcss([\n easyimport,\n autoprefixer(),\n cssnano(),\n tailwind(),\n ]),\n dest(‘assets/built/’, {sourcemaps: ‘.’}),\n livereload()\n ], handleError(done));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"restart-all-the-things\">Restart All The Things</h3>\n<p>Now that everything is completed, restart Ghost with <code>ghost restart</code> to make sure everything is being cached correctly. You should be good to go now and can get cracking with adding in new styling. When doing this, you will need to CD into your theme folder and run <code>yarn dev</code> to build the correct CSS.</p>\n<p>You can also try out some themes that already have Tailwind built into them such as <a href=\"https://github.com/tailwindtoolbox/Ghostwind\">Ghostwind</a> or <a href=\"https://www.origintheme.co\">Origin</a> but I am enjoying working new classes into my website. For more information on using Tailwind, see their <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs\">documentation</a>.</p>\n",

				"title": "My Focus Mode Set Up",
				"content_html": "<p>If you’re a bit sad like me, one of the most interesting features of iOS 15 is <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212608\">Focus Mode</a>. Bringing some much-needed updates to do not disturb that went before it, and also making your phone much more customisable in different situations.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is a first-gen product if ever I have seen one. Being overly confusing, and actually a bit complicated to understand. My biggest help in diving in to this was Matt Birchler’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZCx-9wF3ow\">excellent walk through video</a>. This allowed me to get mine set up in three different scenarios.</p>\n<h2 id=\"home\">Home</h2>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b559029247.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>This set up was the easiest to implement as it represents pretty much where my phone was in ‘normal’ mode. Taking the regular set-up screens and making all the apps I have installed available. What Focus mode allows me to do now is remove the use of my work email app, and also make work people not able to contact me outside work time.</p>\n<p>Now I am even less tempted to check me email, and also any rogue calls or text that creep through sometimes on days off are no loner an issue. This did take a lot of tweaking over a few days to get the contacts right, it would be great to see Apple do a bit of work on this, but it’s a good starting point.</p>\n<p>Automation features allow me to switch this on effortlessly. I am in ‘Home’ whenever I finish working hours (early morning/evening) and all weekends.</p>\n<h2 id=\"do-not-disturb\">Do Not Disturb</h2>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d810ce1322.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>The best mode! Very similar to the DND I had set up previously but even more powerful. I have all apps restricted and only a very select few people can contact me (close family).</p>\n<p>Due to being able to use different home screens at different times, I have put in a nice dark wall paper and made my screen empty using a fake black icon with <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/ios/home-screen-icon-creator-a-shortcut-to-create-custom-icons-for-apps-contacts-solid-colors-and-more/\">MacStories Icon Creator Shortcut</a>. This mode is active at night and whenever I am in meetings using Smart Activation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"work\">Work</h2>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ed89a77de4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>Any other time I am not home, I am working, so it needs it own mode. This mode removes all needless distractions and helps me <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/going-deeper/\">work deeper</a>. Bringing my task list and flagged emails in front of my face at every opportunity.</p>\n<p>I love the location automation here that turns this on whenever I arrive at my office. Unfortunately, it doesn’t turn off if I leave, meaning that I had to use the ‘Home mode” switching at times outside working hours. I feel like I could go further with this set up, but it is fitting in very well and removing quite a bit of distraction from my day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"improvements\">Improvements</h2>\n<p>My biggest take way from doing this is the surprising realisation on how unapproachable this feature is. It is both the best and worst new featured added in iOS 15. Due to this overly complicated UX, I would wager that most people won’t even try to understand it, which is a real shame. Outside this, there are a few things I would like to see.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lists\">Lists</h3>\n<p>The first being implementing lists of contacts. It gets quite messy having to add in all the people who can notify you. Adding in custom lists would help no end, or simply being able to select a few contacts that cannot contact you rather than having to add in everyone else.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d50d6992c3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h3 id=\"icons\">Icons</h3>\n<p>The icons on the Home Screen bug me more than a little, as they also display on my Apple Watch. Being able to add in restrictions to the ‘normal mode’ would help with this. There is no way to have a mode for every other situation, but also add in restrictions to apps and contacts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"syncing\">Syncing</h3>\n<p>I love the way that this feature syncs across devices, but it’s all or nothing. Adding in selective sync or perhaps even a feature to only display notification on some devices and not others would be a massive improvement. I don’t mind being tapped on my watch, or something silently appearing on my phone screen at work, but don’t want it popping up on my Mac.</p>\n<p>If this post prompts you to dive in and get something set up, then I would love you to share it with me. I think I can go further with this, but it took me so long to understand the feature and then set it up, I am reluctant to fiddle too much. Don’t let that put you off though, give it a go and see if you can improve your phone.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>When I got my first big break in my working life, it was for a giant corporation with a robust training regime. If you’ve never had the miss fortune of having to jump through these hoops, consider yourself lucky. Whilst they are mainly built sincerely, and at least instil in your staff base the same basic level of competency, they often suck.</p><p>Sales training was the worst. Someone, I presume years ago, had read far too many psychology books and put together a plan you <em>could not</em> deviate from. They handed out a massive dossier to learn that boiled down to “if the customer says X, you say Y” in as many situations they could come up with. So, I learnt it, went on my way and tried as hard as I could to regurgitate the manual as frequently as I could.</p><p>I had no choice in this, secret shoppers were another dirty trick of this company, so you felt like a robot at all times. Let me tell you, I sucked. I sold next to nothing and struggled so much I felt like quitting. Until one day I was so fed up with feeling like this I decided I was going to leave, so I talked to every customer ‘normally’ and my sales took off.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, after months of spouting the lines some of them still come out, but they felt more natural because I was taking to people as myself, not just going through the company motions. People stopped looking at me like I was trying to sell them something, and they bought something from me instead.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/2244afb207.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>I realised at that point that my problem was that I was not being true to myself. I didn’t believe in what the company was telling me to say, and that is straightforward to spot from the outside. You can’t fake it until you make it if you’re not even sure you want to — and this applies to so much else.</p><p>As I wrote about <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/something-to-say/\">a few days ago</a>, I didn’t really want to make technology videos, I went through the motions and made some because I thought that's what I was supposed to do. They sucked. I expanded from writing and talking about technology into another field that I have seen others do without actually wanting to. I went through the motions without thinking about what I was doing, as if I were following instruction on “how to build a brand”.</p><p>How many other things in life do we go through the motions without our heart being in it. The results of which will be nowhere near those that result from proper motivation. These sorts of ill-fitting ideas are preached in far too many mediums to those looking to get rich or build something. I have lost count of the times I have seen headlines similar to “Follow these easy steps, and you too can be as rich as me” or “check out the morning routine of this billionaire”.</p><p>The idea being that massive results are as easy as going through these steps. There are sometimes you have to buckle down and go through the motions, but very few where you should expect a net positive result.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>There is nothing more annoying that technology not working the way it should do, without any fix. Well, maybe there is, but this is me we’re talking about, and I’m pretty neurotic about these types of issues. I have been battling being able to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1463063190238027782?s=20\">log in to third-party Twitter clients</a> for ages and have finally stumbled on a fix.</p>\n<p>This will also address some issues with using Twitter to sign in on other services. Some users have issues not from a third party client but simply sharing to Twitter from elsewhere. The error in question has no code, no help, but lots of hassle. When trying to log in to Twitter, it displays “Nothing to see here”.</p>\n<p>Upon some <a href=\"https://twittercommunity.com/t/twitter-login-fail-shown-nothing-to-see-here/158809\">cursory Googling,</a> it seems that only iOS users suffer from these issues. Perhaps Android just handles these things better, let’s be honest, iOS can be user hostile when it comes to many web things. Solving them sometimes a puzzle in comparison to more user-friendly solves from Google.</p>\n<p>The answer thankfully seems to be simple, if impossible to find, so here you are following my guide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"option-one\">Option One</h2>\n<p>The first thing to try, and the one with the least aggravation, is to try your email instead of your username. Seems to sort out some issues, but failed to be the answer to my prayers. This is the fix that most third-party apps suggest, along with turning off two-factor authentication, signing in and then turning it back on again. Give it a go first.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c3e6f57aee.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"option-two\">Option Two</h2>\n<p>You’re going to have to purge all the Twitter web information from your device. This is the likely culprit and unfortunately, when compared to macOS or literally any other operating system, it is all or nothing. There is no option to only clear Twitter related data.</p>\n<p>Head into your setting, go to Safari, and tap on ‘Clear history and website data’. This should resolve the “Nothing To See Here” appearing after putting in your login details. Allowing you to log in to a new app or authorise a secondary service.</p>\n",

				"title": "How To Edit Your Ghost Theme Using Github",
				"content_html": "<p>Since <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/migrating-from-wordpress/\">first trying Ghost</a>, one of the best things about editing my theme is the ability to host on Github. Through a simple integration I can easily edit my theme to make changes from almost anywhere. If you want to do this too, this guide should help you out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ghost-integration\">Ghost Integration</h2>\n<p>First set up the Github integration on your Ghost install, this provides you with an API Key that you will need when using Github. Head to the settings cog at the bottom of you control panel and click on Integrations.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e0d0564529.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>Create a new integration and give it a name. On the next screen make a note of the Admin API URL and the Admin API Key. Please keep these private as these allow access to your blog content.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bc80373cc6.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"github-set-up\">Github Set Up</h2>\n<p>Secondly you will need to host all of your themes files on Github. Make a private repo, give it a name that represents your theme and head to settings &gt; secrets. Click ‘New repository secret’ and set up <code>GHOST_ADMIN_API_URL</code> and <code>GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY</code> with the integration details you set up earlier.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/87fe123509.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"796\" /></figure>\n<p>Once you have done this upload all of your theme files to the repo and commit them. The last step is to create a new file in your repo <code>.github/workflows/main.yml</code>. This file needs to contain the following.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">name: Deploy Theme\non:\n push:\n branches:\n - master\n - main\njobs:\n deploy:\n runs-on: ubuntu–18.04\n steps:\n - uses: actions/checkout@master\n - uses: TryGhost/action-deploy-theme@v1.4.1\n with:\n api-key: ${{ secrets.GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY }}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This theme will now show up in your design settings, however you will need to make a change to you theme to trigger this. Adding in some text to your readme file is the easiest way.</p>\n<p>You can now make changes to your theme through whatever way is easiest for you. I use <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com\">Visual Studio Code</a>, but on iPad I found the best app is <a href=\"https://workingcopyapp.com\">Working Copy</a>. Every time you push a change GitHub will build your site and them push these to your live site, this usually takes less than a minute.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Undoubtedly, the biggest thing I was looking forward to with the macOS Monterey update was Shortcuts. It promises to be the final piece in automating the Apple universe. Admittedly, it is a bit hit-and-miss, feeling as if it’s still in beta, but most things work well. My favourite part is pinning Shortcuts to the menu bar, and this is my favourite one.</p>\n<p>In creating this Shortcut, I took inspiration from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/linuz90/status/1458533540673564681?s=20\">Gabrizio Rinaldi’s version</a> that I found via <a href=\"https://birchbark.substack.com/p/the-truth-is-paywalled-but-this-newsletter\">The Birchtree Bark Newsletter</a>. However, I wasn’t happy with just starting the screensaver. This is fine if you are working from home, but I work in an office and regulations dictate my workstation must be locked when I am not at it. This took a bit of work as older versions made for Automator no longer work, but step forward some simple Apple script to save the day.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b44f623456.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"944\" /></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b493a5f2850541aa8ace73b1bde2d951\">Grab it</a></p>\n<p>This small shortcut will quit all apps, put the volume down to 0 (no one wants to hear your Mac pinging when you’re at home) and also lock your Mac. You can leave some apps running if you need to by customising the first step in the Shortcut. All you need to do is click on ‘choose’ and select any apps you want to keep running.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/28c29066c4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1560\" height=\"1398\" /></figure>\n<p>You will need to give Shortcuts permission to run scripts. Also make sure this is pinned to the menu bar as if you try to run it from within Shortcuts the last part will not work as the app has been killed halfway through!</p>\n<p>You are welcome to add in other automations on the end of this, like Gabrizio did, such as switching off HomeKit enabled lights or putting the heating up a bit for when you get home. I debated playing a sound clip to signal me clocking out, but I might use this a few times a day so I didn’t want to annoy myself! It would be great to see what you do, so let me know.</p>\n<p>Update: Slight tweek to make sure the whole script can run.</p>\n",

I listen to people on the internet far more than I should do. It only takes a <a href=\"https://thesweetsetup.com/josh-ginters-ulysses-setup-and-workflow/\">post like this</a> by Josh Gunter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gr36/status/1456809562561028099?s=21\">for me to clean</a> up my Ulysses set up and dive back into it again.</p><p>This could be the fourth or fifth time I have returned to using Ulysses. I’m never quite sure why I stop, I just get destructed by the new hottest thing and have my head turned. I try <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/my-obsidian-set/\">almost every new thing</a> because, as Josh says in the opening live of his Ulysses <a href=\"https://thesweetsetup.com/josh-ginters-ulysses-setup-and-workflow/\">set up post</a>, “I have these on-again, off-again relationships with certain types of apps”. Although he doesn’t with writing apps, these and task managers are my weakness — but <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/looking-for-my/\">after last time</a> I really should have learnt my lesson.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/2769ef5d64.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Enough self deprivation, let’s move on. I found the idea of a kanban set up of-sorts inside Ulysses interesting. Although my usual use of an inbox and folders for deferent types of post weren’t a million miles away, this is another step towards regular posting. For me, it’s all about getting things down on paper, at least digitally. It’s easy to forget ideas, or lose them in another notes app, but storing everything in an inbox or ideas folder should help me write more. It also won’t hurt to allow me to delete a few once the idea has settled a little!</p><p>By moving things down the question a little, I am already writing a bit more when I have a few moments, or checking over posts that I need to edit. Filling a few moments with writing or jotting down notes rather than anything else. Storing ideas and links for posts is also easy with Shortcuts integrations with Ulysses, I may share this Shortcut once I have settled on a set-up I am happy with. You never quite know with me, I might be on to the next thing pretty soon, but this setup should push me to publish more. Please <a href=\"https://thesweetsetup.com/josh-ginters-ulysses-setup-and-workflow/\">check it out for yourself</a> and see if this setup could improve your workflow to.</p>\n",

The Facebook affect has turned my once beloved app into a cesspool of attention-seeking posts that use all the UI tricks in the book to hook me in. It gets me every time. There are too many good things about it to stop using my account completely, so imagine my surprise when <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/instagram-desktop-web-post-creation-and-collabs-150032945.html\">posting from the web</a> became available.</p><p>As part of quite a few updates to the way Instagram works that are happening at the moment, Meta have launched web posting after announcing the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550010/instagram-post-from-desktop-web-browser-testing\">feature in January</a>. It’s a welcome feature to. Everyone who uses a camera knows the slight annoyance of editing your image in Lightroom after importing from an SD card. Only then having to save to Photos or send it to your phone to post to Instagram. Sure, it’s a first world problem, but it always felt like one that could be fixed. Instagram has a web interface, yet chose to close off parts of the experience to only mobile users — no doubt all in the pursuit of growth.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/e3df2518f1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>As much as I love <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/refill-my-glass/\">using Glass</a> there are far more people on Instagram and I find more posts of awesome pictures for me to look at. So sucking me straight in and wasting my time doesn’t take much doing, especially with all the wonderful autumn colours in new images being posted. Thankfully, I am awe of this and try to limit my usage or not have the app installed unless I want to post. It feels like this update is for people like me to solve the two issues pointed out above but still get usage.</p><p>It’s not perfect. There are still a few features missing from the web experience, such as editing previously posted images, but it’s a gigantic improvement. Along with recently going back to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1455947657067782148?s=21\">allowing image previews on Twitter</a> it’s great to see the service improving. If they could just get rid of the shopping tab and actually get interested in me adding photos again, that would be great!</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>As much as <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2020/10/30/of-my-favourite/\">I love 1Password</a>, I don’t love having to pay yet another subscription. So when Apple <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529266/passkeys-icloud-keychain-ios-15-passwordless-future-security-login\">overhauled their password manager</a> I was intrigued to try it out as fast as possible. Sure, using a fully integrated system probably isn’t the safest way to do things, but given 1Passwords <a href=\"https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-the-story-so-far/\">move away from OS specific apps</a> these improvements could be exactly what I needed.</p><p>At first look it works well enough to get most people going. Improving the security of average users accounts by suggesting much stronger passwords. The recent improvements also allows users to add in one time passwords, otherwise referred to as two factor authentication codes. Without doubt it is leading users down a path to making sure their accounts are much more secure and anything that allows you to do this without any technical knowledge is a good move. Even if it is perhaps not the <em><em>very</em></em> best practice to follow it is better than no password manager at all.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/6e6fba244e.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1302\" /></figure><p>With that said, entry of passwords is not always the easiest when compared to other options. Providing the website or app is developed correctly you can put in usernames, passwords and two factor codes with a few taps, but if not it is a pain to go into setting and find them. Well this <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/02578985347f49d7b4f3d95b75e0c062\">Shortcut</a> created by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Krokmou/\">Reddit user Krokmau</a> enables access on not just iOS but also macOS providing you have the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/macos/monterey/\">Monterey update</a> installed allowing access to Shortcuts. Once run it will detect what OS is being used and display the passwords stored in iCloud.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/02578985347f49d7b4f3d95b75e0c062\">Grab it HERE</a></p><p>I have pinned this to my menu bar on my mac as well as put it in the iOS widget on my homescreen so I have easier access than I have ever had before. I am sure Apple will improve things moving forward but perhaps not for another year. So in the mean time this Shortcut will save you loads of time hunting around in settings.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Without getting too much into the tools I use (yet again) I have been enjoying using <a href=\"https://notion.so/\">Notion</a> lately for all of my productivity needs. It’s not perfect but the power and flexibility it offers me for free is pretty crazy. One of the downsides is using it on the go as the iOS apps leave a little to be desired, but seeing as my usage on mobile is limited now I built a shortcut to help out.</p><h2 id=\"the-set-up\">The Set Up</h2><p>The Notion API has been around a little while but it’s very under utilised in my opinion. Given the fact Notion appeals to a wide rage of businesses and individuals alike it comes as no surprised that the API allows for quite a lot to be achieved without even opening the app. In order to get access to this you will need to visit their integrations page and set up you own access token.</p><p>1 – Whilst signed in to Notion, head to the <a href=\"https://www.notion.com/my-integrations\">main page for setting up automation</a> and add a new integration with a name of your choice. Once set up you will need the API Key, so copy this somewhere safe. This allows limitless access to your Notion data (with a few bits of extra information needed) so please keep it safe!</p><p>2 -Second you will need the ID of the database you want to add information into, you can find this in the URL when the database is open as a page. This does not work with Linked Databases so make sure you have the original one open and copy the URL.</p><pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">https://www.notion.so/{workspace_name}/{database_id}?v={view_id}\n</code></pre><p>If you have only one Workspace you wont have the Workspace name in your URL, so just copy everything after the Notion URL and before the question mark.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/a19ce8904e.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"827\" height=\"418\" /></figure><p>While you have this page open share this database with your integration by clicking <strong><strong>‘Share’</strong></strong> then <strong><strong>‘Add people, emails, groups or integrations’</strong></strong> and selecting the integration you just set up. This gives the API full access to this database only. In my example below this is my ‘Inbox’ where everything goes first for me to sort out later on at my desk.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/5ed5c14b64.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"596\" /></figure><h2 id=\"the-shortcut\">The Shortcut</h2><p>Download the Shortcut found <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a6cd20ece2324bdc9981eb266e8345d8\">here</a>. Paste in the API Key when requested and secondly add in the Database ID. You can change these afterwards by editing the commented text boxes with the relevant data.</p><p>Once run, this simple set upasks you for a title and some content for the quick database entry you are making. This then puts the information into the below JSON format using the supplied variables. The real power of using the Notion API is the possibilities are huge. The API contains the ability to set up any number of blocks inside this page, rich text styling, adding images and loads more. You can find out more information in their <a href=\"https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started\">extensive API documents</a>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-html\">{\n    \"parent\": { \"database_id\": \"{database ID￼}\" },\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"title\": {\n      \"title\": [{ \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": { \"content\": \"{page title}\" } }]\n        }\n    },\n    \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"object\": \"block\",\n      \"type\": \"paragraph\",\n      \"paragraph\": {\n        \"text\": [{ \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": { \"content\": \"{block content}\" } }]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre><p>I have set up a few of these to be able to add in items for my Todo list, blog post ideas and also clip web information for me to look at later on. I may look at creating something much bigger in future as my usage of Notion increases, it may never <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2021/05/15/my-obsidian-set/\">pull me away from Obsidian</a> fully but it’s an amazing service none the less. If you create something I would love to see where you go with the Notion API and Shortcuts.</p>\n",

				"title": "iPhone 13 Pro Review: Another Step Forward",
				"content_html": "<p>Last year I decided the iPhone 12 Pro was the best choice in the line-up. It offered the best compromise for getting the best technology in a smartphone while not having to carry around a giant surfboard. Unfortunately, it still wasn’t perfect and didn’t feature the absolute best Apple has to offer leading some (<a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/the-iphone-line/\">myself included</a>) to be a little frustrated in choosing a phone. Things are much fairer this year, but the choice is still a difficult one.</p>\n<p>Whilst last year I bought all models of phone this time around I narrowed it down to two. My choice was between <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/iphone-13-mini-review-problems-solved/\">the iPhone 13 Mini</a> for its awesome form factor or the iPhone 13 Pro. The more manageable ‘smaller’ version of Apples top of the line Pro models is better than ever in the key areas that users will care about – battery, camera, and screen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-juice\">More Juice</h2>\n<p>Many words have been written about the iPhone 12 battery life. It wasn’t that bad if you take the iPhone 11 out of the equation, but we were so spoilt by the 2019 versions that 2020 felt disappointing. Apple claimed it stayed similar, but it went from great down to just ok.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, they have returned to greatness with the iPhone 13 Pro. Being on par with the 11 Pro, and in some cases much better. I have struggled to get lower than 40% left when going from 7am to 8pm, and power users shouldn’t struggle with achieving 5hours of regular usage with plenty left in the tank. It brings back a level of confidence that you will get through the day with very few issues.</p>\n<p>The new A15 is touted as being responsible for most of these gains, with not just increased ability but also more efficiency cores. The iPhone is already overpowered for what is needed from a smartphone, but Apple still pushed forward and developed another step forward in its chips. The A15 has two performance and four efficiency cores so most of the time it will be idling along only using little power but ramp up when needed. Obviously, the iPhone 13 Pro will never miss a beat, no matter what you are doing, but neither did the two generations that went before it. The new 5 core GPU plays games and does everything you want with ease.</p>\n<p>All the tech crammed into the iPhone 13 Pro helps maximise battery life. The performance and power saving ability of the A15 help, as does the updated screen, but the fact is the phone contains a bigger battery. The trade-off being an increase in weight from 187 grams to 203 grams which <em><em>is</em></em> considerable, and noticeable as soon as you pick the phone up. Only you will know if the trade-off is worth it to you — but just know that this isn’t magic giving you extra power through the day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"super-shooter\">Super Shooter</h2>\n<p>Not all the heft can be attributed to a bigger battery thought, as the iPhone 13 Pro sports a much bigger camera housing and more protruding lenses. Thankfully, Apple are not hiding it away this year, and embracing the massive bulk because it once again provides the best camera in a smart phone.</p>\n<p>You can hem and haw about Android this and that, but the reality is every year the new iPhone comes out the others play catch up. There is a lot to be said about the image processing producing a photo you like, but without sounding too much like a fan boy, Apple have constantly taken strides (or steps) forward each year with their cameras.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/75a5ad05f2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" /></figure>\n<p>I am not sure that it is, as Apple say, the biggest camera update yet, but it is a big one. With all this said most people won’t be able to tell the difference in the images from any iPhone in the last 3 years but if you’re into the details it becomes obvious.</p>\n<p>All three lenses have been updated and are the same across the Pro line up this year. The wide camera being the most obvious upgrade, featuring sensor shift stabilisation that only featured on its big brother last year, and improving to ƒ/1.5 aperture. Combined with bigger 1.9 µm pixels the sensor captures 47% more light, meaning images are not only more detailed in darker areas but also easier and quicker to capture.</p>\n<p>The telephoto goes to ƒ/2.8 aperture, from ƒ/2.0 aperture but is 3x rather than 2x so don’t let that fool you. Allowing you to get in tighter to things that you can’t “zoom with your feet” and produces noticeably sharper images compared to previous models. I still feel a little like Apple <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/neglecting-the-telephoto/\">neglects the telephoto</a> and still leans far too much on a cropped main sensor image in lower light than it should, but the improvements are noticeable and very welcome. I like using the telephoto to get closer to images without moving so I can shoot quicker, and the standard of image produces by the new telephoto is closer to the wide camera, but still not as good.</p>\n<p>Another update is the Ultra-Wide, ridding itself of the terrible ƒ/2.4 aperture to a more usable ƒ/1.8 aperture. This is not a lens I use very often and find it a little too wide for creating anything other than arty alternative angles. However, when I do, the improvements are a huge step up. Shadows are much better and not as muddy with more detail retained. An improvement this vast might get me to use it a bit more.</p>\n<p>To be honest my photography has truly little need for an angle as wide as the 13mm equivalent, but I might use the new macro mode. Get within 10cm of a subject the camera will switch to the wide angle in macro mode, allowing you to focus on subjects down to 2cm away. I remain reserved on the novelty wearing off, but it’s certainly great to have the option, even if the interface is a little confusing.</p>\n<p>I got a little excited writing about the tech specs of the iPhone 13 Pro camera, but all of these won’t mean a thing to most users. What they will notice is the images are easier and quicker to capture than ever before giving you confidence that in almost any situation you will get the shot you want. Photographic Styles will also let you <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/28/how-to-use-iphone-13-photographic-styles/\">tune your images</a> during capture to constantly get images that you will love every time.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide\">\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-container\">\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-row\">\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/905c322266.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/b58c7dffd5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/21f081601c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-row\">\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/2d6ae09cd0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/c561006a09.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/4d9194c9f2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-row\">\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/73728af4df.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/a10f7563c0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/afb05b3456.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"refreshed-screen\">Refreshed Screen</h2>\n<p>Finally, right! Whilst Android phones have been implementing higher refresh rates for several years, Apples phones have been rumoured but never received the attention they needed. The push back was that iOS mitigated the need for a refresh above 60hz, but as soon as you use anything better you begin to understand. ProMotion is not new, being in iPad Pro for quite some time, but makes the iPhone feel much more fluid.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to tell when you first start using the device, as its more powerful too, but as soon as you go back you instantly feel it. The screen retains all of specs in iPhone screens we’ve seen for a few years, with a boost in the brightness of the screen up to 1,000nits, but the big story is ProMotion. The Apple tech used intelligently changes the screen refresh rate between 120hz down to 10hz when required. Saving your eyes, and your battery life.</p>\n<p>This is one of those features that seems like it should have been done a long time ago. However, I trust that Apple waited for the tech to catch up and the battery life to not be affected too much. ProMotion is a nice to have feature, but not a necessity unless you use it and then unfortunately it has now ruined me for other phones.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/019e5ad3df.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"goldilocks\">Goldilocks</h2>\n<p>There is simply no denying that this year if you want the best of the best the iPhone 13 Pro is the phone to go for. It offers significant upgrades over the already improved ‘regular’ line up but most of which users won’t notice. It is undeniable that the £170 extra gets you a much more capable phone that it’s hard to turn down if you know what you are looking for.</p>\n<p>The screen makes using the phone much smoother and enjoyable. The camera captures better images quicker and the battery gives you the confidence to do it all day. You will see loads of these in use over the next few months as people upgrade. Not because of these improvements but because it’s the new iPhone and that’s OK.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to be into specs to get the benefits. The iPhone 13 Pro improves the lives of average users and the experience of power users. It’s a win-win.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>When the iPhone 12 launched I couldn’t <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/the-iphone-line/\">make my mind up</a> which one of the all-new line up I wanted. Granted it was a weird year with different release dates, but in the end I ordered them all. Which was an interesting endeavour to see the real-world differences between using them. Most of which are not obvious from simply reading professional reviews. At the time I stuck on the <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/iphone-pro-thoughts/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a> which I called the Goldilocks phone, but throughout the year I switched between almost all models because I am weak.</p>\n<p>They all had advantages and disadvantages. Despite all being great phones, almost all were the same old iPhone and didn’t do anything for me. All apart from <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/iphone-12-mini-wins/\">the Mini version</a>. If you will allow me to quote myself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>when I set my hands on the iPhone 12 Mini it sparked something in me that I have not felt for a while. It was the same old iOS device I love, but it was different for a change. A truly modern smartphone in a small package with pretty much nothing taken away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of those feelings are still strong, every time you handle the mini form factor. It does take a little getting used to, even more so if you’ve used larger phones, but there is much to be said about being able to reach the whole screen with one hand. Packing a 5.4″ screen, it’s only a fraction under the ones used on Plus sized phones in days gone by — but in a tiny little package. However you’re not going to be reading any books or scrolling through stuff for hours on this phone without some eye strain.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1c98f645b8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" /></figure>\n<p>The screen retains almost all of the specs from last years model, coming in at 476 ppi and the usual expected quality from Apple displays. Thankfully, it receives a boost in max brightness to 800nits, which only becomes apparent in bright sunshine, but it’s a welcome one. The iPhone 12 line struggled in some conditions despite its 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio and True Tone technology. Thankfully no such issues plague either iPhone 13 version. You’ll also get a smaller notch in the screen too, but if you notice it you’re paying more attention than I do.</p>\n<p>Did I mention it’s small? Also light at only 140g, which rids me of the pinky pain that can strike with heavier phones. I know most phone reviews are written by individuals that have a few more years on me so are not bothered about carrying around a huge slab of glass, but for those of us more interested in having something more manageable, how great the phone is to use is already obvious from the words above.</p>\n<p>Build quality is exactly what you would expect from a top-of-the-line smartphone from Apple. I am still extremely negative towards the flat sides of the newer iPhones, but thankfully the ‘regular’ line of iPhones lacks the polished stainless-steel edges, so they are more smudge resistant. Unfortunately, the back of my Midnight version is not! The black(ish) version this year is a very dark blue that is a lot lighter than expected, with the glass back showing handling marks constantly.</p>\n<p>I usually shy away from spending too much time on the performance and ability of new iPhones. They have been faster and more powerful than users will ever need for some years now and that doesn’t change here. The A15 chip in all the new iPhones features improvements to last years A14 in both performance and battery life. I am sure you can find words about cores and GPUs in other places, but its hard to say anything about specs like this other than its great. Shrug emoji!</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-shooter\">Big Shooter</h2>\n<p>The phone itself is ever so slightly thicker than last year, but you won’t notice it using the mini. Most of the heft is in the bigger camera system. One that takes the wide-angle lens that featured only on the iPhone 12 Max last year, combines it with what is, at first glance, the same ultra-wide from last year and puts it in a new diagonal set up.</p>\n<p>The conspiracy theorist in me side eyes the slight tweak to the camera positioning as a way to signal your use of the new phone, but Apple claim they had to move it slightly to fit everything in. Which is an amazing achievement. I find it incredible that the camera lens and sensor shift stabilisation that <em><em>only</em></em> featured in the biggest phone last year makes its way to the smallest handset available. Bravo to Apple for not taking the easy way out.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/995bf38121.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" /></figure>\n<p>What this means to users is that the new Wide sensor lets in 47% more light and keeps the sensors more stable than ever. The camera on the iPhone 13 is more confident than ever, providing faster capture, longer night mode shots and a better all-round experience than anything that I have used. Sure, not since the iPhone XS have I been disappointed in an iPhone camera update, but this one lives up to the hype.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 12 cameras, particularly on the Pro, were excellent shooter, but tended to blow out highlights if you are not paying attention. When things got dark, night mode helped, but without having the steadiest hand in the world, images often left you with a water colour rather than a pin sharp shot. With the new camera system and more processing power the cameras take a big leap forward.</p>\n<p>I can confidently wave the camera at almost any scene and get a great shot. Night mode needs around a second less in my testing to achieve better results than last year and shadows retain much more detail. Most people won’t notice the image improvements, because they were great before, but everyone will notice pictures are easy to take.</p>\n<p>I would have loved this to also feature the new ƒ/1.8 aperture ultra-wide from the pro models (Apple do claim the ultra-wide lens is ‘faster’) but I can’t have everything I suppose. There’s also no macro mode from the pro models, but in my testing, this isn’t as good as it is made out to be. All in all this is a significant improvement all around. Perhaps not enough to warrant an upgrade from the iPhone 12, but one that will make even pixel peepers happy.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide\">\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-container\">\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-row\">\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/36a6d8cd5b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" /></div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/1682b69340.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" /></div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/39d160bdc9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-row\">\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/94c1ac5d00.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" /></div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/f40c307181.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/653894d73b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" /></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-row\">\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/e03355941c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" /></div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/49ca905be4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></div>\n<div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/0371985f8a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"big-cells\">Big Cells</h2>\n<p>The reality is I don’t use my phone all that much so When Apple introduced a mini version of an up-to-date smartphone it instantly grabbed my attention. The perfect handset for me. Well Almost. The iPhone 12 Mini lacked in battery life so badly that in the times I was away from home (few in 2020) it was always a concern — so I disappointingly went back to a regular 12 and sulked.</p>\n<p>In fact, it was the biggest compliant I saw from other users, or potential buyers. The battery life was average, as long as you didn’t expect to use it like a big phone. This year, the Mini sports what Apple claim is 1.5 extra hours of battery life – which is only a useful stat if you have something to compare that too.</p>\n<p>Apple figures are almost impossible to follow along with, and they use all sorts of figures to avoid telling you what to expect. In my testing the battery life is around 20% better than last year’s model. The iPhone 13 Mini lasts around as long as the iPhone 11, which is as Apple claim 17 hours of video playback.</p>\n<p>In the real world I can easily use my phone for 3–4 hours (I did it for science) and still have around 40% left. However, I don’t have notifications on for anything other than phone calls, messages, and emails, and don’t use many apps outside of banking, Twitter, Instagram etc. The iPhone 13 Mini still won’t stand up to someone using their phone lots (or so-called power users) but this phone is not the appeal for those people.</p>\n<p>I don’t have some anti-phone stance, but when I spend my days talking to my family, sat in a meeting with an iPad and Pencil or sat in front of an iMac the Mini is perfect. It fills the gaps I need it to but perhaps it won’t fill yours. It isn’t for everyone.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/30a6395493.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"585\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"less-is-more\">Less Is More</h2>\n<p>It’s not all good news though, because the small form factor has some downsides. Modern life seems to point most users towards a larger and larger device, so using a ‘smaller’ phone is not conductive to all tasks. I have small hands, to typing on the mini is great for me but everyone else I have shown it to struggles.</p>\n<p>There is a cultural expectation to be small phone adverse which becomes apparent when people ask about your phone. Others use words like “too small for me” or “its tiny” when in fact it isn’t small at all. Many of them are already using phones that are marginally bigger, if at all, but the Mini feels much more compact than it is.</p>\n<p>There is not much that can be said about the iPhone 13 Mini that isn’t summed up in a few words. It’s ultimately an iPhone so you know what you are getting, a top-of-the-line phone in a small package. The iPhone 13 Mini is an upgrade as if Apple went through the phone and ironed out the few, but large, issues from the iPhone 12 Mini. Meaning that it has stepped up in my estimations from a good phone to a great phone.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 13 Mini is bigger than ever. Bigger camera, bigger battery and sporting a much bigger appeal. I can recommend this phone to other people now, and I think the iPhone 13 Mini will be the phone most people <em><em>should</em></em> buy, but they won’t.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>This is so pro, and we think you’re really going to love it. Words that seem to flow out of every Apples executive at every mention of their top-of-the-line iPhone. Of course, we can argue for ever about what <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/what-is-an-iphone-pro/\">Pro actually means</a> but when it comes to cameras, Apple talks a good talk in every press release. You can’t argue with the fact they walk far down the line of supporting those statements too, but for whatever reason just don’t seem want to give their users pro camera controls.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, you can achieve amazing things with the iPhone camera. In my opinion it is still the best smartphone camera to just point and shoot <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/samsung-galaxy-note/\">the Note 20 Ultra</a> gets remarkably close.) and 90% of the iPhone users won’t care about this at all. They will carry on shooting shots on their iPhones and getting amazing results. However, for the few of us out there that want more control we are reliant on third party apps like <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide-mark-ii-pro-camera/id885697368\">Halide</a>, or just admit defeat.</p><p>Most of the controls needed are available in a sense. Users can tap on the screen to adjust the general exposure of an image and use a slider for a bit control over the image. Focus can be changed slightly and even locked with another tap(s) on the screen although and minute control is not allowed, and the camera interface also lacks any kind of influence over shutter speed. Something that becomes immediately obvious once you want to use Night Mode, but the option appears and disappears what seems to be randomly.</p><h2 id=\"f-stopped\">F-Stopped</h2><p>All in all this is fine. As said most users won’t even need these kinds of options, and that’s why they are missing. However, it can get frustrating when Apple makes a big deal about what aperture their lens are and grade the amount of fake background blur achievable in Portrait Mode in f/stops yet give you absolutely no control over this in camera, it’s all fixed. I love the fact that the new iPhone 13 Pro’d wide camera can go down as low as f/1.5 but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to shoot at f/8 sometimes!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/ad1828a947.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Perhaps I am missing something. It is possible that Apple have thrown so much stuff into its very confused camera interface that I have missed out on learning new tricks. Indeed, I didn’t realise I could lock focus until I wanted an Instagram reel a few days ago. With that said, even because the expose control exists doesn’t mean it is easy to use, or that I know what is changing in camera. Shutter speed or ISO, both of which I want to be able to control myself. Undeniably Pro photographers take <a href=\"https://austinmann.com/trek/iphone-13-pro-camera-review-tanzania\">amazing shots with them</a> all the time, but for an Oh So Pro Camera, it’s not as pro friendly as it should be.</p><p>The solution if you really want pro controls, and I think any solution Apple would point too, is third party apps. I use Lightroom, with a quick launch option as a widget, but many others rely on the awesome app <a href=\"https://lux.camera\">Halide</a>. The argument could be made that the team behind Halide are doing a ‘better job’ than Apple in pushing the iPhone (and iPad) camera boundaries and <a href=\"https://lux.camera/iphone-13-pro-camera-preview-the-hardware-changes/\">informing its users</a> that want more out of their photos. Granted, again this is going to be a ridiculously small percentage of their users. Leaning on a third-party system is fine for a more robust reminders system, or a new email app but falls down a little for such an integrated part of your smartphone such as taking pictures. At least until Apple allow me to set a default camera app and support it properly.</p><p>Instead, the solution is that the time has come for Apple to really put its money where its mouth. To deliver a pro interface to go with its pro camera set up. Most third-party apps do a wonderful job at imitating the stock camera app and making it feel more ingrained with the system, but if Samsung can build nice pro controls into its app, so can Apple. Oh, and add on a <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/the-iphone-needs/\">camera button</a> while you’re at it.</p><p>Edited at 16:19: I had not realised the aperture was fixed on Apple lenses, which makes sense.</p>\n",

Being able to add in a high resolution backing to all your apps overtime you unlock your phone or tablet that shows of your personality sometimes takes a lot of thinking about. However, the new update to <a href=\"https://thewallpaperapp.com\">The Wallpaper App</a> is the only tool you’ll ever need.</p>\n<p>Version two from indie dev Ben Harroway, speaker at WWDC 2019 and the brains behind <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/noisy-book/id1474786858\">Noisy Book App</a> takes the already great app to a new level. I expected nothing less because when Ben produces apps he delivers in spades, with the second version packed full of customisable stunning wallpapers for iOS.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3773\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bb48c81e18.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"267\" /></p>\n<p>One the day when some will be receiving their brand new iPhone 13, you can transform your current phone with a few taps. With a simple interface of taps and swipes you can scroll through the huge inventory of designs in-which you wont struggle to find something that takes your fancy. But don’t think this is just a glorified gallery. The Wallpaper App also allows you to customise all the designs to your liking. With almost infinite combination of design tweaks available along with the ability to personalised colours.</p>\n<p>So it doesn’t matter if you’re addicted to dark mode, need something bright and beautiful to cheer you up or are looking for a cool live wallpaper to show off to your friends, the version 2 update to the Wallpaper App has it all. I’ve Downloaded loads of them already for both my phone and iPad and you’d be hard push to no fill up a large part of your storage with gorgeous wallpapers – for £1.99 it’s an absolute bargain. #Notsponsored</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "Incremental Updates",
				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Every time Apple update something in their line-up that doesn’t quite live up to people’s expectations the finger pointing starts. Words like “incremental”, and the lack of “innovation” start being banded around along with the “should have been an S year statements”. I don’t agree with these statements in relation to the iPhone 13, however even if that is the case for you, these small steady steps forward are the best thing for everyone.</p>\n<p>I struggle with the urge to upgrade more than most people. I obsessively get a new iPhone each year (yes even the iPhone XS) and more than occasionally <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2020/11/21/the-iphone-line/\">look back and regret it</a>. Each year the new phones indeed offer me something, however small, but I have come to terms with the fact that the drive for me to upgrade is one of habit and ego. When it comes to the device <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2021/08/26/minimalism-and-big-phones/\">I use the most</a> I just like something new, constantly. The sheer fact that I buy the pro phone each year is because it is new but being mindful of this allows me to see just how truly stupid it is.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3768 size-large\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/97c1b8a097.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" /></p>\n<p>This so called “lack of innovation” or “incremental updates” are exactly what our consumerist culture needs. Small updates each year help to dispel the myth of needing to constantly upgrade. Indeed, the actual benefits of newer models are becoming so small that when talking to others it is easier to put people off than ever. Leaving room for you to question the line up and be far more objective about <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2019/03/20/over-stretching-to-upgrade/\">stretching to upgrade</a>. A positive further enforced by a line-up that contains overlapping features and, at least perceivably, very few compromises at each price point.</p>\n<p>Sure, there are more capitalist ideas behind releases than I want to think about. There must be technical reasons but simple things such as moving camera lenses to new positions could be interpreted as making sure to show off the new phone. You can be sure each year there is also a new flagship colour too. However, a line up where you can get 90% of a phone at 70% of the cost is one that I applaud. Long may small incremental updates keep coming and someday even I might not feel the urge to buy, but I doubt it.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It is with great sadness that I announce the death of a good friend of yours. The Greg Thinks Thing newsletter sadly passed away in its sleep because of neglect. It has a good run, reaching the ripe on age of fifty-two editions, and leaves behind much of its content in the form of blog posts ‘retconned’ into my blog as if it has always been there.</p>\n<p>But seriously it’s gone. I tried my best to keep it going but since <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2021/07/27/be-happy-it/\">no more working from home</a> and more blogging going on, I just don’t have the time to write it. Many of the resent things I tried to write specifically for the newsletter felt forced, or rehashes of blog posts so I will leave this excellent platform to those more suiting of sending things straight to your email inbox.</p>\n<p>It served a great purpose though. I sailed along at the boom time when everyone and their pet hamster had a newsletter and wrote more during what was a tough time for me and my family due to COVID and national lockdown(s). It gave me something extremely specific to aim for and make sure that despite everything going on around me I published something very personal and got a lot of things off my chest. Sending them to people that <em>really</em> wanted to read them.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3694 size-large\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6a46ab2762.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" /></p>\n<p>Which brings me to a larger point about the purposes of the things that I do. Newsletters started off very personal things, sent straight to us directly without messing about online. Like a direct message from a friend filled with thoughts and ideas. However, this has changed, newsletters are now a massive industry with top notch writing that is only available through email. Often linked to more controversial publishing Substack has also managed to gather up some writers that want to stand on their own and publish exclusive things only to the people that want to read them. Hiding everything away unless you pay for it.</p>\n<p>Whereas I want the opposite. I have fallen back in love with writing again and long may it continue to bring my joy. I want people to get my thoughts however they want. Social Media, RSS, reading apps and there are even service out there like Mailbrew that will package it back up to an email if that’s your preferred method. Reading and writing is the most important thing for me, and the small thoughts that maintained more than fifty editions of my newsletter will just be blog posts now.</p>\n<p>Thank you to those that read the editions. Or didn’t, you just signed up and that was enough. I enjoyed writing them immensely but it’s time to focus on different things and let those that can write better than I take you money and ping your inbox.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<p>How do you write a follow up post? Especially one where you’ve <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/my-glass-half-full/\">changed your mind</a> just because someone on the internet said you should have stuck it out? Or do you avoid writing it at all and just hide away in blissful ignorance. Those are questions for other days, but today I <em>will</em> write it because I <em>did</em> change my mind and return to using <a href=\"https://glass.photo\">Glass</a> and I am glad I did.</p><p>I did the same thing with Hey — the now divisive email app — and flip flopped around before diving in for a year. <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2021/08/16/glass-thoughts/\">Glass</a> is different though, I don’t really know what to do with it but I can’t leave it because it just looks so good. I missed looking at the awesome photographs in one of the best designed apps I have used for a long time. It was simply the lack of being able to find such an enjoyable experience anywhere else that lead me to begrudgingly stump up the £25 entrance fee <a href=\"https://glass.photo/gr36/1E9mo3orrGY0IsUmVfENpU\">and post a photo</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/bb6111f61b.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>I don’t want to write about Instagram again, because all those words have been said. Yet the lack of every other existing service is the very reason I was pushed again to Glass. As much as the lack of interaction on my photos was annoying, and the same appearance of the photos I saw is still true using a different service with different aims takes a change in mindset.</p><p>I don’t want Glass to be another social media service where I follow everyone that I know (obviously I will do) I want it to be something different. I just want to look at nice photos that people are proud off and at the moment Glass is chocked full of them.</p><p>As everyone posts their best photos from their highlights and no doubt catches up with all the great photos, they have taken over the years I am impressed by the standard of shots. In fact, I am almost embarrassed to post some of mine, because they don’t feel up to the excellent standard of those I am scrolling past.</p><p>I have deleted so many photos that I thought were great at the time, and fine on Instagram – but now I am playing photographer I am not so sure!</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Try as I might to be a good minimalist, I get <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2019/12/16/losing-minimal/\">lost along the way</a> every now and again. I am never sure if I am doing this right, not spending too much time on taking instruction or being aware of how others deal with things. Yet there is one thing that I see constantly around those that title themselves minimalists and that is their aversion to technology and particularly phones with big screens.</p>\n<p>I don’t use minimalism as a destination. I am not as crazed as some people that visit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/\">the sub Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/pbet1x/the_tshirt_debacle/\">constantly worry</a> about ridding themselves of more stuff, I just like having less things. What I do have, and what I do, gets some thought put into it and I only purchase what I really need in my life.</p>\n<p>When it comes to tech, I love new things. I can’t help it, it’s my one weakness, and at this point I have given up fighting it. I spend quite a lot of my life online for my job and enjoy using my phone more than most minimalists would let themselves and I am perfectly happy with that. To me, my life is about making informed choices, being aware when those are being <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory/\">taken away from me</a> and being willing to take a step back when needed. Which brings me to my feelings towards using big phones.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3565 size-large\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2749254c38.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>Hey look, you do you, but I used to give myself a tough time whenever I used one (that doesn’t sound like me at all does it). Sure, a smaller phone in general <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2017/07/16/a-smaller-phone/\">makes me much happier</a>, but when you put thought into a purchase and having something bigger adds value to you, these feelings shouldn’t exist.</p>\n<p>I constantly think about the people that worry themselves silly because they feel that minimalism means they must have less and less at the detriment of themselves. These is no end point, or goal to achieve, simply some rough things for you to think about whenever you think about bringing new things into your life. Being mindful of the things that you do, and the things that you buy to ensure you get the most amount of value possible. If a bigger screen on a phone does that for you, or I, then that’s great.</p>\n<p>I have flaws in the way I approach tech <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2020/11/21/the-iphone-line/\">in lots of ways</a>. I am mindful of the way it can manipulate me, but also open to new way of looking at things. I like having a bigger phone because it is one of the devices, I use the most. I communicate on it for my job, my personal life and I write much of my blog on it. Couple this with the fact my eyesight isn’t what it was, and a bigger phone just gives me more value and I am sure it would do for others too.</p>\n<p>I wrote many of these thoughts as a process for myself to understand why I am thinking about getting a max when then new iPhones come around but feel free to use these as your own excuse to not feel bad.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"title": "How To Publish To Micro.blog With iOS Shortcuts",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>My blog is currently hosted on the excellent micro.blog service. I could go on about why I chose this place to host, but my thoughts are summed up on <a href=\"/2021/03/28/why-microblog.html\">my post here</a>. It suits me perfectly because I publish everything to one place, from short ‘tweets’ to photos and also all of my writing. Due to this ease of posting I do most of it mobile from iOS with the help of some Shortcuts.</p>\n<h2>Images</h2>\n<p>Pictures are pretty easy to handle on micro.blog. If you want to post one image with some accompanying text there are a <a href=\"https://micro.blog/about\">range of apps</a> to use, including the very Instragram-esc <a href=\"https://sunlit.io\">Sunlit</a>. Meaning you can post whatever you want wherever you want.</p>\n<p>If you are writing a longer post and want to put some accompanying images in it, this simple Shortcut has you covered. It will upload the image to your micro.blog uploads section and then copy the link to the image directly to your clipboard ready to paste into your writing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2024/1c9552c63a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"152\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/01d2ded5a96f4dc28bbb9961642fc08b\">Get It Here</a></p>\n<p>All you will need to do is attain a app token by going to Account settings and scrolling to the bottom and clicking App Tokens or clicking <a href=\"https://micro.blog/account/apps\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Text</h2>\n<p>No good posting something without any text. For Shorter ‘tweets’ a range of apps are available to making posting easier, however if you really want to speed things up this simple Shortcut for iOS will ask for your post and then…post it.</p>\n<p>For longer posts with a title this simple shortcut will help you out. Simply highlight the text you want to post and share it it the Shortcut, it presumes you are writing in markdown and will remove Title formatting for you and use this as the post Title.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2024/735cb9231a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1230\" height=\"566\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/772cc414fc5d453594d87706f3bbc465\">Get It Here</a></p>\n<p>All you will need to do is attain a app token by going to Account settings and scrolling to the bottom and clicking App Tokens or clicking <a href=\"https://micro.blog/account/apps\">here</a>. This posting really is one touch. There is no facility to add in categories (I may work on this later) but I use filters very heavily so these are well worth <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2019/11/06/microblog-filters-with.html\">looking into</a>.</p>\n<p>Note: These currently do not work on iOS15!</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "Publishing To WordPress With iOS Shortcuts",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>If I can be allowed to stick my neck out a little here, I think the iPad is the perfect blogging device. The battery life is great, it’s very affordable, you can take it anywhere and interact with it in several different ways. In a pinch you can even take photos with it, although you might get some strange looks. Publishing from iOS has also never been easier, and here’s how to do it with a couple of Shortcuts.</p>\n<h2>Images</h2>\n<p>Often choosing images is the hardest part of a blog post, once you’ve chosen them you have to upload them and choose where you want the go. Which can be a real pain particularly on a mobile device. WordPress is pretty easy to work with but means you have to stop what you’re doing and use either the web or their app to sort out images. This is usually where people give up, but fear not, the Shortcut below will upload your image and copy the markdown syntax for it directly to your clipboard.</p>\n<p>This Shortcut was created by <a href=\"https://initialcharge.net/projects/toolkit/\">Mike Rockwell at Initial Charge.</a> who has a whole toolkit of Shortcuts for publishers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2024/211e433487.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"666\" height=\"307\" /></p>\n<p>Get it <a href=\"https://github.com/gr36/Shortcuts/blob/276ec6a1d0773fabb11f8f8bdd85ab5b634db1ef/Upload%20Image.wflow\">here</a></p>\n<p>No more messing around, simply select your image, use the shortcut and paste in where you want the image to appear in your writing. You’ll need to set up a <a href=\"https://tinypng.com/developers\">Tiny PNG account</a> with this one so you don;t take up too much space with your images and pages load faster, but its really easy to do. In fact because this Shortcut is so simple I sometimes now upload the images I want to use and paste them in first.</p>\n<h2>Publishing To WordPress</h2>\n<p>Once all the words are finished, the final step is to publish your posts. This usually involves copying the text, opening the web browser, logging in and going through the various steps of actually getting everything out there. This can be streamlined down to a few taps using the Shortcut below. It is one I have <a href=\"/2021/01/28/shortcut-publishing-to.html\">shared this one before</a>, which was first created by Tim Nahumck in his <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-4-siri-shortcuts-wordpress-and-more/\">drafts review</a> I simply updated it to use newer Shortcuts methods.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2024/ce3789c3fe.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"666\" height=\"307\" /></p>\n<p>Get it <a href=\"https://github.com/gr36/Shortcuts/blob/276ec6a1d0773fabb11f8f8bdd85ab5b634db1ef/Publish%20to%20WordPress.wflow\">here</a></p>\n<p>This Shortcut will transfer all the text into a new blog post for you, as well as set the title correctly, remove any extra spacing and then ask you to confirm categories and tags. Meaning you don’t have to rely on using a app with publishing built in, you can now write your post out in any app you like such as Apple Notes.</p>\n<p>There you have it, you can publish to WordPress with a few taps thanks to Shortcuts on iOS.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "Early Xbox Gamepass Thoughts",
				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The future is finally here. No you still can’t work on an iPad, but game streaming is finally good and starting to remove the need for hardware. You should already know going into this that I am already well on the boat with cloud services like this, and a heavy <a href=\"/2021/02/13/stadia.html\">Stadia user</a>. It was the service that got me <a href=\"/2021/03/04/playing-again.html\">playing games again</a>, and although I feel no affiliation to the service, I like it very much.</p>\n<p>This morning for some strange reason I noticed that I can sign up for Gamepass ultimate now for a £1! Whilst still in beta, the service allows for anyone to sign up following a pretty lengthy closed beta period. I don’t own any gaming hardware at all, so cloud services are all I am really interested in currently. Despite my love of Stadia I have alway had half an eye on Gamepass Ultimate. It contains a few games that I would want to play, and seems like it <em>should</em> put Googles dalliance with cloud gaming into the shade.</p>\n<p>The two services have lots of crossover parts, whilst adopting two pretty different approaches to gaming. Stadia wants to be your everything, provide you with free games for a small fee and allow you to buy others from them. Whilst Microsoft simply wants you to pay a subscription and be allowed to play games from studios it owns or works very closely with. There is no facility to buy games outside of these provided with your subscription.</p>\n<p>With Stadia, games do rotate in and out of ‘pro’ (which costs £8.99) but once you have claimed the games you can continue to play them — as long as you keep paying the subscription of course. With Gamepass you’ll never own anything, presumably games will stay on the service and more will be added, but if you stop paying, no more gaming. Where as Google will allow you to keep playing any games you have purchased without paying a penny, all be it at 1080p and not 4K like with the pro service.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/fa1d87b3c6.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>With all this said, Gamepass is actually amazing value for money, and even more so if you own an Xbox or a gaming PC. Included is Xbox Live Gold and EA Play in the £10.99 a month subscription. If you have hardware you will also get more games — for example you can play FIFA 21 on Xbox or PC, but not cloud streaming for some strange reason. However the quality of game available for free is much larger on Gamepass.</p>\n<p>Ultimatly it all boils down to Microsofts ability to do what Google wanted to do. It has the power to make games available because it has been doing this longer, and owns its own studios. Google have <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286252/google-stadia-studios-shut-down-timing-good-progress-report\">shuttered all of its first party studios</a> despite spending millions on them, and instead are to focus on partnering with others the develop or port over games, with varying success.</p>\n<p>Although Gamepass is the much better value for money, I am reluctant to jump in without being able to buy other games. this may lead to me having both services until that happens, or as MS no doubt will hope, I buy an Xbox. I see Gamepass as a huge edition if you have an Xbox or a gaming PC, and will only get stronger over time. However for someone like me I could run out of games I actually want to play fast and then have no where to go. </p>\n<p>I expect Gamepass to very quickly outshine Stadia and hopefully push it to get much better. Or kill it off completely.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"title": "A Question Of Platforms",
				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When publishing a link post yesterday about blogging feeling more away from regular social media, the main point picked up on was comments on my posts. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/curtismchale/status/1409638107331194881?s=20\">Curtis Hale points out</a> there is no provision for people to leave comments on my posts, other than replies on micro.blog.</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"/2021/03/28/why-microblog.html\">chose micro.blog recently</a> due to its social side and also the nature of the platform allowing me to post everything in one place. I didn’t spend any time wondering <a href=\"/2021/02/13/165913.html\">where does this go</a>, and put short ‘tweets’, Instagram style photos and long blog posts all on one blog. Making the experience a bit more personal.</p>\n<p>In exchange for this I get a much more rigid platform than the WordPress one I came from, and rely totally on one persons vision for what he wants. Manson does an excellent job of running micro.blog but that’s not really the point, that is to say that I have given over a large portion of control to another person. Much like Facebook and Twitter dictate what I can and can’t post, micro.blog controls the way the platform works and how it moves forwards.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/691af88fb3.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>When thinking about comments the only thing that works are micro.blog replies. I should <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2021/05/19/webmention-and-twitter.html\">be able to pull in replies from Twitter</a> using bridg.y now, but it has never worked. I no doubt <em>could</em> look at other options and try and run a stand alone commenting system, but this would be hacked on rather than an integrated solution. Giving over this large level of control sometimes feels freeing at times, but in equal measures frustrating.</p>\n<p>If the platform decides to go a direction that you don’t want to then you are at its mercy, or you pack up and leave. Something that <a href=\"/2020/03/03/being-able-to.html\">should be easy to do</a>, but often at times isn’t. Perhaps something more open is better suited to what I want to achieve, or where I want my blog to go.</p>\n<p>I am lucky in the fact that I can usually mold things to get to where I want to be and if I think about comments and the potential of avoiding the trappings of social media, my current platform does not provide it. I guess its important to think about these things when you give over control, and rember that needs can change a lot faster than platforms do.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The past weekend we managed to grab some time away as a family. It’s been a long time coming as we booked this in March 2020, so the release to finally get away was huge. The break away wasn’t anything lavish, but even a couple of days with zero to worry about and we can enjoy some activities together was fantastic. For the long weekend I chose to not take any connective technology with me, and it can’t tell you how both weird and wonderful it felt.</p>\n<p>The day we arrived whilst waiting to order some food, twice in fairly quick succession I raised my wrist to see what the time was. Only to see a faint tan line and in indent from my Apple Watch. I let out a small groan due to lacking the ability to check the time, and wondered why on earth all of my tech was at home a couple of hours drive away. I didn’t need it, I didn’t want it, yet my brain still tried to play through the tried and tested route of fixing a small period of boredom with a gadget.</p>\n<p>As much as I am aware that <a href=\"/2020/09/09/its-not-the.html\">it is not the internet that does these things to me</a>, it is becoming harder and harder to mediate them with the reliance I have of both working online and enjoying spending time connected. I am currently managing to live in an in between space where I try and limit the time I spend with gadgets, but not miss out on what they can do for me.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b8ffc36d39.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"406\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2>Pandemic Issues</h2>\n<p>There were a few issues. When we left each other for even a small period of time, such as walking to the shop to fetch some breakfast, my wife couldn’t update me on what she needed. Of course this wasn’t a huge deal, but I also couldn’t use the NHS COVID app to track me being at several facilities, and as such felt a bit out of place. I could have done this manually, but I am not comfortable leaving my personal details on a random forms, so opted to just rely on my wife scanning the QR code.</p>\n<p>All of the attractions we visited also required ordering of food and drink from a smartphone app which again I had to lean on my wife more than usual. The pandemic has placed a reliance on our connected lives and the smartness of our devices far outside the ability to contact with others. I am under <a href=\"/2020/08/09/i-cant-go.html\">no illusions that me being without a smartphone</a> for a longer length of time just wouldn’t work out, but it’s nice to dream a little.</p>\n<p>The lack of Apple Pay, messaging and everything else my phone does for me didn’t crop up  as much as I thought it would. Most obstacles could be overcome with a little thought, but having a computer in your packet is just so much easier. However the silence from my need to check social media and the reduced pocket space needed made for a much more enjoyable break away. What first was an annoyance of not being able to find out the time became something I enjoyed and instead focused on other things.</p>\n<p>I have not decided when I will return yet as I am enjoying a break away for the next week. I did open Twitter today to be greeted with 13 notifications. All of which are spam to try and get me engaged in the platform again. So I swiftly closed it again. I miss it, but not in the ways I expected. It’s great to log off for a bit every now and again.</p>\n<p>I might realise how much I miss it…. Perhaps.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"title": "Using Craft For Daily Notes",
				"content_html": "<p>One of the most beneficial habits I have gotten into is taking daily notes, and I really wish I had started it earlier in life. My initial foray into Roam Research gave me the inspiration to start recording my day, simply because it is right in your face whenever you open the page. This practice has gone with me to my new home on <a href=\"http://www.gr36.com/2021/05/15/my-obsidian-set.html\">Obsidian</a>, then a few weeks ago <a href=\"https://www.craft.do\">Craft</a> launched something so <a href=\"/2021/06/03/i-love-the.html\">of course I checked it out</a>.</p>\n<p>Craft is a strange app that I cant really work out. When it first launched it was pitched in a strange place that didn’t quite do 100% of anything I needed. It wasn’t quite a writing app that did everything a paid app should, but had a weird wiki kind of vibe to it. I can only describe it as if Notion and <a href=\"/2017/01/19/bear-the-serious.html\">Bear Notes</a> had a baby.</p>\n<p>Having tried, and not liked very much, Craft a couple of times already, it was only the update to include daily notes that peeked my interest. While I am no stranger to jumping around apps, I wasn’t quite ready to start messing around with my set up again. However there is no harm in trying things out without getting invested and this update is a huge one.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cb564a1b6e.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>By introducing a redesigned sidebar, Craft have allowed you to separate these notes away from everything else you want to write. <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-obsidian-set/\">Daily notes</a> is a practice that I preach to almost anyone that will listen, the one thing that remains from <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-to-start/\">my time using Roam Research</a>. In these I record almost everything that happens during my working day, such as telephone calls, things I am thinking, interactions I have had and anything else I think I might need to refer back to later. This allows me to just get things out of my brain at the time they pop up so I can act on them later, or refer back to them if needed.</p>\n<p>One thing that Craft now does really well is the ability to take meeting notes. After you have granted the app permission it will display any calendar events and allow you to start a meeting note with one click. Information from the calendar event is populated into this, and the note then shows up in the daily note and also the in app calendar. I like to distribute the notes I have made later to those that have attended, or invited so being able to do this in PDF, docx or whatever method you need is really handy. If you adopt Craft for work, you can also share these with the users you need to and even mention them in the doc itself.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5fbb18b607.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"craft-back-links\">Craft Back Links</h2>\n<p>Craft works with the now very popular method of back-linking meaning you can link notes together if needed and refer to them at later points. This is the real benefit of me being able to refer back to things I have recorded later on. This could be some bits of information that led to a meeting, or something as simple as an idea that I later turn into a blog post. In the screen shot above, I make a note at the end of the meeting to reference a new one set up (we usually agree on this and arrange the event in the meeting) so this then shows up when I start in the new meeting note. I can then open the note in split screen or a new tab and refer back really easily.</p>\n<p>Backlinks are also really handy when building out some knowledge and making notes around topics. Amazingly handy if you are studying something, but also useful for daily life. I get ideas quite often that pop up during my morning pages that i write out when first at my desk. I can then start to link recurring topics together really easily by using <code>[[]]</code>and searching for the old note. This isn’t <em>as</em> useful as the implementation in Roam or Obsidian, but its not far away and is a little more approachable.</p>\n<p>One update I would really love to see is the inclusion of unlinked references, and also improvements to the ability to search for individual block references inline. I don’t like taking my hands away from the keyboard when typing things out on morning pages, so this would be much better. However I realise that this isn’t Obsidian to I am happy to take some compromises.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/da87d3f630.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"actions\">Actions</h2>\n<p>More often referred to as tasks, Craft has inbuilt checklists for you to be able to add in meeting actions in markdown or using its <code>/</code> command. Although Craft is no replacement for a task manager, you can use this as a sudo one for recording things to do. Each day will highlight any outstanding tasks next to the date. You can of course put these actions into your task manager of choice, Craft works really well with Things 3 providing a link back to the note in the tasks set up.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ea50cfc764.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>With all that said, if you intend to use the tasks inside Craft please note that there is no easy way to see all set up items in one place. The only place these are highlighted is in the daily notes. I have reached out to the developers and they <a href=\"https://twitter.com/craftdocsapp/status/1403255301067919360?s=20\">are intending to implement this soon</a>.</p>\n<p>There you have it, a very brief dalliance with daily notes in Craft. It isn’t as fleshed out as I would like but it’s pretty robust if you are going in with no expectations. I am sticking to Obsidian for the time being, but will have half an eye on any updates coming out.</p>\n",

Jack Batty <a href=\"https://copingmechanism.com/2021/trying-to-live-on-the-ipad-for-a-while/\">wrote about</a> wanting to try and make the iPad his everything, and this part particularly stuck out.</p><blockquote>But, iOS is calmer than macOS, and right now I need a little calm. – <a href=\"https://copingmechanism.com/2021/trying-to-live-on-the-ipad-for-a-while/\">Jack Baty</a></blockquote><p>To use the word that tech commentators hate to hear — when I am ‘working’ on an iPad (e.g. writing a blog post or editing a photo), it <em>feels</em> different. As Jack puts it, using iPad OS is calmer, it never feels like work. Granted sometimes it’s a full time job trying to work out how you do somethings that are simple on a Mac but <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-simplicity-of/\">the simplicity</a> is so refreshing. The iPad feels <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/this-feels-more/\">computer<em>ish</em></a> without feeling like the rest of my waking life.</p><p>So, here’s the ‘forcing’ part. I am going all in again. Apart from my work day, which I can do nothing about, I am using an iPad for everything else. I haven’t spent anything, it’s a 2018 12.9″ iPad Pro with a Magic Keyboard I have had for a long time so I have nothing much to lose. I am actually quite excited.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>At Apples WWDC 2021, Apple focused very tightly on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/\">improving the security</a> of their products. Many people dismiss this as a “marketing line” and although there are some worrying trends in the way they are going about things, this is the Apple way I approve of. One of the <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/09/newsletter-publishers-concerned-apples-mail-privacy-protection-will-crater-industry\">biggest push backs</a> has been against their improvements to Apple Mail that removes tracking and spying tactics used by marketers.</p>\n<p>Dubbed Mail Privacy Protection, it nullifies the tiny little trackers in emails you receive, ones that relay loads of your private information to servers without your knowledge.</p>\n<p>Presumably Apple will route emails through a proxy and load tracking pixels on their servers before serving the email to you and I am really struggling to find a downside to this. There will be loads of people waiting to tell me how wrong I am, just as they did <a href=\"/2021/03/10/stop-tracking-random.html\">last time I pointed at them</a>. I am happy to be proven otherwise, but most of they people that speak up are ingrained in a business that needs this data, but my conclusion is drawn from three areas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your newsletter is free, you don’t (or you shouldn’t) care if people read it or not, because the work involved in producing it is exactly the same. </li>\n<li>If your newsletter is paid, you are paid by the people that sign up to receive it. Thus it makes no difference if people actually read it or not. The cost of production is the same, and you get paid the same regardless. </li>\n<li>If you send marking emails, you will need to see if your emails are successful or not. This is the only area where tracking would matter to you, and to this is say tough. Full disclosure I am involved in this area of business and I am <em>still</em> happy Apple are turning off the tap to those more predatory than myself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/774f0c2865.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>You see, there is nothing inherently wrong with tracking if an email is opened or not, it can be useful to know. We have it in message services such as iMessage, and you have been able to do this <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-and-request-read-receipts-and-delivery-notifications-a34bf70a-4c2c-4461-b2a1-12e4a7a92141\">optionally in Exchange</a> email for years. However these are transparent and something the end user has to agree to. Presumably using the method detailed above, all tracking pixels would be marked as opened anyway, and then it is up to the user to read it or not. However most tracking doesn’t stop at this.</p>\n<p>Take a look at most marketers email dashboard and you will be able to see not just when it was opened and what links are clicked on but also how many times and where the person is! Data that should be protected unless a user opts in to share this with you. <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/help/use-track-mailchimp/\">Pixel tracking</a> is one of the many scourges of the internet and I trust Apple to lead the fight against it.</p>\n<p>We <a href=\"https://www.litmus.com/blog/apple-mail-privacy-protection-for-marketers/\">cant say for sure</a> if the open rate metric will no longer be valid, but with certainty everything else will be killed off and I for one am overjoyed!</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

I am really excited to be building up a larger team around me to push the company forward, but my trusty iMac Pro has been donated to a returning member of staff more in need.</p>\n<p>Due to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1405492177254371329?s=20\">my indecision</a> in knowing what to do I am not left with only one computer. I know ultimate first world problem right! My working machine is my personal laptop, one that is with me almost always. I do love my 13″ MacBook Pro though, I purchased it a few months before they switched to M1 and it looks awesome working on a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1403245747684921346?s=20\">nice big display</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyway I digress slightly. The point I am trying to make is that due to this shift, my computer is now everything. Personal things and working things are all done on the same laptop. So where I could separate my life slightly from my laptop to my iMac, that’s no longer possible. I never set up emails on my personal machines before and installed very few working apps. That is no longer possible, my home and office have merged, everywhere I turn working is always in my face.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/024bb57546.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>For most of the time this is fine. I love the work I do, and I often have ideas for design bits or some inspiration at the weekends. Being able to jump straight into Illustrator or Figma is a blessing for those sorts of situations. For every other time when I just want to open up my laptop and do some personal tasks, my emails and other work things are just right there staring at me!</p>\n<p>If I thought I had lots of <a href=\"/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html\">Twitter muscle memory</a>, I have even more for work tasks. I just find myself replying to emails on a Sunday afternoon, or managing tasks for the upcoming week without even realising it. Much like my working office being the same as where I do my personal things, it gets to the stage where there is no separation and I never feel like I am away. Some personal rules or spaces need setting up I think. Perhaps two users for my laptop. Or maybe I just need to <a href=\"/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html\">get an iPad</a>!</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I seem to be writing about the <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2021/06/12/will-the-ipad.html\">iPad a bit more</a>, simply because people are thinking and talking about it more following WWDC2021. You can guarantee this always happens at two points, following release of new hardware, and after software updates. Amplify this double of Apple have released a new iPad and then talked about a software update that hasn’t met imaginary predictions. So, currently we are in the middle of a perfect storm, or I guess an imperfect one.</p>\n<p>The common consensus seems to be that the iPad needs to move forward and be more like the Mac. There is some long held belief that the iPad Pro must start to deliver everything to everyone, becoming more like a traditional commuter — when in fact the opposite is true.</p>\n<p>I love having a iPad because it can do everything I need. If I want to chill out on the sofa and read a bit, or I want to scribble some notes in a meeting it is perfect. I also know that of I need to draw out some design concepts, illustrate a document or connect a keyboard to write out a blog post it can do all that and more — with ease, and most of all simplicity.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/67fb302c3b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>I can get in depth and have side by side windows, Slideover ones and picture in picture stuff going on, but I can also open an app in full screen by default and everything else gets out my way. No docks to hide, no menu bars or anything else to worry about — a procrastinators dream.</p>\n<p>Some of these feelings come from working on a Mac all day. The iPad feels different and more relaxed, but even when I used an iPad as my main computer I just loved the way it was simple to understand and got where I needed it to go. I wasn’t trying to force a square peg in a round hole, I wasn’t expecting it to do anything more that I needed it to, because when push comes to shove, better tools are available.</p>\n<p>I must applaud Apple for achieving this mix of power and simplicity for iPad OS. Every time “someone familiar with the matter” starts to talk about making the iPad like a desktop computer I feel a little bit of dread that the iPad will loose its charm. Push too far towards the work, and loose its way with everything else it is great at. I wish Apple would bring the iPad out into the sun with feature parody, but it doesn’t need anything else to be a great iPad. For everything else, there’s a Mac for that.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

I love the iPad, I <a href=\"/2017/02/19/one-year-of.html\">used it as my only device</a> for years, and <a href=\"/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html\">now I use a Mac</a> because it fits my work life better. It is because I love it so much that I appreciate everything it can do for users.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/2021/04/26/where-does-apple.html\">As many others did</a>, I sat and watched WWDC2021 and expected the iPad to go up a gear. It did in many ways, but the updates still left many wanting more. I don’t believe users should be up in arms at the exclusion of “pro apps” and screaming for the myriad of features that were never promised by Apple — but with that said the iPad still feels a little stagnant.</p>\n<p>Apple can’t or won’t make the iPad too powerful because they want you to buy a Mac too. For proof of this look no further than the upcoming <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/11/how-universal-control-on-ipados-15-and-macos-12-works\">Universal control</a>. A feature which feels like an extension of Sidecar, allowing you to move your mouse across the many screens you have at your disposal. Be those Macs or iPads. Yet even <em>this</em> feature isn’t universal at all.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2024/0c3e382683.jpg\" alt=\"e9e34e7ce2.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>You can only use this control <em>from</em> a Mac. So if you were thinking you could use your iPad and move your mouse across to grab a file from a Mac, you have another think coming. Unfortunately Apple still view your iPad as Mac adjacent. A supplementary device that is amazingly powerful but just not <em>quite</em> there.</p>\n<p>I worked from an iPad for around 7 years, since before the iPad Pro was even a thing. So I know what an iPad is capable of and I know where it’s limits are. You will get no wild claims from me about where you can and can’t work. Yet the iPad still seems to exist in the shade of the Mac. Not quite achieving its potential.</p>\n<p>Seemingly for the fear of cannibalising Apples computer market. The taste left in many users mouths is one that all the moves Apple make are to entice customers to purchase more devices. Hey, they’re a company, that’s the way companies grow. But after years of users waiting and wishing for things I am starting to get the feeling that the prayers will always go unanswered.</p>\n<p>Undeniably the iPad makes strives forward each year – some small, some large. Yet the potential is never met, and perhaps never will be. I dream of a world where the iPad steps into the sun and becomes its own thing, because it’s only Apple holding it back now.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

It was the first social network that clicked for me, despite having a Facebook account for a while before hand. The fast moving pace of updates and the activity levels of people that I enjoyed following just made it a place I wanted to be.</p>\n<p>When I first started using Twitter I was hacking the iPhone and had a pretty successful side hustle unlocking them and helping others develop Cydia hacks. I was also really deep into Android Twitter building loads of friends that I still speak to all over the globe. I had a place, a constantly changing environment surrounded by people I wanted to deal with. I got hate from Apple fanboys but I didn’t care. This was me and I loved it.</p>\n<p>The user base then felt like it was tiny. People that I spoke to in real life didn’t really use Twitter that much, but fast forward to now and it feels like everyone is here. It’s still fast moving, but it’s huge and often times exhausting. So <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2018/01/20/using-microblog-aka/\">I’ve tried to quit</a>, more than <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2021/01/11/social-media-in/\">once</a>. Yet I keep coming back once I feel better, and then it got too much again, and the world goes around because I never learn.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2024/538e51a027.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Trying to work out what is so exhausting is the puzzling part. Partly it is the speed of information flowing past, <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2021/04/11/time-to-slow/\">slowing down</a> always proves effective. However I have never really ever managed to put my finger on why, until today.</p>\n<p>Listening to an episode of ‘You’re wrong about’ <a href=\"https://gabz.me/2021/06/08/youre-wrong-about.html\">recommended by Gabz</a> the concept of “What about…” was given as becoming exhausting and it instantly clicked of me. I love hearing other peoples opinions on things, expressing myself and giving far too many of my own outlooks in replies to tweets — and this is part of the issue. Opinions are something everyone has, and should be happy to share them with others, but when there is <em>so much</em> noise it gets frustrating.</p>\n<p>As the host points out, When you tweet your three favorite bagels, someone will come back “but what about Poppy seed..”. The solution is not to <a href=\"https://guce.techcrunch.com/copyConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_110e3c71-85c4-4d53-9464-8afa519254d0&amp;lang=en-US\">stop people from replying to tweets</a>, or limiting them in anyway, because that’s just not Twitter. To be honest I don’t think there is a solution, apart from not using Twitter so much.</p>\n<p>I am certainly going to be more aware of the replies I make to others, and simply enjoy the sharing of opinions.Maybe write a blog post or two instead. Replying only when I have something to add, or a question is asked. This isn’t going to stop me going down rabbit holes and wasting time, but it should help my mental health a bit.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I am making my way through the wonderful book “Think Like a Monk” by <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/0008386595\">Jay Shetty</a>. It’s hard going, because there is so much to think about I have to stop and digest much of what is being introduced. One of the largest ideas I have found beneficial is the idea of a ‘Values Audit’. A dedicated time where you asses where your perceived values fit into your life, and make some conclusions towards your actual values.</p>\n<p>For example someone may claim their values are spending time with their family, but can’t put their phone down to interact with their children. Or you claim there is no time to exercise, but spend hours a day watching TV. This can lead you to be self critical, but there is no need, really what comes from this is more shaping of your actions to display what you value the most.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cb5c249012.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>As my granddad would always say to me “talk is cheap, actions pay the bills”. It’s free and easy to outline the inner working of yourself in words, but your actions quite often display other things. A recent book I read on called <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781090532084\">Ruined by Design</a> by Mike Monterio discussed a similar thing when designers do things they don’t want to do, but fail to stand up for their values. Leading to a large portion of companies implementing manipulative practices, but this doesn’t just apply to designers.</p>\n<p>How many of us would take a position or a job that doesn’t fit in to our values. To use myself as an example, would I design for a company that portrayed dark patterns? Would I write for a company that tracked its users and showed loads of adds? Would you?</p>\n<p>Of course many of us would. Taking a job simply because it is with a company we want to work for, but doesn’t display any of our values. There is a certain amount of fighting from the inside you can always do working for a company that doesn’t stand <em>for</em> you, and there is no shame or accusation in that. However it’s important to be aware of whats happening and do these value audits regularly.</p>\n<p>Being mindful about the practices you have, your outlook on the world around you and most of all, your output into the world. If at all times we can ensure our true inner values are being portrayed and supported, the world would be a much happier place and you will be a much happier person in it.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"title": "My Obsidian Set Up",
				"content_html": "<p>For the last few months I have been using Roam Research as the powerhouse behind almost everything I do. I’ve written previously of my love for the way it allows me to record my thoughts and everything that goes on in my life. It links very heavily in to both my <a href=\"/2020/08/21/my-writing-workflow.html\">writing workflow</a> and my <a href=\"/2020/08/22/my-reading-flow.html\">reading workflow</a>, and as such has been a huge boost to my working and personal life.</p>\n<p>Even with all this praise, I have still always looked for something else. Although it has proved valuable, I don’t love the £195 a year price tag, and I also hate it is only semi available on mobile, and has no offline mode. I’ve tried alternatives, including <a href=\"https://obsidian.md\">Obsidian</a>, but nothing else quite fit the bill, but this time something stuck and I’d like to share my current Obsidian set up, what it does for me and how it could help you.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b06f3598b8.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-it\">What Is It</h2>\n<p>Obsidian is, in there own words, a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. It takes many of the things I loved about Roam (I have no idea which one came first), particularly the network of thoughts that link themselves together but makes it local.</p>\n<p>This is a huge benefit when you consider that access to something as important as your network of thoughts should be available at all times. I have not experienced issues accessing Roam, but other online apps <em>have</em> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/evnryg/notion_is_not_loading_site_and_desktop_app/\">had these issues</a>. Also consider that I <em>have</em>lost work because Roam has updated itself and not saved my document — and I am <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/gdbq77/how_common_is_data_loss/\">not alone</a> with these issues, as rare as they are.</p>\n<p>Instead Obsidian builds on top of plain text markdown notes that are stored locally. Granted, this means that you rely on things syncing between devices, so if an internet connection <em>is</em> in short supply you will still have issues. However is means you can create and edit files wherever you are and don’t rely on the cloud. I have my ‘vault’ (more on that later) set up in iCloud that syncs to all of my devices quickly and easily. The text files are kb in size so I have, as yet, not had a single issue.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-set-up\">My Set Up</h2>\n<p>As with most platforms promising to boost your networked thought, Obsidian can be as simple or as powerful as you want to be. At its base, you simply point it at a folder, called a vault, containing text files and Obsidian displays them for you. You can put these files into folders of unlimited depth and set them up however you wish. By clicking on a file you display the text within it.</p>\n<p>You can link these files together, by using the now very familiar double square bracket ([[]]) or the hashtag #. This allows you to link notes together in non hierarchical order. As in, they can link backwards and forwards as well as to whatever else you wish. Your file name is automatically searched through the vault and any mention of the same thing will be surfaced as an un-linked reference. These can be people, books, films, thoughts, in-fact whatever you want them to be.</p>\n<p>My set up is very simple in terms of folder structures, I have one for book notes, one for article notes, one for random notes, and a few others for People, Templates and Podcasts. This is not needed, all of the text files can be left in the root of the vault, but I like a nice clean look on the side. Everything can be searched for anyway, and in many ways you don’t even have to see the files to link them together.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b256c8e3be.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h3 id=\"daily-notes\">Daily Notes</h3>\n<p>My biggest strength now is recording absolutely everything that I need, or want to refer back to later. I used to save these things sporadically in Apple Notes and also Ulysses. Now Obsidian is open constantly while I am at my mac. Every time I open Obsidian it is on my daily note, this contains my daily tasks, meeting notes, Journal entries and almost anything in my life.</p>\n<p>When I first sit down in the morning I type out some Morning Notes. This has been my practice for months now and just helps me surface whatever is going on in my brain that morning. I don’t think very much about these, I try and get out of my own way and let my thoughts flow out. Admittedly some of this is repeating trends of how I am feeling, but quite often these thoughts turn into blog posts or just something I work on personally.</p>\n<p>My daily note also contains my Routines, these are simple things I am bringing into my daily routine to make myself better. Really simple things like walking the dog, meditating, exercising and anything else I am working on. You create a task by typing <code>- [ ] Task name</code>.</p>\n<p>To set up daily notes turn this on in the core plugins. There are also some options in settings to customise this a little. I set up my daily note to start from a Template, so I always have the same headings and tasks to tick off.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2b7999df22.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>I have another area for my aforementioned day notes, this allows me to take brief notes on meetings, telephone calls and also anything else that crops up in the day. I can’t tell you how beneficial this is for emptying my brain and writing down all my tasks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"plugins\">Plugins</h3>\n<p>While we talk about turning on plugins, now the real power of Obsidian starts to come out. You can use a whole range of plugins created by the community of developers out there that are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Plugins are split into ‘core’ and community. The Core plugins are optional things that Obsidian can do if you wish, and Community plugins are downloadable extensions to do extra things, some simple, some really powerful.</p>\n<p>You can also install plugins outside of the app that are easy to discover in their <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/community\">thriving community</a> or their Discord channel. From my experience most people don’t stray outside of the Community plug ins. I use the following heavily.<br />– <a href=\"https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin\">Calendar</a>: This shows a calendar in the right side bar, allowing you to go back to daily notes from those days or make daily notes on dates in the future.<br />– <a href=\"https://github.com/argenos/nldates-obsidian\">Natural Language Dates</a>: This allows you to easily tag things with dates by using <code>@today</code>or <code>@tomorrow</code> or even <code>@next week</code>.<br />– <a href=\"https://github.com/konodyuk/obsidian-text-expander\">Text Expander</a>: Does exactly what it says on the tin. Allowing you to customise short codes and replace them with regularly used bit of text.<br />– <a href=\"https://github.com/hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin\">Kindle Highlights</a>: Syncs by book highlights into my book notes folder in a similar fashion to Readwise.</p>\n<p>I have tried to make things as simple as I can, but also molded things to my usage. There are hundreds of community plugins to do loads of things and you can spend days of your life trying them out! One non community plugins that I have to mention will follow because it is the basis of how I get things done.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tasks\">Tasks</h3>\n<p>As mentioned about you can set tasks up really easily in Obsidian and there are load of plugins to help you manage these and keep ticking those check boxes off. To add a date to a task you simply tag it so for example.<br /><code>- [ ] Do this thing #2021–12–25</code></p>\n<p>This will make a task for you to complete that will be linked to the daily note on the 25th December 2021. You can go further and further with this and customise this until your heart is content, but this is task management in Obsidian 101.</p>\n<p>Wait, there are plugins though! After using <a href=\"https://github.com/larslockefeer/obsidian-plugin-todo\">Obsidian GTD</a> for a little while I opted to use <a href=\"https://github.com/schemar/obsidian-tasks\">Tasks</a>. The benefit of this was that I can get my set up to display the tasks I have to complete in a way that works for me. I have a note titled tasks that contains code to display my priorities that are overdue, need doing today and those that are upcoming. As well as having an Inbox of sorts by surfacing any task I have not allocated a date to.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3c2265cfd1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>Tasks also allows me to set up repeating tasks and displays the date I completed each task next to the item with a nice green tick emoji — I like that! I leave my Tasks note open in a second page by CMD + click.</p>\n<h3 id=\"book-article-notes\">Book &amp; Article Notes</h3>\n<p>Ever read something and thought it was great but immediately forgot all about it? Yeah me to, until I started making notes about it. When I read anything in Pocket, or on my Kindle at night, the highlights go into Obsidian for two reasons:<br />1. For me to refer back too later if i need to<br />2. For me to go over and expand on at a later date</p>\n<p>These notes may sit doing nothing, or may be expanded on and stored for later reference, either way they are not taking space up in my brain and have not been lost. The Kindle highlight plugin allows me to do this whenever I have finished a book and want write a little about it, if only a mini review. However I transfer over my Pocket highlights once a week or so for reference.</p>\n<p>Making notes in this fashion quite often comes out in my daily notes, or my writing later on, because a quick search or a glance at the links tab in the right sidebar will surface any relevant information to me. With a few keystrokes I can make sure these thoughts are connected up and begin to see my knowledge graph forming before my eyes.</p>\n<p>I tried this also with Podcast notes, which can be really useful when sycnced through the app <a href=\"https://www.airr.io\">Airr</a>. However since my <a href=\"/2021/05/12/my-podcast-feed.html\">listening declined</a> these have stopped completely.</p>\n<p>I was initially dismissive of making notes like this, and still do shy away from going as deep as I could. Some of this is trauma from University and making hours of notes, but some of this is just not what I use Obsidian for, but with that said it’s amazing the difference it has made. Simply by having them there and padding some of them out my recall of the topics discussed has been improved tremendously. If there is one thing I can’t stress it’s don’t me as dismissive as I was. Make loads of notes about everything.</p>\n<h2 id=\"writing\">Writing</h2>\n<p>This is one of the biggest things that I always wanted Roam to be. A place I could write out anything and it be stored and linked to if those topics come up again. Try as I might, I just never got there with Roam. There are options to turn it of, but first and foremost it likes things in bullets and blocks which felt to rigid and strange. Whereas Obsidian is text editor at its core, so writing is a delight.</p>\n<p>Everything I have ever written in a text file in my writing folder. Published or not it’s there and can come up again whenever the time is right. Whats more is that all my documents are written in my beloved markdown. So I can type away and never click a mouse button if I don’t need to! My search for a perfect writing app has changed back to storing everything in Markdown in Obsidian, so no more subscriptions. Publishing is as easy at copy and paste into micro.blog and put in my images.</p>\n<p>Using the very geeky comandline universal converting service <a href=\"https://pandoc.org\">Pandoc</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/OliverBalfour/obsidian-pandoc\">accompanying plugin</a>, I can also export my work documents and things I am working on to docx and pdf as and when required. I don’t really want to get in to setting this up because it is boring, but I might do at some point.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7bbf397c8e.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"mobile\">Mobile</h2>\n<p>I am lucky enough to have the beta version of the iOS app to test (it is available on Android too). This is a full featured app that works exactly like the desktop version. Meaning I can type in my notes, pull up any information I need, or even work on my iPad!</p>\n<p>The fact that a free service got here before a £195 one like Roam did is baffling to me. Bravo on the developers and the community to getting to this stage and deliver such a full featured app with very few caveats.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>And there you have it, my very simple setup in a nut shell. I’d like to cover concisely why Obsidian stuck for me this time, but I really have no idea. Many people I follow have started using it, and as such I gave it a little more time. It’s not Roam Research and that’s ok. I love it even more because its simple to pick up and you can get as geeky as you like.</p>\n<p>I have recently discovered some more plugins that I am experimenting with for creating templates and moving things even further forward. But for now the real benefit I get from this is being able to open it each morning and use it all day for the things it does best — recording my thoughts and linking them for me.</p>\n",

Somewhere in 2019 I fell off a bit as I didn’t have to drive as much, and the pandemic <a href=\"/2020/10/18/podcasts-and-me.html\">just killed almost all of my listening</a>. The empty space I used to fill with talking and chatting about tech is not just empty but I’t still consuming up a little <a href=\"/2021/02/15/why-do-i.html\">while running</a> or walking the dog. Chris Wilson <a href=\"/2021/02/15/why-do-i.html\">pestered me into</a> writing about what I am listening to, so here it is!</p>\n<h2>Wired UK</h2>\n<p>The only Tech thing I listen to now is a good round up of tech news that is actually interesting. It got a bit too much in the pandemic due to talking about research and related things to do with COVID but its back to its best. No spec stuff, no wild rumors to get emotional about, just stories and insight about how tech is changing the world. If you like the magazine, you’ll <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/podcasts\">love the podcast</a>.</p>\n<h2>Duncan Trussell Family Hour</h2>\n<p>My favorite person, perhaps on the planet (don’t tell my wife) never fails to entertain. With in-depth talk about life, reality, religion, psychedelics and almost anything goes. His insight into how he looks at the world has affected me deeply since discovering him on Joe Rogan a few years ago – <a href=\"http://www.duncantrussell.com\">I never miss an episode</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c35764757c.jpg\" width=\"666\" height=\"307\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2>Vox Conversations</h2>\n<p>This is a new one for me, I have only been listening a couple of weeks but have gone back and devoured a lot of the back catalog. It’s very political in places, and offers a very slanted view of the world, but has introduced me to some really good books and interesting people. I particularly enjoyed the recent episode on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/vox-conversations-podcast\">Satanic conspiracies in the US</a>.</p>\n<h2>Tim Ferris</h2>\n<p>What more is there to say about this podcast, it’s really great. I do dip in and out due to not having the attention or time for a 2hour + conversation but they are always a great listen. Tim has a great way of interviewing and bringing the very best our of people. His <a href=\"https://tim.blog/2020/10/27/yuval-noah-harari/\">show with Yuval Noah Harari</a> changed my outlook on life completely.</p>\n<h2>Darknet Diaries</h2>\n<p>If you’re following me and not <a href=\"https://darknetdiaries.com\">listening to Darknet</a> I don’t know what you’re doing with your life. This is one of my very favorite. It scratches my tech itch but in a completely different way. The story telling behind some of the greatest hacks in the world, and also some you’ve never heard of ,never fails to grab me.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Others worth mentioning:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p089sfrz\">Louis Theroux Grounded</a>, The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07nkd84/episodes/downloads\">Missing Crypto Queen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aubreymarcus.com/blogs/aubrey-marcus-podcast\">Aubrey Marcus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/project-human-zac-cichy-w1OZd9frbBY/\">Project Human</a></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"title": "How To Do An EE Digital eSim Swop",
				"content_html": "<p>Despite it being a standard feature in many Android phones it took Apple until the iPhone XS to implement <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT209044\">a dual sim of sorts</a>. Even then you need to have one as an eSim and that limits the networks that can support it. Thankfully EE were one of the first, so for the last few years I have been using two sims in my iPhone, one for work and one for personal.</p>\n<p>One major pain is dealing with moving phones. I do that quite a bit, so ordering a paper EE eSim each time became a pain, not to mention an expense at £1.50 a time. Preplanning helps a little, but there has still been times I’ve been without service because I’ve broken my phone and can’t just pop my sim in another.</p>\n<p>Thankfully EE have a solution, and you can now download an EE eSim for your iPhone in seconds! Here’s how to do a digital EE eSim swop.</p>\n<p>You will need your current sim to be working to receive a text message, and also have already set up your new handset and downloaded the <a href=\"https://ee.co.uk/ee-and-me/my-ee-app\">My EE app</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e6f6966773.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>Once you’ve done that on your new phone in the My EE app, open the menu and go to Settings &gt; Device and SIM &gt; Replace my SIM &gt; and select your number.</p>\n<p>You will then have two options on supporting devices, SIM card — Post (2 to 4 days) at a cost of £1.50. Or eSim — instant download at a cost of 50p.</p>\n<p>Tap on eSim, then select this device, and you’ll be on your way to transferring your number.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2e4f4fff01.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>You will then get a notification that the eSim is ready to download, and then you can go through the normal set up options. This gives you the facility to choose labels for the numbers, which iMessage number is used and lots of others. Once completed you will need to activate the new sim by receiving a text to your old phone, put the supplied code into the app on your new phone, and you’re ready to go.</p>\n<p>This is usually instant but can take up to  an hour, turn your new phone off and on again to refresh everything, and you’re good to go on your new handset with a new EE eSim.</p>\n<p>Head into Settings &gt; Mobile data to change any of the options you’re selected on set up. If in any doubt call 150 from a working EE phone.</p>\n",

Should you choose to make your Podcast more premium and charge your listeners, you will have to upload the audio straight to Apple. Closing off any chance of the show being available in another app, and removing RSS entirely.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5425e7bf4c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2>Anchor The Feed</h2>\n<p>I am no lover of podcast platform Anchor, and have been outspoken about their practices, but this <a href=\"https://mignano.medium.com/podcasting-rss-openness-and-choice-50223b1f16d0\">recent post</a> from its founder seems to be the most sensible move. Instead of launching a service to tie everything down, he talks about the love of the openness of the RSS-based industry, but also the issues that comes with it.</p>\n<p>Each platform that hosts content will have no choice to make a grab for premium content creators. Not because that is who they should be appealing to, but because they can’t miss out on it. Left unchecked Apple could not only take money from subscribers. They will also cut out advertisers, hosting platforms and even apps in their own App Store.</p>\n<p>It’s understandable that <a href=\"https://ljpuk.net/2021/04/22/its-time-to-leave-anchor/\">some podcasters</a> will start to get a bit jumpy, but most of these things are motivated by continued attempts to control the market. Open podcasting won’t go away, but the type of content that is available for free, or indeed in the place you want to consume it <em>will</em> dry up over time. We are well and truly in the boom time of audio focused content, which after a year of stalling due to COVID-19 could be a refreshing change.</p>\n<p>However, I have a feeling the market will right itself. This has happened to TV, video and blogging before, but there was still enough out there to consume. Perhaps those of us that have been listening for years have just had too much time in the sun? I don’t believe its time to get worried, there are a huge number of podcasters out there that are working away for free that deserve to be better supported. It’s time to wait and see, and support the creators you think need it most.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

Wasted thousands on tech purchases and waved any dismissive thoughts away with the reasoning that it was my only vice. Upgraded my phone, tablet, computer, and anything I could get my hands on almost constantly in a search for something better. When in fact it wasn’t better it was looking for, it was an answer.</p>\n<p>The next model of iPhone was always the one that would fill what I was looking for. No? It must be the next one coming in a few months then, or maybe I needed an iPad to go with it. Whatever the feelings left after the hit of dopamine had subsided, it was explained away with buying something else.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f77b66b4b3.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>That wasn’t what I was searching for though, I wanted something to fill another hole in myself. It didn’t matter what the hole was, but I filled it with buying tech. Simply because I thought it made me look cool on the internet. Although every upgrade offered me <em>something</em>, these things are not what I needed. What I, and load of people like me, needed was to get to the root of what I really wanted. What was I trying to mask and fill with buying things?</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until discovering minimalism that I became aware fo the feelings I had. Like many people I talk to, the <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80114460\">Netflix documentary</a> introduced me to a way of looking at the more essential things in life. Thinking much harder about the things I choose to put in it. This isn’t an advert for minimalism, but the message given is a powerful one. The thing I needed was not a thing at all, and for different people it is different things — but one thing links us all, it’s not stuff we need.</p>\n<p>These feelings haven’t gone away, I don’t think they ever will. They are still there, I bought every size of iPhone <a href=\"/2020/11/21/the-iphone-line.html\">simply because I could</a>, but how I deal with them is different. Being aware of feelings and the reasons behind them has been an important step in improving my overall happiness and seems to have curbed the never-ending search for fulfilment. Much simpler things make me content now, and when these pangs of purchases come I ride them out and think about what the root cause really is. It’s me.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

Doing things at the correct pace is one of life’s biggest lessons. That pace is going to be different for different people, and different times of day and hell even different periods of time.

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s only a few months since I covered <a href=\"/2020/08/22/my-reading-flow.html\">my reading flow</a>. It’s something that has changed a lot in the last year due. Motivated by my desire to take more advantage of the time spent engrossed in a book or catching up on my queue of online articles. This doesn’t matter when and where I am doing this, but one thing I’ve come to rely on is highlighting and being able to read them back.</p>\n<p>Only when testing two new upcoming reading apps (super top secret sorry) that are yet to implement highlights that I realised how important they are. Without even thinking I draw my finger across the screen to highlight a specific sentence or passage that I want to remember. When that doesn’t happen, I don’t feel like I am getting the best I can out of this experience.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b0c949c9ae.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Many things slide past without needing to be highlighted, but more than a few times I have had to put the article into another app so I can save the highlights for later. I <em>could</em> try to do this with <a href=\"/categories/shortcuts/\">Shortcuts</a>, but there is something about being able to see what you’ve read and which bits are important. Remember how satisfying it felt to bust out the marker and highlight things on your school texts?</p>\n<p>These highlights typically end up on social media, lead to a<a href=\"https://gr36.com/categories/link-posts/\">link post</a> or are saved to refer to later. <a href=\"https://readwise.io\">Readwise</a> definitely helps with pushing these into <a href=\"/2020/08/21/how-to-start.html\">Roam</a> for me, but there are a huge number of ways to read these highlights back and let the information sync in better. If you are thinking about using a service, or creating a new one, highlighting should be top of your list.</p>\n<p>Not everything needs highlighting, but everything needs to be able to be highlighted.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>For at least the last 4 years, each night I have taken off my Apple Watch, and placed it on a charger next to my bed along with my iPhone. So for the time I am asleep, or at least <a href=\"/2021/02/01/113519.html\">trying to be</a>, my phone is within arms reach on a standup charger.</p>\n<p>This helps tremendously as I always have a bedside clock on hand that glows with a subtle bump to the table, and I can be at the mercy of my alarm within a few seconds. But it also means that at any point I can reach over and entertain myself when I should be sleeping.</p>\n<p>We’ve all done it. “Just Checking” Twitter before going to bed and an hour disappears as you <a href=\"/2020/09/09/its-not-the.html\">descend a rabbit hole</a>. Or perhaps you see it light up as a notification comes in, and now you’re fully awake because the supermarket had a great offer for you at 2am. Thankfully I am one of the lucky ones that doesn’t need to be contactable at night, but I’ve only just realised that moving your phone into another room is the way to go.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/97204c6340.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>It was only through pure accident that the realisation hit me. I was ‘between’ phones and having to use an <a href=\"/2021/02/24/185046.html\">iPhone SE 2016</a> that relied on wired charging. As such it lived in my separate office for a couple of days until my new one arrived. Meaning everything was left until the morning, the extra effort to get out of bed, cross the hallway and retrieve my phone meant that I just left it alone.</p>\n<p>That bit of extra space meant I slept better, felt better and the difference was so stark that despite no longer relying on a charging cable, my phone dock now lives in the other room permanently. I hope it likes its new living space, along with all the accessories that go with it. I still do grab it sometimes but much less than before. I wish I had done this sooner.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I have seen people over the last few days start to wonder what to write about on their blog. Asking questions about the topics they cover and also publishing posts about <a href=\"https://chrishannah.me/the-evolution-of-what-i-write-about/\">what they aim to do</a>. It’s great to see more people typing out words and realising that it really doesn’t matter what you write about.</p>\n<p>Personal blogs are a strange thing, they are not new, they’ve been a round since pretty much the invention of the internet. For some reason or another they seem to be making a resurgence. Perhaps it’s the increased distrust in the places that bloggers left for, namely social media and others that aim to monetise you without paying you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2024/075c937ade.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>It could be a concoction of many reasons. The positive is they are coming back. Sure, they have never gone away for many people, but lots more are opening up to the idea of publishing things themselves. So many great platforms exist now where you don’t need special skills to publish, and you don’t need to brand yourself either.</p>\n<p>The need for a name or logo or fancy design is loosing its trend as publishing gains more relevance from your personal experience and your opinions. Citizen journalism has become immensely relevant as people lose confidence in main stream media, but are also becoming more closed off to outside ideas. So more people writing about more things and their personal experience of them can only lead to positive things.</p>\n<p>Pick a platform and do it. Let me know what’s going on in your life, the pictures you take, the articles you read and the thoughts you have on them. There are enough publications out there writing news, or reviews or whatever pays the bills. The internet needs your voice, however you see fit to share it. Cover everything and anything and publish it.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

Usually because they’ve done something stupid, or heinous and the powers that be no longer want them on their platform. It happens thousands of times a day, but it never fails to hit the news when someone popular gets the boot.</p>\n<p>When this happens, there are always some people who don’t agree. Followers and fans unite to collectively shake their fists at the service for a time, but soon enough things return to normal. Sometimes people leave in protest, and flock to services better suited to them. Which is exactly what should happen. Not everyone deserves a place on the internet, but the question is should being able to publish to the internet be a right or a privilege?</p>\n<p>Of course, these platforms are private companies. They can do as they wish and pull the plug on whoever and whenever they wish. Twitter is usually the last hold out, with <a href=\"/2021/03/19/was-this-correct.html\">some serious thought put into</a> making the right decision for their platform but also for the larger conversation. Platforms should be accountable for what is <a href=\"/2021/01/04/the-law-that.html\">hosted and posted on their service</a>, and suffer much less protection than they do in my opinion — but then to follow my logic where does it stop?</p>\n<p>Of course there is no question when it comes to anything illegal. I’m referring to misinformation and what has commonly come to be known as “fake news”. Conspiracy theories that are miss informed at their core or intentional in their deception.</p>\n<p>Are Amazon Web Services or Digital Ocean responsible for what’s on their servers when they have zero knowledge, and nor should they. There is no disagreement to not giving someone a platform to share abuse or hate, but I’m not sure where I come down on publishing to the web.</p>\n<p>Everyone has a right to free speech and the internet should be no different. What they are not immune to is recourse and debate, which is a healthy part of human interaction. Should every belief, however weird or wonderful be allowed?</p>\n<p>I am by no means an expert, and as with most things, this post is more of a public thought process that any kind of instruction. However, perhaps the answer is not removing the conversation entirely.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

For which I own loads of them — Apple Watch, iPhone 12 Pro, iPad Pro, iMac Pro, MacBook Pro (Pro all the things) — but these pale in comparison to my absolute favourite AirPods Pro.<br />\n<br />\nSince I purchased the original version within minutes of them going on sale, AirPods have been my go-to headphones for almost all situations. Before which I’d had a long stream of different ones and had to keep several around for different activities. I had Bose QC35 for music, Beats X for the gym and different headphones for running. Although I still put on some <a href=\"/2019/08/20/powerbeats-pro-review.html\">Powerbeats Pro</a> for long-distance running, the newer Pro AirPods replaced everything else with ease.</p>\n<p>What has further cemented their place in my heart has been the recent pandemic. They are invaluable for video calls, long telephone calls and catching me up with my <a href=\"/2020/10/18/podcasts-and-me.html\">podcast feed</a> whilst walking the dog.</p>\n<p>They are not perfect, but there are. It many things to improve. To mirror Gabz thoughts I love the physical buttons on the Powerbeats Pro, but it would be impossible to feature these in the small design. In fact, I would be hard pushed to think of any major improvements that would push me to upgrade to a new version. Even the battery life has been great for me, although that is bound to start to drop as they get older.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2024/a067433daf.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Sure the <a href=\"/2020/10/25/iphone-pro-thoughts.html\">iPhone 12 is great</a>, I quite <a href=\"/2020/04/22/using-an-ipad.html\">like my iPad</a> but is easy to pick my favourite device, and it’s also perhaps the cheapest one I have.</p>\n<p>When Apple talk about the Apple Watch as their most personal device, I’d have to also put my AirPods Pro in that category. They are never very far away from me, and even fit in that weird small pocket in my jeans, so I always know where they are.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->",

While the whole world can wax lyrical about the context and argue back and cowards about the correctness of the action. It’s this last sentence that the man in charge really shows the type of leader he is.</p>\n<p>It’s an important step in anyone’s journey through life. Realising that in many situations your point of view could be affected by a range of different things. More so when you interact with people, supervise interaction between people, or in Jacks case are in-charge of one of the largest, and fast-paced social networks in the world. Unfortunately, not everyone reaches this realisation at the same point in life, if at all.</p>\n<p>There is also an overwhelming tendency for CEO’s and ‘Silicone Valley Types’ to let their egos run sit front and centre of their personality and take the high road at every opportunity. So, when someone openly discusses their reasoning behind the decision and even questions themselves it proves a welcome breath of fresh air and has been something that has resonated with me.</p>\n<p>Questioning even what would appear a pretty simple decision proves overwhelmingly that nothing is ever that simple. From everything from product managers, to parents it’s important to think about not only the decisions you make, but help others understand how you got there and be open for dialogue. You may think, or know you ar making the right decision but even the right choices can be interpreted differently by others.</p>\n<p>There are an abundance of view points that it is impossible for anyone to consider, sure enough you don’t owe anyone an explanation at all. However, baring in mind how your decision can be perceived by others can mean to more understanding and more constructive feedback. It also might help you understand the designs you make more in-depth and lead to you being able to identify miss steps in your own though patterns early.</p>\n<p>When you think about Jacker leadership of twitter, and the apparent lack of action over the platforms the biggest issues his response makes perfect sense. The lack of action could be put down to over thinking and miss steps in management. When in fact his thread shows the level of thought that goes behind decisions that can bring in gigantic changes to a platform hundreds of millions of people use.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2024/3dd1b221b3.jpg\" /><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>It doesn’t exist. You can’t find everything you want from an app, it’s like finding a unicorn. You’re going to have to compromise in some areas to get something you’re happy with. These are all things I have heard said, or have been said to me when I have been looking for the perfect app previously. It doesn’t matter if it is a todo app, calendar app, or note-taking companion — the perfect thing just doesn’t seem to exist. Doesn’t stop me from looking though!</p>\n<p>I’ve been on a <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/03/searching-for-the-perfect-ios-markdown-writing-tool/\">Jason Snell’esk</a> search for a writing app, or service that can do everything that I need it to do. I started by outlining exactly what I needed and the ways I would attempt to rank the ability for this to be fulfilled. I needed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing app that was accessible and nice to write in. My eyesight is not what it was, so I sometimes like to boost the font size when in ‘focus mode’.</li>\n<li>Able to take quick notes</li>\n<li>Supports markdown. This can be either plain text or a modified version that hides some syntax, the important part is I can type it out because that’s just how my fingers work across a keyboard.</li>\n<li>Able to export as a PDF and Word document. I use these lots for storing documents for work use, and sending these out for approval. Word is what my bosses prefer to use.</li>\n<li>Works well across iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a2a1e14704.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"bear-notes\">Bear Notes</h2>\n<p>This is an app <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-keep-coming/\">I keep coming back to</a>. I tested the beta versions, and have been testing the upcoming new version extensively on both Mac and iOS. The ‘notes’ app is amazingly powerful, so much so I wouldn’t consider it a notes app at all as it can go toe to toe with much larger and expensive apps.</p>\n<p>It looks great, incorporates the best iOS features such as shortcuts and widgets, and I can export all notes in a rage of formats including text bundle that I can <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/bear-notes-app/\">publish straight to WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>However, I don’t love the tagging a system of organisation. I much prefer an inbox that I can sort and file things away. Where’s as by adding hashtags it gets some resemblance of order to it but still feels a little too chaotic with loads of notes.</p>\n<p>The exporting also lacks any level of customisation, and some styling of these takes a bit of editing before I can send.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/78affa505e.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"craft\">Craft</h2>\n<p>The new hotness in iOS text apps nudges in here simply because of how powerful it is. Not an app I would usually consider due to its strange way of doing things (I talk about this more in my newsletter) and it’s expense.</p>\n<p>With that said, Craft allows me to store almost every bit of text I could ever need from a simple note to writing a book if I ever needed too, all whilst looking brilliant and offering powerful export features.</p>\n<p>A massive positive is the organisation Craft uses, based on folders and areas, works more like my brain does. Meaning I can have an inbox full of ideas, work on writing posts, store information for my day job and be able to edit and export to email effortlessly.</p>\n<p>But… I just can’t get on board with some decision made with the app. Markdown is half-baked at best. For example, I cannot type in the image reference for an external image, it just disappears. Craft only support some Markdown syntax and not all of it, and there is also lots of UX weirdness I can’t wrap my head around.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f99ca5021d.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"ulysses\">Ulysses</h2>\n<p>My favourite writing app for many years and one that I only recently stopped using because I <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-didnt-want/\">moved away from Ghost</a>. At the time I felt it was one of those apps I paid for simply because I always had, and it felt over engineered for my usage. Built more for real writers rather than bloggers.</p>\n<p>It supports loads of iOS features such as shortcuts, allow me to store documents in folders and offers me a useful inbox. Ulysses is also fantastic at exporting in a range of different options and even allows for custom styling of them.</p>\n<p>My only downfall really is that it doesn’t work very well as a note-taking app, or at least it doesn’t feel like it does. Starting can sometimes be a bit slow, so I would potentially have to use Apple notes for smaller things which is no hardship.</p>\n<h2 id=\"back-home\">Back Home</h2>\n<p>Like some kind of cheating husband I have gone all around the houses only to realise the one <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1372593179501985794?s=20\">I recently left is the best fit for me</a>. There are a few things I’d love to see improved but in terms of ticking away at all the points above Ulysses fits me like a glove. When throwing my hands up in the air and re-downloading it the first launch just felt like home. As much as all these flashy new apps come on the scene, or I just start looking for no good reason, the tried and tested option is quite often the best.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Special mention to:</p>\n<p>iA Writer — I love the interface, but I don’t really want to mess around with a folder full of files.</p>\n<p>Byword — the same as above really, I used to love this app, but it feels left behind.</p>\n<p>Apple notes — too much weirdness in pasting in information, particularly links. For some strange reason it still doesn’t support CMD+K on iOS.</p>\n<p>I am sure there are plenty of others out there I didn’t try, please don’t tell me then, just let me live in blissful ignorance!</p>\n",

Instead of <a href=\"https://gr36.com/twitter-muscle-memory/\">scrolling Twitter</a> I now open up <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/reeder-5/id1529445840\">Reeder</a> or Pocket and catch up on things.</li>\n<li>Photos – I like to keep the camera and gallery app near by, at least until the <a href=\"https://gr36.com/the-iphone-needs-a-camera-button/\">iPhone gets a camera button</a>!</li>\n<li>Writing – everything goes in <a href=\"https://gr36.com/back-to-bear/\">Bear</a> now. I’m slowly migrating away from using <a href=\"https://gr36.com/my-writing-workflow/\">Roam</a> after falling out of love with it and wanting to spend less on digital services. It’s a great platform but it’s getting a bit lost and no proper app doesn’t help. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also have micro.blog as my main social media fix. I also find a lot to read here, as well as awesome photos. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wavelength-for-micro-blog/id1365158696\">Wavelength</a> is something I am thinking of using to start a small podcast.</p>\n<h2>Widgets</h2>\n<p>I mainly use Reminders to store things I need to do. However I am looking at bringing back something more robust for projects — hence Todoist and Things installed currently.</p>\n<p>The larger Headspace widget helps me remember to use it more often. I love meditation and it’s part of my <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2020-review/\">2021 improvements</a> to do it more often. The rest are self explainatory, <a href=\"/categories/shortcuts/\">Shortcuts</a> are always around here somewhere.</p>\n<p>Wallpaper by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AR72014/status/1368113276756844544?s=20\">AR7</a></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

They do this in a myriad of different ways, approach each one with a different angle or perhaps a different message, but the overall message delivered is ~you~ are not good enough without this thing.</p>\n<p>Your body isn’t good enough, your hair, your clothes, the car you drive, even the food you eat. Nothing that you are currently doing, or anything about your own self, is good enough compared to this thing. Just look at how happy these people are, having loads of fun and smiling all the time. Don’t you want to smile too?</p>\n<p>When you buy this thing, and only this thing we are selling, you will instantly feel better about yourself. You’ll be more attractive, look better and the sun will always shine. Of course when you do buy extra stuff you do feel good, at first. However it soon wears off and you will return to your normal state, and now feel bad for spending money and achieving nothing. So if buying this didn’t work, what <strong>is</strong> the answer?</p>\n<p>It’s getting something else of course. Now you’ve got this thing, here’s another thing to buy, and perhaps you will feel happy with that one instead. Around and around it goes, accumulating stuff, because you’re not enough, spending money you don’t have because banks will lead you money to help you have enough. All in search of something you are told you’ve lost.</p>\n<p>At what point <strong>are</strong> you enough? Where is your breaking point on this cycle of hate? Many people get all of these things and only <em>then</em> realise that they don’t make any difference. A truth we know right at the start.</p>\n<p>You are enough already, you have enough to make you happy — and even if you don’t, accumulating stuff isn’t the answer.</p>\n<p>You’re the answer.

No blogging, no posting, and very little social media updates other than a few <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17884476947085317/\">Instagram stories</a> celebrating each mini victory. Thats because I had a weekend filled with pain and very little sleep running 48 miles over two days.</p><p>I ran four miles, every four hours, for 48 hours and it was the most challenging thing I have ever done. I learnt a lot about myself and what I can actually do, all thanks to deciding to do something nuts to <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/gr36\">raise money for charity</a>. It has pushed me to awfully close to the limits in pain endurance, sleep deprivation and sheer mental toughness and I have to say I enjoyed it!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/e0fca394cd.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Looking back at the fitness stats it looks insane! I reached 640% of my move goal (600) on Saturday and more than 400% on Sunday also. Burning around 7,800 calories in three days is just mind blowing for me to think about. Sure, a long bike ride can equal it but combined with the stopping and starting every 4 hours meant it felt much worse than even running a marathon. I took in very little as my stomach just wouldn’t tolerate much, so I think I’ve dropped quite a bit of weight too! But enough about me.</p><p>Thank you to all of those that donated to <a href=\"https://newlifecharity.co.uk\">Newlife Charity</a>, this is one very close to my heart and one that has helped me out tremendously when no one else would. The thoughts of the children and families they help kept me going during the dark moments. Particularly those in the middle of the night, when every finer of my body is screaming at me to stop running. I was able to focus on getting through each run at a time knowing the money would be used to help people that are not as lucky as me, and desperately need support.</p><p>But this isn’t a sales pitch, it’s not a plea for more money, not a grab for attention. It is a thank you, those that have supported me through this, sent me message and congratulated me on the completion means a lot to me. When times are tough, I know people can pull together and offer support in whatever way they can.</p><p>Once again thank you to those that donated. I am resting up and recovering well.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I posted <a href=\"/2021/02/18/i-find-it.html\">this very tongue in cheek recently</a>. A brief thought that passed through my mind whilst walking my dog and listening to <a href=\"https://www.breakthetwitch.com/\">Break The Twitch</a>. Weirdly the act of posting it made that thought stick around longer than it would have, and it is a useful thing to remember.</p>\n<p>In my early teens I wanted to be a teacher, and only when I did some work experience and found out what it was actually like, were the rose-tinted glasses knocked from my eyes. It’s fair to say that I left University with not a clue what to do with the rest of my life, and worked retail for far too many years. From that day to this I have never even considered my job as my calling, but it is definitely something that I enjoy doing and will continue to do as long as possible.</p>\n<p>I find it quite strange, but admirable, that people know exactly what they want to do for the rest of their life from a very early age. Discovering a passion without even looking and locking in their ambitions to their laser focus.</p>\n<p>As the old saying goes “Do what you love, and you’ll never work another day in your life”. Of course, this presumes that the route to finding exactly what you love and making it your job is one that is straight forward and easy to navigate. You see, your passions take time to discover, and often need some effort to discover. As Stephanie O’Connell says, “You’re not born with it”.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Passion doesn’t arrive while waiting for inspiration to strike, it’s uncovered through action and work. Think of it like falling in love. You don’t just sit at home and decide you’re going to fall in love with a certain person, you go out and share different experiences with different people until you do. – <a href=\"https://stefanieoconnell.com/truths-pursuing-your-passion/\">Stephanie O’Connell</a>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is also a big presumption in this saying that you <em>can</em> turn your passion into a job that supports you. That can be a pretty big ask from some pursuits, and presumes you have the skills to ‘sell it’. Hustle and grind are words we see banded around as if everyone can do anything with enough work, but what if you just don’t have the skills or the ability to do it.</p>\n<p>There is something to be said about hard work and dedication, but of course ability needs an environment to be able to flourish. For every person that beats all the odds and lives the dream, there are millions grinding away and <a href=\"https://gr36.com/do-whatever-you-need/\">doing what it is that they need to do</a>. Or simply cannot get to where they need to be to realise their passion.</p>\n<p>In my mid-twenties I decided I wanted to write. In my mid-thirties I decided I wanted to learn to code and improve my design skills. Perhaps in my forties there might be something else and I still don’t consider myself anything like the grown ups my teachers told me I had to become. There is something quite freeing of admitting this to myself and I wish I knew this earlier in life.</p>\n<p>I wonder how many people still don’t know what they want to be when they grow up. I just know what I am right now, and that’s ok.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2024/b3ab9197e2.jpg\" /></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>Perhaps avoid is the wrong word, but we’ve all felt that annoyance that we opened the app to send a quick tweet and all of a sudden time has disappeared. There are a number of ways to avoid this and the <a href=\"https://gr36.com/twitter-muscle-memory/\">Twitter muscle memory</a> that goes with it, but getting <a href=\"https://gr36.com/needing-feedback/\">feedback from my blog posts</a> is still an important loop for me to fill.</p>\n<p>So, the indieweb comes to the rescue and provides much of what I seek through webmentions. By using <a href=\"https://brid.gy/\">Brid.gy</a> I can receive a webmention to my WordPress blog whenever someone likes or replies to my post. I can check these every so often, or set it up pretty easily to get an email if someone replies.</p>\n<p>All of these responses poll through Bridgy every so often, and then if a link is found that accepts web mentions, it is forwarded to my WordPress Blog.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5283\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f1e73d7b6f.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2572\" height=\"542\" /></p>\n<p>After me approving them, likes and comments show up as native comments, with avatar and a link straight to the tweet.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5284\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8456ca5285.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1732\" height=\"1584\" /></p>\n<p>It is an elegant solution collecting feedback on your work, and not having to check and reply to things.</p>\n<h2>Replying to a web mention</h2>\n<p>If the reply or wingback is from a page that supports webmentions I can reply to it straight from my blogs comments section. For example, when my post appears on micro.blog and someone replies, I can click reply in the comments and it replies straight back to them on micro.blog as if I was using the website.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, nothing exists to the do the same on Twitter so if I need to reply I have to head over to Twitter. But I can got straight to the tweet with a click and reply easily.</p>\n<p>This has helped to avoid these rabbit holes I disappeared down and made me a bit happier the times I did visit Twitter to scroll through.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>There are numerous things that I cannot remember when and why I started doing, I just do. But running I know exactly when and why. I was in my second year of secondary school, and we were doing cross country. I’d never been a highly active kid, but it was a nice day, and I couldn’t be bothered to walk it like the ‘cool’ kids did, so I ran.</p>\n<p>Turns out I quite enjoyed it, and despite what half the school would tell you, it was lots of fun. Even more shocking to me was that I was actually rather good at it too. That was the day I started to run, and it improved that day tremendously. I went to my next class with a big smile on my face. To this day I’ve never stopped.</p>\n<p>I ran at first because it made me feel good. I got faster and people started pushing me faster still. I started to run races, and win medals, and the pushing never stopped. Very quickly I became to hate running, because it was no longer enjoyable, it was a chore and one I had to do at set times, distances, and speeds.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, I no longer run for gold anymore, but I still run. Most days I lace up my trainers and go out for a run, and the benefits to me are huge. Getting my blood pumping, clearing my lungs and my mind and making me feel so much better. I don’t focus on running every fast, and don’t set out to even cover certain distances I just go out and see what happens. Despite <a href=\"https://gr36.com/injured-best-thing-health/\">discovering cycling last summer</a>, nothing has ever replaced the feeling I get from running. It has become part of me, just something I do.</p>\n<p>People do ask, but I never have to ask myself why I run.

Of course they should let users know what is being tracked and the information being used. In fact, the surprising part is that it’s taken until now for something so obviously Apple to be introduced.</p>\n<p>It is one of those “of course they should do that” moments for people that follow along with Apple, but will it actually mean a lot to the end user? This is a hard question to answer. While average users are definitely becoming more aware of the issues surrounding some companies, look at the <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/whatsapp-flap-shows-importance-of-message-platform-to-facebook/articleshow/80874101.cms\">uproar directed towards a fairly mundane policy update</a> for WhatsApp. Users are still using Facebook in their billions despite all of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html\">issues</a> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-civic-groups-internal-docs-capitol-riot-misinformation-hate-2021-2?r=US&amp;IR=T\">surrounding</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona\">them</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21444205/mark-in-the-middle\">during</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/20/21375381/facebook-qanon-purge-content-policy-tide-pods\">the last</a> few years.</p>\n<p>So, silly me, was expecting a clear and concise sum up of the app you are looking to download. For it to be displayed clearly. Allowing the user to know exactly what they are going to install on their phone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2024/dcfccef7e5.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>What we actually got feels like a token gesture to use as a signal to their customers they are fighting for you. Yet it is buried away at the bottom of the listing, underneath the rest of the information that no body reads. They might as well have put it in the terms and conditions of their devices because it stands about as much chance of being read.</p>\n<p>This half step, which took an age to make, is frankly pretty pointless. I struggle to understand why the big companies kicked off so much in the first place. Most of them have been allowed to get away with pretty much whatever they like anyway. Remember Facebook <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/linked/the-background-data-and-battery-usage-of-facebooks-ios-app/\">playing silent audio</a> because of a ‘bug’? Or using <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/\">enterprise certificates</a> to get more data on users, with very little recourse. Remember <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16343304/uber-location-tracking-opt-out-apple-ios11\">Uber tracking the hell</a> out of pretty much every iOS user? Apple clearly needed to make a change, but this pathetic attempt is more PR than a privacy upgrade.</p>\n<p>Perhaps I am missing something, perhaps there is more going on behind closed doors and we are getting a privacy upgrade, but these labels will make pretty much zero difference, and I can’t understand why it stopped <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/02/12/google-youtube-iphone-update/\">Google updating it’s apps</a> at all.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

That is just what I’ve <em>always</em> done, well for the last 12 years anyway, and that habit is proving almost impossible to break. If thoughts arise, they are flung onto the internet in the quickest possible time!</p>\n<p>This isn’t restricted to the mobile app either. In fact, I haven’t had it installed for weeks, but I can open Safari, and be browsing through Twitter before I even register what is going on. Every spare moment when I could be bored, my hand instinctively reaches for my phone. I don’t even think it has anything to do with the service, it is simply a behavioral habit that is almost impossible for me to break. The muscle memory of years of usage is so powerful that I can’t switch it off without expending <em>a lot</em> of energy.</p>\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/6e75110cba.jpg\" />\n<p>There are two options really, I could start jumping up and down, blaming Twitter and cursing designers. Without a doubt that does play a part, but as I have talked about before I don’t <a href=\"/2020/09/09/itxs-not-the.html\">blame the internet for my issues</a>, I lay them at my feet. My other option, the path I am choosing, is to recognize these traits and slowly break them without giving myself a bad time. Where I would usually feel down, buy a smaller phone or some other radical move, I do something else or write a blog post just like this one!</p>\n<p>I do want my <a href=\"/2020/09/01/the-trickle-down.html\">attention back</a> from these types of actions, I don’t want behaviors like this to be so ingrained I can’t help it. However, the muscle memory runs so deep I may never be able to fix it completely. There is nothing wrong with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_time\">dead time</a> if used correctly and being busy helps quite a bit.

Head into your Labs section, turn on Members and at the bottom under Email Newsletter settings paste in your Mailgun API and the domain you are using.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6fac857dfa.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p>If in doubt click on the links under the boxes to head straight to the area you need in Mailgun. Don’t forget to change your region to EU if you have an EU flag next to your domain.</p>\n<p>This will enable you to send all your ‘bulk’ emails.</p>\n<h2 id=\"set-up-smtp\">Set Up SMTP</h2>\n<p>Depending on where you host your Ghost blog, this part may not be needed, however if your on <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/how-to-host-your-own-ghost-blog-on-digital-ocean/\">Digital Ocean like me</a>, you’ll need to send your transactional emails by SMTP and not direct from your server.</p>\n<p>SSH into your droplet and</p>\n<pre><code>nano /var/www/ghost/config.production.json\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then copy in this code to replace the mail JSON item that is there already. Changing the “user” and “pass” to your own Mailgun details.</p>\n<p>If you have a droplet in the EU change the “host” to your version.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">“mail”: {\n“from”: “Your name ”,\n“transport”: “SMTP”,\n“options”: {\n“service”: “Mailgun”,\n“host”: “smtp.mailgun.org”,\n“port”: 465,\n“secureConnection”: true,\n“auth”: {\n“user”: “your_user_name”,\n“pass”: “your_password”\n}\n}\n},\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also set the email you want these transaction emails to appear from as this is different from your newsletter ones. An email address that is in use anyway is advisable to avoid spam filters.</p>\n<p>This should allow you to send all of your transactional emails.</p>\n<h2 id=\"check-domain-and-ssl\">Check Domain And SSL</h2>\n<p>This is the part that drove me crazy. I have set everything up and still my Ghost members subscribe from did not work. This was due to a miss match in the domain set up in my production.json. So head back into there:</p>\n<pre><code>nano /var/www/ghost/config.production.json\n</code></pre>\n<p>And check right at the top where it says “URL” that this is https:// and not http:// if you are using SSL – which you will be.</p>\n<pre><code>“url”: “https://YOURDOMAIN”,\n</code></pre>\n<p>Your sign up form should now be working correctly and you can start gaining subscribers!</p>\n",

Thankfully this is quite the opposite.</p>\n<p>Since <a href=\"/2021/01/28/i-didnt-want.html\">moving my blog back to WordPress</a> I’ve been looking at what to do with my newsletter. It was the biggest sticking point that almost sent me back a step, but I am much happier posting to the indieweb. So I began looking around. The trendy <a href=\"https://www.getrevue.co\">Revue</a> was an option however importing old issues was a Hughe issue. I settled eventually on the place where everyone else is – Substack.</p>\n<p>As time went on and I got things set up, I just couldn’t get comfortable with this. There is nothing wrong with the service, and loads of people use it happily. I just have a few worries about services giving things away for free, they always eventually have to recoup it somewhere (looking at you Medium). There also is no way to turn off tracking, another thing I am not comfortable with. As such I just didn’t want to get invested in a service that I wasn’t 100% on.</p>\n<p>So I built my own version. <a href=\"https://email.gr36.com\">Greg Thinks Things</a></p>\n<p>This will make it easier for signing up, viewing old versions and means I can keep control of everything from start to finish. No tracking, no third parties – just me and you like an email should be.</p>\n<p>If you’ve subscribed already nothing changes. The emails will come to you from my personal email address and you can just email me back if you want to get in touch. I’m looking forward to sending the next one so if you’ve not signed up already there is no better time to do it.</p>\n<p>Also my membership is no more. Thank you to all those that have been contributing, the money had 100% gone towards hosting. I will look at options to offer a paid service with perks I the future depending on how things go.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2024/8033a78057.jpg\" /></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"title": "The Non Gamers Guide To Google Stadia",
				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I don’t play many games. I tell myself that this is because I don’t have time, but really it’s because I have such an addictive personality that I’m scared I’ll lose myself in to it, and I’ve got things to do! I don’t have any console, but turns out I did have things I could use to play Google Stadia and I bet you do to.</p>\n<p>What motivated all this was the fact there are some games that I want to play. You know those titles that everyone around you seem to be playing, and you just want to join in. The last title that did this to me was Red Dead Redemption 2 that I purchased a PS4 pro to play and before the month was out sat gathering dust, ending up being sold on a little later.</p>\n<p>This time it’s Cyberpunk 2077. A title that I really didn’t want to have to buy hardware to run it, and <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-10-cyberpunk-2077-is-super-rough-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-and-the-memes-have-already-begun\">really don’t want to pick up an old console</a> to play it either. So, this is where Google Stadia comes in. The cloud streaming service that has been steadily improving over the last few months after poor release reviews, but might just be the place to play without having to splash too much cash on top of the line hardware.</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>Googles solution to next-generation gaming is a streaming service that offers top of the line graphics without having to stump up the money for hardware. It’s a future that has been promised for some years now, and all of a sudden we have a few competing platforms that don’t work together.</p>\n<h2>What do you need?</h2>\n<p>Google Stadia requires very little to get you gaming. The most important of these things is a good internet connection. It doesn’t have to be the fastest in the world, but it needs to be reliable. In order to game wherever I wanted I’ve had to upgrade my router, but that shouldn’t be needed for most people. You will also need to check your data caps because you reusing upwards of 5GB per hour.</p>\n<p>As far as hardware, you’ll first need a controller, any old one will do, I’ve been using a PS4 one I borrowed from a friend. As long as you can pair it with a mobile device you can get up and running in no time. One thing to bear in mind is that new Xbox controller don’t pair with all computers. You can stream stadia to ‘any device that runs chrome’. I’ve used my MacBook, iPad, iPhone and an ancient Chromebook all with good results. It also works flawlessly with mobile safari and also desktop Microsoft Edge.</p>\n<p>You <em>can</em> splash for a Stadia specific controller if you like. Which I eventually did and picked one up for £35 from CEX, but they are available direct from Google. Opt for the Premier edition if you can afford it for £80, and you’ll get a Chromecast ultra too. This means you can play on your TV with ease but again you can pick these up cheeper at resellers.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/89a85c0b39.jpg\" alt=\"Stadia Final Google 1\" title=\"Stadia-Final-Google-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" /></p>\n<h2>What can you play?</h2>\n<p>Not every game is available on Stadia so don’t get too excited. There is a large range of games that are growing all the time like Cyberpunk 2077, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Hitman 3 (soon). However, there are loads of games missing, so this won’t replace a home console completely — yet. One noticeable absence for me is FIFA 21, but it’s <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2020/11/05/fifa-21-google-stadia/\">coming early this year</a>.</p>\n<p>If you sign up for a free stadia account you’ll get a copy of Destiny 2 and Bomberman online completely free. Opt for the Pro subscription, and you can choose from a whole range of games to play for free while your subscription is live.</p>\n<h2>How well does it work?</h2>\n<p>On its initial launch Google Stadia was littered with poor connection issues and huge lag. Thankfully, this is pretty much gone. Lag will depend on your internet connection first, which I have a pretty stable and fast one. There are some impossible to diagnose issues that sometimes crop up, usually ISP related and can be solved by rebooting your rooter.</p>\n<p>The UI of webpages or native apps takes a little getting used to as well as working out the options you have available when signing up. Hopefully, as the service becomes more main steam things like this will improve.</p>\n<p>Finding games and starting one from your library could use some work, but when it comes to playing, I have experienced very few issues in my super-fast internet bubble.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cccc32dc71.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021 01 03 at 13 12 53 1\" title=\"Screenshot-2021-01-03-at-13.12.53-1.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"1000\" height=\"463\" /></p>\n<h2>What does it cost</h2>\n<p>There are quite a few moving parts here, and the website is <a href=\"https://stadia.google.com/\">more than a little confusing</a>. Google of course push you towards signing up without much information. To play Cyberpunk 2077, which is all I set to do, it set me back the price of the game (£50). I borrowed a controller and used an iPad I already had.</p>\n<p>There are two free games included with your account Destiny 2 and Bomberman Online, so you can start playing for free. Opt for a ‘Pro’ subscription for £8 a month, and you can claim any of a growing range of games. However, you can only play this while you have an active subscription. Outside the games a pro subscription allows you to stream in 4k, with HDR also available depending on the speed of your internet connection.</p>\n<p>There is a free month trial with no purchase necessary to try out a few games and get the feel of the place. Allowing you to play all currently available pro games for a month without a charge. Google sell a Premier Edition controller and Chromecast Ultra for £80 which is the most versatile option, but you can pick these up for very little money in other places.</p>\n<p>Games vary in price from a few pounds to large amounts depending on the package you wish to buy.</p>\n<h2>Sum Google Stadia up for me</h2>\n<p>If like me, you want to play the occasional game and don’t want to spend hundreds on hardware. Chances are you can get going with things you already have or for very minimal outlay. Unfortunately, not all games are available but there is a large library of releases.</p>\n<p>The most important thing you will need is a fast, stable connection. If that sounds like you, Stadia is a great way to play almost anywhere.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

Instead of making you feel out of place, Fitness Totals places the emphasis on your weekly and monthly activity totals.

Meaning that you can tailor the experience to your taste and view the data you value, whenever you need it.</p>\n<p>I have been testing the app through its beta period and finding it extremely useful for comparing those stats that really matter to me. Having taken up cycling this year, and particularly enjoying walks with my dog, it’s great to get all the data I value but not have to worry about starting workouts or feeding my information into another service. Fitness Totals plugs straight into Apple Health and uses on device processing, so your data <a href=\"https://fitnesstotals.com/#container02\">never leaves your phone</a>. You <em>can</em> send your fitness totals to others if you choose to. The sharing features are particularly useful for a bit of friendly competition and give you a bit of a push!</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re active like me or just thinking about a New Year’s resolution. You can download <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1493350670\">Fitness Totals</a> from the App Store for just £2.99 and keep focused on your health.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’ve been delving into origin stories of some of my sons favourite superhero’s and it got me thinking about mine. You might think I have been around here for ages. Bleating on about Apple news like some kind of village idiot and generally writing things no one reads. However, my Apple usage has been a relatively short one, and started at random points during the last 10 years.</p>\n<p><strong>iPhone</strong></p>\n<p>I came to the iPhone really early in its life but was gone quickly. I managed to convince my mum to get me an iPhone 3G on a ridiculously expensive monthly contract about 2 weeks after it came out. At the time I had a Nokia N73 and touchscreen phones were the way to go, but nothing came close to the iPhone.</p>\n<p>After this brief time with a 3G I left and never looked back. Then began a long stream of Android phones that when I look at now, although fun to use, never lived up to an iPhone. The problem was, iPhones were much more expensive and exclusive to one network, which meant they were impossible to consider for quite a while.</p>\n<p>I resisted is as long as I could but came back again to the iPhone 5s. It was the first iPhone for a while reviewers were raving about and I was looking for something to work with my iPad. Couple this and my blossoming love for the iMac meant that an iPhone just made sense.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/69456a8f5b.jpg\" alt=\"MagSafe Wallet iPhoen 12 Pro Max 1 1\" title=\"MagSafe-Wallet-iPhoen-12-Pro-Max-1-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" /><strong>iPad</strong></p>\n<p>When the iPad first came out I wanted one, but couldn’t get hold of one anywhere. It was months later before I got my hands on one as a Christmas present. I liked the idea of being able to play games with my kids on it and Lucie loved swiping around on the screen. This felt like the future to me, but it stayed very much a consumption device and the initial excitement faded into the background.</p>\n<p>At the time I was hardcore into Android and had a long stream of new tablets to try out through my day job. I then didn’t pick up an iPad again until I moved into a new career and was handed an iPad Air as my main device. I didn’t really know what to do with it, but had to complete site visit reports on it so it also became my Laptop.</p>\n<p>I poured over <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-2-review-why-the-ipad-became-my-main-computer/\">guides from MacStories</a>, downloaded editorial guides and a year or so later began to lose hours of my life to the new hot thing that was Workflow. I bought a Logitech keyboard cases to go with it and never used anything else other than my iPad when I wasn’t sat at a desk. It became my computer a long time before Apple started marketing it as one, and before it came the new hotness to brag about on Twitter.</p>\n<p><strong>Mac</strong></p>\n<p>I began using a MacBook alongside an Android phone simply because Windows PCs became unappealing to me. When looking for a new laptop in a local electronics store I was encouraged to have a look at a MacBook. I am sure this was to try and upsell me something, but I was unimpressed with Windows 8 and really didn’t want to mess around with it any longer.</p>\n<p>Over the next few weeks I did some research and settled on a used MacBook Pro. I bought this through Facebook, and picked it up the next day. I have no idea what model it was but it was in incredible shape and did me proud. A few months later I picked up a new MacBook Air for a steal as it was being replaced by a new version. This was the old non-retina version and although great it didn’t quite live up to my old MacBook Pro.</p>\n<p>About six months later I picked up a New MacBook Pro Retina on Boxing Day sales and my life with a Mac continued ever since. When I began podcasting a lot I picked up a second hand iMac from the head of our IT department and only upgraded this last year to an iMac Pro.</p>\n<p>My journey into the Apple ecosystem has been a long one but an interesting one. The reverse of many other stories I have heard, as most then to start with an iPhone and go from there. I have considered trying to <a href=\"https://gr36.com/considering-jumping-the-walls/\">jumping the walls</a> a few times in the past, but never manage it. The Apple Echo system just suits me, and its simply where I feel most at home.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"title": "The MagSafe Wallet on Each Size iPhone",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>Yeah, I’m <em>that</em> guy this year. I couldn’t decide which iPhone size I wanted, so I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1327606056562925569?s=20\">got them all</a>. It’s a weird position to be in but also provides me with some deeper insights into the real differences. I am not talking about specs and all those kinds of figures that people get too caught up in, the real things that make a difference to actually using the device. One of the strangest ones I have had to think about this year is the MagSafe wallet — so here is how it fits with each size iPhone.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"MagSafe-Wallet-iPhone-12-Mini-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dab53b524a.jpg\" alt=\"MagSafe Wallet iPhone 12 Mini 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>iPhone 12 Mini</h2>\n<p>The smallest of the bunch is, somewhat understandably, the worst one regarding the MagSafe wallet. The iPhone 12 Mini is the same width as the wallet and the magnet position mean it goes all the way to the bottom of the phone also.</p>\n<p>Meaning no margin for error, but a nice neat look and a perfect fit — in theory. In reality this means it’s the hardest to get on fully, and it’s also the easiest to move off the edge of the phone. The small size of the iPhone 12 Mini also means that it is the hardest to get off when you need to get a card out. Mainly because the only option you have is pushing it down from the top not side to side.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Magsafe-Wallet-iPhone-12-Pro-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/06439a696b.jpg\" alt=\"Magsafe Wallet iPhone 12 Pro 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>iPhone 12 Pro</h2>\n<p>The best compromise in the sizes of iPhones is arguably the best size to use the MagSafe wallet with. When fitting the wallet you have some room around the phone to position the wallet securely if you don’t get it right straight away. Also some space on the back of the phone to remove the wallet easier when you need to get a card out.</p>\n<p>It lacks the neatness of the iPhone 12 Mini, but doesn’t look too bad at all. I have also found that when using the MagSafe wallet on the back of your iPhone 12 Pro or iPhone 12, the phone is easier to hold. I feel much more comfortable using my phone out the house without a case when the wallet is attached enabling a bit more grip.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"MagSafe-Wallet-iPhoen-12-Pro-Max-2.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4adbbe06b7.jpg\" alt=\"MagSafe Wallet iPhoen 12 Pro Max 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>iPhone 12 Pro Max</h2>\n<p>If you’ve read this far, you’re interested in what the MagSafe wallet is like with the biggest iPhone ever! The iPhone 12 Pro Max is humongous so there is no getting around that the wallet looks, well a bit weird!</p>\n<p>There is quite a bit of room around the wallet, given the expansive slab of glass. It also moves around quite a bit when you are trying to use the phone, due to needing significant hand gymnastics. Quite often the MagSafe Wallet will move from side to side, and occasionally making me a little nervous!</p>\n<p>The positive is that there is plenty of room for you to move the wallet to the correct position if you get it wrong. However, I would love to see a bigger version for the Pro Max simply so it doesn’t look so lost on the back of the phone.</p>\n<p>MagSafe, especially the wallet, feels a little like version one so I am sure we will see revisions on future phones. Stronger magnets and better connections are a must as well as different sized accessories. However, the MagSafe wallet is a great addition to my fairly minimal lifestyle, so I’m pretty happy so far.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

I happily posted a picture on Twitter and all of a sudden quite a few people wanted to ask questions about it. So, I thought I might as well answer them all at once.</p>\n<h2>How Many Cards Can You Fit In It?</h2>\n<p>There is space for three cards to fit, that’s it. No more. However, the case is quite a snag fit so you won’t have any issues using one or to cards in there without them falling out.</p>\n<p>There is also obviously no space for money, it’s very minimalist.</p>\n<h2>What Colour Did You Get</h2>\n<p>I opted for Baltic Blue, which pairs really well with the Pacific Blue iPhone 12 Pro I have, and also the Blue silicone case I occasionally use.</p>\n<h2>How Strong Are The Magnets</h2>\n<p>The real question we all wanted to know. The short answer is they will be fine. However, the longer one is, probably not as strong as they should be.</p>\n<p>When in use I don’t think the wallet will slide off without you knowing about it, but it doesn’t sit nearly as solidly as the iPad Magic Keyboard. Particularly at the bottom it doesn’t take much force to move it around, and when using the phone you can feel it move around some times.</p>\n<p>The reality is if you are not paying attention and wearing slim fitting trousers it may come off when you put your phone in your pocket. Using the wallet with a case adds a bit more friction, but I would like to see the address in a future update — I don’t think it is as secure as it should be.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f79f8fdafe.jpg\" alt=\"Magsafe wallet split 1\" title=\"Magsafe-wallet-split-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" /></p>\n<h2>Can You Charge With It On?</h2>\n<p>Nope, not at all, no wireless chargers work with the wallet attached. Not only it is probably too thick, but the wallet is shielded so you don’t ruin your cards, so nothing will get through anyway.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"title": "Pixel 5 Review",
				"content_html": "<p>It’s been three years since I used a Pixel device. Not since the first version was I even motivated to pick one up and try it out. They all excelled in specific areas, but always suffered from some frankly j<a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-2-xl-issues-so-far-813985/\">aw-dropping issues</a> or <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/b7mp23/is_anyone_else_facing_major_ram_management_issues/\">hardware omissions</a> — and when they somewhat sorted it all out with the Pixel 4 they wanted to charge premium prices and <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-4-issues-1054820/\">not deliver</a> on the premium part.</p>\n<p>Something changed with the Pixel 5. Amid a pandemic Google began to focus on what they could do to bring a device together, and perhaps what their customers wanted. So instead of <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-4-soli-motion-sense-1042448/\">weird and wonderful</a> new developments they absolutely promise to develop, they took half a step back. Creating a device that leans on tried and tested hardware, not the bleeding edge. Just reliable specs, done well and priced at a point that Google felt it can complete.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://store.google.com/gb/product/pixel_5?gclid=CjwKCAjw0On8BRAgEiwAincsHNJ2zr7wBqvtHDfeD8bwGDEkvQWGWYE-tFkgIjoHNXlj6l2ERLyVKhoCKmoQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds\">£599 in the UK</a> (yay for no mmWave) it is a steal of a smartphone. Googles very own Android version, on hardware chosen to run it at peak optimisations — or at least thats what we are led to believe.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br /><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8335452151565777\" data-ad-slot=\"6575033860\"></ins><br /><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n<h2>Mid-tear Performance</h2>\n<p>Despite there being loads of progress in this middle-top section (between £400-£800) the Pixel has an advantage that it is Googles flagship. So, it gets more development attention than many phones at this price point. While some companies cut things out to save costs and also not overshadow their top-tier handsets, Google can put in as much as they can for the price point they want to hit. While augments can be made that the Pixel 5 doesn’t have the bleeding edge of everything like other flagships, when you look at a phone such as the Note 20 Ultra, the Pixel 5 is half the price.</p>\n<p>In actual use these supposed cuts are mostly nowhere to be found. The Snapdragon 765G provides more than enough power for every situation. Sure it isn’t as powerful as the 865, but who actually uses the power that these chips possess? I would challenge anyone that uses this phone to find any stutter or lag, or any situations where the thought of having a more powerful processor ever crops up. Even whilst gaming and editing images the phone never misses a beat — I am sure you could find lag somewhere that is caused directly by the processor but I have never seen it.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"hand-and-box-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/be3005a7e7.jpg\" alt=\"Hand and box 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"476\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Usability</h2>\n<p>In fact, this ‘cut’ leads to battery life that is truly unbelievable. Let me say that again because it has never happened on a Google phone before — the battery life is insanely good. In fact, I can’t kill it! 8 hours screen on time is achievable, and some of my more leisurely days this week I got almost two days of use. Something helped by Googles option for a more reserved battery life processor, and no doubt software optimisations, squeezed every minute possible out of the 4080mAh battery.</p>\n<p>Use it a lot I did because it is such a delight to use. The build quality feel, the ergonomic design and this hardware combination make a hard to resist package. Whilst the screen is a long way off the highest resolution on the market, its 6inch 1080 × 2340 (432 ppi) is one you won’t find major issues with, but it is very dim and the auto-brightness terribly slow.</p>\n<p>Some slowdown or issues you may usually find in mid range hardware is smoothed out by the 90hz. Colours are natural and very pleasing to the eye, while text is sharp and the screen is all around absolutely fine to use. As we find with many of the choices made when building the Pixel 5, many words are written about the lack or this and that — but when you actually use it the phone, you realise what really matters.</p>\n<p>There is no XL version this year, meaning that the Pixel 5 sits somewhere between the two, and with slim bezels and all metal build. In my opinion, this phone is the best feeling smartphone this year. The design may put some off as boring or utilitarian, but in a world on folding smartphones and weird innovations, Goole have carved out a simple but pleasing ‘candy bar’ smartphone that is both functional and still notably a Pixel.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br /><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8335452151565777\" data-ad-slot=\"6575033860\"></ins><br /><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n<p>The Sage colour I have is the only colour you should consider, the black version just doesn’t have the same appeal as the mottled green matte resin Google have covered the back in. This covering over the Aluminium body provides some rigidity to the design, meaning that wireless coils can be covered up, and the device always feel welcoming.</p>\n<p>The design only broken by a slightly recessed fingerprint sensor, one that is fast and reliable and secure. It is a little strange to go back to rear mounted sensors after using more modern biometric options, but after a few moments it becomes smooth and natural, and you begin to wonder why things ever changed. Face unlock is fine, but this phone was designed in a pandemic, so you can understand the switch.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Camera-shot-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3efad4075a.jpg\" alt=\"Camera shot 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"504\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Camera</h2>\n<p>Since the very first version, Google put all its marketing and development into the Pixel Camera. It took top marks on DxOMarkMobile then, and has ranked very highly since then. The Pixel 5 continues this successful trend of doing more with less, and takes some truly amazing pictures. Its focus on black magic level image processing has led it to be lauded above many much more expensive phones and while it is still an extremely great camera, this year the sensor has really started to show its age.</p>\n<p>Google definitely has its reasons, it couldn’t find another sensor to work very well with its processing algorithms, there is no avoiding the fact that newer more modern sensors are frankly much better. The 12MP IMX363 which first appeared on the Pixel 3, and is not far removed from the one on the Pixel 2, is now a long way behind larger higher quality sensors. While Google bridged the gaps with software in days past, the competition now takes as good, if not better shots.</p>\n<p>With that said, the Camera is a delight to use — capturing images quickly and easily and achieving photos to be proud of in almost any situation. It punches well above it weight at only £599, and the edition of an ultra-wide lens makes it much more versatile.</p>\n<p>The Pixel 5, as with those that have gone before it, excels in low light, and makes a mean portrait, but most of this is post-processing, so what you see in the preview window might not actually what the image turns out as. It also could be different again when you look at the photo on Google Photos later. Frankly that is usually a great thing, if a little baffling at first, and Google makes it easier to edit or revert changes made. Introducing a process of being able to change the angle of the light in portrait shots. Something that I feel only Google would do, and is amazing to play with, but ultimately, one of those features no-one uses.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Software</h2>\n<p>Which brings us to a larger discussion about Google and Pixel version of Android. It’s a version that crops up nowhere else. A few that get close, but no-one does it as well. The Pixel always stays true to a Google vision of their OS, pushing features to it first, or sometimes exclusively to the Pixel Line.</p>\n<p>This is one huge reason why the Pixel doesn’t need the top of the range processor because Android on the Pixel is nearly always fast and smooth. You get updates first, with Android 11 on board a long time before some are every shipping Android 10 to handsets. Google have also promised this for three years from release, so users will always be up to date — but what happens when Android isn’t optimised for this processor is anyone’s guess.</p>\n<p>There are loads of software delights that you sometimes stubble on such as the power menu now highlighting compatible smart home gadgets and Google Pay cards. Unfortunately, my version does not feature the Google Assistant On Hold feature as it is US only, but does have <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9158064?hl=en-GB\">live transcribe</a> for any audio just a tap away at any point.</p>\n<p>Google want Android to be as useful as possible while collecting data it can use to sell you things and companies adverts. We are all well are of that, and Android on the Pixel is the best possible version of that. You forgive the little quirks and the pestering for maps reviews because the OS is straightforward and a delight to use. Surfacing information, sending you notifications when you need them and being all around a great experience. There is nothing getting in the way on a Pixel, no third-party layers of options, not OEM themes. Just you and Google, and I like that.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"in-hand-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c372c782e2.jpg\" alt=\"In hand 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It’s easy to sum up a Pixel device. Good software, great camera and some compromises somewhere — but with the Pixel 5 they have found their hardware mojo. By actually stepping back and building a device for the current circumstances, they have made ultimately a better phone. No gimmicks, nothing new to learn, just tried and tested hardware all wrapped up in hardware that delivers.</p>\n<p>I feel like my review is about a thousand words too short, but because we know what we are getting with Googles best the words have already been written. The Pixel 5 does open up a more interesting topic around the demand for keeping up to a specification race no-one needs, but when you pick up the device and use it all of that falls away.</p>\n<p>You can point at this spec and that spec, but when you combine these things together in a Google package the Pixel 5 punches well above its weight. Although the camera shows its age, it’s still a delight to use and its software smarts sorts out shooting errors anyway. This is easily the best Pixel ever — and I wouldn’t recommend you buy anything else unless the few ‘cuts’ are things you simply can’t do without.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br /><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8335452151565777\" data-ad-slot=\"6575033860\"></ins><br /><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "iPhone 12 Pro Thoughts",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>After using as many phones as I have over the last 12 months you begin to see things a little differently to just swopping your sim out once a year. While it’s easy to get complacent and just move to the next phone, I simply can’t do that and have to give each phone at least a couple of weeks try whatever my initial feelings are. Some I love and then fall away from quickly like the Galaxy Fold 2, some I love all the way through like the Note 20 Ultra, and some leave me perplexed from the very start.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately my beloved iPhone does that to me this year, so I feel compelled to share some initial thoughts on the iPhone 12 Pro — but this is far from a review.</p>\n<h2>Design</h2>\n<p>There are no words I can say to sum up this design change that do anything other that tell you how much I hate it! I love the look of the square sides and am all for bringing the design in line with the iPad Pro because that also looks great. However, there is a reason every other thing you hold is as curved as possible, your hand doesn’t like it any other way.</p>\n<p>I love the iPhone 5 design, its boxes neatness is one I still keep around in the form of an SE, and sometimes just look at it and appreciate it. Times have changed though, phones no longer feature 4-inch displays and weigh 113g. They contain 6.1” screens and are built of premium materials weighing 182g and frankly it hurts a little.</p>\n<p>Granted it is early days, and things sometimes take a little getting used to but I really don’t like it at all. The boxy design looks great but functions terribly to a point where I don’t think I want to use it any longer. I can’t get behind a design that makes the phone feel much thinker than the iPhone 11 Pro, when in fact it isn’t!</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Rutland270920-5.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a460512c1f.jpg\" alt=\"Rutland270920 5\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Usability</h2>\n<p>Outside of this the iPhone 12 Pro retains everything else that is great about an iPhone. Featuring the same matt back that the iPhone 11 had, meaning that going caseless doesn’t mean you need a polishing rag with you at all times — at least not for the back. The Pacific Blue version I have has a polished band around the sides that is one of the hardest things to keep clean I have ever come across! The white iPhones have struggled with this issue much longer, but unfortunately, there is more surface area on the sides now, or they are easier to see, whatever the reason it’s a fingerprint magnet.</p>\n<p>Battery life seems to be OK, sitting here on Wi-Fi 90% of the time, but is noticeably worse in current usage. It’s never going to run out on me given my more limited usage, but I am using it much more in this ‘getting to know you’ phase of my testing. Those venturing out and even more so when using 5G <em>may</em> have an issue on their hands, but we will see how this goes. I have noticed it getting hot a few times, so this may just be things settling down and syncing from the cloud still. I can’t see an issue with 6+hours of screen on time though.</p>\n<h2>Camera</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately due to being isolated, I haven’t had much chance to really try the camera out other than wandering around my house and snapping a few shots. In good light it is great, as was the iPhone 11 Pro, so this comes as little surprise. Images retain loads of detail, great dynamic range and the new HDR processing is a big leap forward.</p>\n<p>In terms of the camera as a whole, this isn’t a huge improvement, but you are hardly going to get this given that last years iPhone 11 Pro is easily the best smartphone camera on the market. Others do well, with the Note 20 a delight to use, but the iPhone just gets it right so often with little work. The biggest improvement is in the fine detail captured, deep fusion works on all cameras this year and you can <em>really</em> see this at work.</p>\n<p>The post-processing at work on the iPhone 12 Pro seems to take it easier than ever before. I don’t see nearly as much grain from iOS trying to lighten things up too much, and it keeps shadows much darker. I much prefer the look of the more natural colours in iOS photos, and I am glad to say nothing changes in this years phone — no weird skin smoothing either.</p>\n<p>It is impossible for me to say for sure at this stage, but portrait shots seem much easier to shoot than ever before, no doubt helped by the LIDAR sensor. Night mode portraits are great unless there is too much backlight, but only work with the wide sense and not the usual 2x.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I am conflicted. I have bought the new iPhone every year since the iPhone 6 and used them all the way through. Not because better phones don’t exist, but because iPhone suits me much better than anything else. I am not a ‘power user’ which is a euphemism for use your phone far too much, so I do not need top of the line everything. For the last few months I have been using an iPhone SE as my ‘home’ phone and it is one of the best phones I have ever bought.</p>\n<p>Undoubtably the iPhone 12 Pro is much better than anything else available, but I just don’t enjoy using it. The camera is indeed great, but it was great last year too. I am so disappointed by the feel of the phone in my hand that I am considering returning it pretty much straight away. The only thing stopping me is my desire to give the phone real usage, and my thoughts may change…perhaps.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

I think about the unique things that make this phone worth while, and the things I need answering in order to buy one. When it comes to the Galaxy Note line of handsets it is becoming harder and harder to differentiate them past a stylus – but there’s actually a lot to look at in my Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra review.</p>\n<p>I realise that I am doing these two phones in the wrong order. Before the <a href=\"https://gr36.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-5g-review/\">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a> came the Note 20 Ultra. But given how different the Fold is to use, arguably the better device sat in the side lines and waited its turn. I always give these phone a good use, I’m not one of these people the spends a day with a second sim in a phone and moves on, I’ve been using the Note 20 Ultra as my only phone for a few weeks now and I have to say I’m impressed.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-note20/buy/?cid=UK_PPC_3998554642_FF~Eval:Brand%2BProd_Note20_KS~BAP_BS~IM_PR~SMART_SB~NOTE20_OB~TRAFFIC_PK~QualityVisits_FS~LHQ_MD~W_AI~N_MT~EXA_CA~KEW_paid-cdm&gclid=Cj0KCQjw5eX7BRDQARIsAMhYLP8VVxJm9UE_MLiih9quGSRkp59_M4HmG9tKBgtP-k9yUY3W-tz2Ra8aArldEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds\">Note 20 line up</a>, although confusing, is one of the most interesting advances in this line for quite a while. This line topping Ultra model packs all the top of the line specs you’d expect and also expands on new technology first seen in the Galaxy S20 Ultra. This phone has been taken to a point where it is almost perfect on paper in every way, and although paper doesn’t always tell the tale of a smartphone, the premium nature of the Note 20 Ultra is apparent straight away.</p>\n<p>Topping the scales at a mere 208 grams, it is surprisingly light for a device sporting a 6.9inch screen. Although it doesn’t feel <em>light</em> in any way, it is only 50g heavier than an iPhone SE that is a small portion of the size. Every inch of the phone feels premium and well made, with the matte backed Mystic Bronze version I have only adding to the appeal of such a premium smartphone experience. Its boxy, thin, glass and metal design carries on the same signature features as the phones before it but takes a step up in quality and finish.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/959ac341d7.jpg\" alt=\"Note 20 Ultra\" title=\"Note-20-Ultra.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" /></p>\n<h2>Camera</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately we can’t go much further into talking about handling the phone without talking about that huge camera bump. It is ridiculous whichever way you look at it, a design choice that should be inexcusable. Not being afraid of the camera bump is one thing, but not designing it into the back of your phone is another. It makes the device slightly top heavy when holding, wobble when on a table, and also affects some stand up wireless chargers – so be fair warned the design choice does affect more than it looking a bit ugly.</p>\n<p>With all that said I would live with the monstrous bump to get the camera it has inside it. The three camera set up is a delight to use, and gets some amazing results. I have never been the biggest fan of Samsung cameras, but this time I am blown away by the improvements. It might be the new 108mp main camera, it could be the assisted laser focus that removes much of the focus hunting plaguing the S20 Ultra. Or it could be Samsung’s improved processing of images. All of these things combine to make a camera that for once is a genuine competitor to iPhone shooters.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3f266e2fbf.jpg\" alt=\"Rutland270920 2 1\" title=\"Rutland270920-2-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" /></p>\n<p>Not because phones before it got bad results, but because you no longer have to work for it. I have very little need to go into pro mode unless I want a specific look from my images, I can confidently point and shoot and get great results almost all of the time. Unless you play about with the setting the main camera takes snaps with the 108mp camera and then uses “nona-binning, pixel binning by a factor of nine” meaning your images retain loads of detail but don’t take up a huge amount of room on you phone. Making them much easier to share with people and social media.</p>\n<p>You <em>can</em> opt to take images at the full resolution with a few taps, but there are very few reasons to do so. The main sensor is flanked by two 12mp sensors, one f2.2 ultra wide and one f3.0 telephoto. Each one giving the excellent results we expect from Samsung cameras, I particularly enjoy shooting with the ultra wide due to its 120 degree field of view.</p>\n<p>Sure there are some instances in low light that grain creeps in, and sometimes it has a tendency to over expose, but 99/100 you are going to get a shot you are happy with. One word of warning though, the zoom can be a little fiddly and sometimes takes a few moments to realise which lens it should be using. In fact in anything other than good light, a zoomed photo will be using a cropped in version taken on the main camera lens and not the telephoto at all – but you will get great results regardless.</p>\n<p>With regards the the 50x zoom, it’s usable but wont come in handy very often, whereas the 10x and even in some situations the 20x still gives out nice results and keeps plenty of detail in the shot.</p>\n<p></p>\n  <object></object><br />\n  <object></object><br />\n  <object></object><br />\n  <object></object><br />\n  <object></object><br />\n  <object></object><br />\n  <object></object><br />\n  <object></object><br />\n  <object></object><br />\n  <object></object><br />\n  <object></object><br />\n  <object></object><br />\n  <object></object><br />\n  <object></object>\n</div>\n<h2>Screen</h2>\n<p>As with every large screened phone, the in-camera experience allows for many more controls to be packed onto the screen, and still leave a large view finder. The 6.9″ edge Quad HD+ Dynamic screen is capable of 3088×1440 (496ppi) and 120hz refresh rate — but not at the same time.</p>\n<p>This is frustrating to say the least, however I opted for the higher refresh rate of the two choices and suffer no ill effects. The screen is still pin sharp at FHD, vibrant and colour rich to make images and text really stand out.</p>\n<p>Can we spare a moment to talk about these curved screens that Samsung keep insisting on producing. I am not sure they have ever been a good idea, and although the software does an ok job of rejecting unintended touches, it makes the phone much harder to grip onto. I simply <em>have</em> to use a case when using the Note 20 Ultra outside for fear of dropping it. Leading it to invariably shatter into a million pieces given its almost entirely glass construction.</p>\n<p>The factory applied screen protector is frankly garbage. It has already started to gather dust around the top of my screen, and retains prints like it’s trying to collect them all. It should be one of the first things you replace if you don’t want to be polishing your phone all the time. Thankfully the Mystic Bronze version at least fends them off on the back, but if you opt for Mystic Black version it can get very annoying very quickly.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1f87da38c4.jpg\" alt=\"Rutland270920 4 1\" title=\"Rutland270920-4-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" /><br />\nIt is finished in Corning’s latest Gorilla Glass Victus, so should stand up to most things, but remove the screen protector at your own risk.</p>\n<h2>Finger Print Sensor</h2>\n<p>A criticism of the finger print sensors speed and accuracy posed by most reviews thankfully has been unproven in most cases. Although after a couple of weeks of use it is for some reason much slower, requiring me to record my prints again to improve results. The under screen sensor is a little strange to get used to, I am never quite sure where to place my finger on the screen, and I would much prefer one on the back with a tactile place to highlight where to put it. With that said it is light years easier than putting in on the side of the phone, and I combine this <em>with</em> face unlock to mean that the device is usually unlocked before I realise it.</p>\n<p>Thankfully the Note 20 Ultra doesn’t blow past the lock screen once authenticated like phones of old, making interacting with the device much easier and very rarely needing to see the home screen if receiving a notification.</p>\n<h2>Battery Life</h2>\n<p>This is not something I usually have to call out specifically in a modern phone review. Usually a few passing remarks are enough to pitch this in the realms of all day battery life. However this version of the Note 20 I have, the UK Exynos version, is frankly rubbish.</p>\n<p>In the first few days of usage I struggled to get 4 hours screen on time. Opting to leave everything as is out of the box and opting for 120hz refresh rate, and reaching for the charger a long time before I should be doing. When really digging into the setting and putting apps to sleep when you don’t need them etc 4 hours is achievable, but I frankly refuse to have to start turning off location, Bluetooth etc just to get good battery life.</p>\n<p>Samsungs insistence to use their own processors in phones is inhibiting the experience for users, and when the Snapdragon version can see more than 90minute more SOT than this version it is frankly unacceptable. The experience of your device shouldn’t be limited by where you live, and I hope this is addressed very quickly. Galaxy Notes are usually known for their battery life, but this falls well short of the mark currently — bordering on completely unacceptable.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5c7c9485c0.jpg\" alt=\"Note 20 Ultra 3 1\" title=\"Note-20-Ultra-3-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" /></p>\n<p>I have watched countless hours of videos claiming to have a set up that will improve my battery life, I have contacted Samsung who refuse to admit there is an issue. The fact remains the battery life is shockingly bad given the 4500 mAh capacity. Supporting fast charging of 25w and wireless of 15w is no replacement for battery life optimisations done in production.</p>\n<h2>Software</h2>\n<p>I can almost copy and paste my experience with Samsung from any other phone I have used from them in the last couple of years. The Note 20 Ultra features Android 10 and has Samsungs One UI 2.5 on top of this to add in additional features. I might be looked at a bit funny for saying this, but I really like ONEUI now it has matured a little. Of all the skins Samsung have done the best job in redefining what Android feels like, but also retain its charm and underlying features.</p>\n<p>The tie with Microsoft again runs very deep with OneUI, and features almost every Google service matched, by not only a Samsung version, but also now a Microsoft version. A promised update later in the year with further attempt to solidify that partnership with task and note syncing between the two companies. Something that those tied into Office 365 will look at very seriously.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, for Samsung, some things still fall short and get frustrating in parts. The Software is still bloated with advert and notifications to use new features. You’re never quite sure if to update the app in Samsung Store or Google Play, and weirdness continues throughout the OS. The most frustrating of all is syncing a Microsoft 365 calendar to the stock Samsung app just gets you stuck in an endless loop. You must install the Samsung email to enable sync, yet are encouraged to use Outlook.</p>\n<p><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8335452151565777\" data-ad-slot=\"6575033860\"></ins></p>\n<p>I am almost at the stage where I wish Samsung would just ditch Android and produce their own OS. They are stuck in this three-way pull between themselves, Google and Microsoft, leaving the end user slightly confused at what to use. Yet outside of this almost expected weirdness the OS is light, fast, and a pleasure to use.</p>\n<h3>Muti-tasking</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest improvements made to the new devices is the ability to multitask more easily. Much like the Galaxy Fold 2, you can create app pairing stored in the side bar for easy opening of your most used pairings. Although only limited to top and bottom split, using the phone in landscape does allow for quite a lot of information to be displayed thanks to that big screen, so comes in more useful than you might think.</p>\n<p>Of course option exist for floating windows, pinned notes on the screen and all manor of options to get things done. What this really shows is the sheer ability of both the OS and the underlying hardware to multitask with minimal effort. You can have 2 or 3 pretty intensive apps open at a time and never see the Note 20 Ultra miss a beat.</p>\n<p>I would love to see drag and drop implemented into more apps, and Samsung work more closely with the Office team to allow for dragging over documents into email for example. I get the feeling this may be coming in future version, as Microsoft are already onboard with integrating services and also allowing for S Pen usage in more apps.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/68a03b18e6.jpg\" alt=\"Rutland270920 1 1\" title=\"Rutland270920-1-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" /></p>\n<h2>S Pen</h2>\n<p>It could be said that this is one of the major selling points of owning a Note series phone. When in practice I am never sure how many people use it sparingly and only for very few functions. Most long term users talk about never taking it out after the first month, so usefulness is clearly subjective.</p>\n<p>How many people are writing notes on their screen, colouring in or annotating Pdf document remains to be seen. I do do all of those things, but my most used interaction with the S Pen is to allow another interaction element to exist.</p>\n<p>Not only does the S Pen allow for much more accurate interaction with apps — Samsung have reduced latency from 45ms down to 9ms — it also allows for different options when in use. I can scrub through video with my finger but trim the start and end points with the S Pen. I can draw on an image while selecting elements with my finger, and any number of app interactions. I am already well onboard with a <a href=\"https://gr36.com/spen-stylus-interaction/\">stylus as a separate interaction element</a>, but the Note 20 proves to me that Samsung got this dead right by sticking with the included S Pen.</p>\n<p>The real beauty is, if you don’t want to use it, you never have to pop it out of the bottom of the device ever again. I mean who actually uses it to take photos or wave it around like some kind of magic spell to go backwards on a web page.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br />\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8335452151565777\" data-ad-slot=\"6575033860\"></ins><br />\n<!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I have used every version of the note line to date, bar the exploding one and the weird one that never launched in the UK. Some are great, some mediocre. The Note 20 Ultra hits every mark you want it to, bar battery life, it is a premium smartphone that feels like it’s worth very penny of the £1200 you pay for it. Those that use it will feel like they are using the best phone on the market, it seemingly does everything, has a huge gorgeous screen and packs a top of the line camera.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to find downsides to the Galaxy Note Ultra — but then I shouldn’t be able to for this price. No words seem to quite get anywhere to summing it up other than, it’s great. When all phones are now the size of the Note line it’s hard to find a major differentiator other than an S Pen. If Samsung phones are your thing, you are getting a more refined version of the S20 in the Note 20 — one you wont be disappointed with.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

Whilst it sounds all mysterious with the marketing panache of Apple’s colours — what people really want to know is if it is pink, and if so how pink is it really.</p><p>This is a difficult question to answer. Not because there isn’t enough of them about, there are loads of hands on videos and review of both the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and also the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RC1ICxIsr7Y\">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a> — with Samsung providing Mystic Bronze to every reviewer. More so because there is a lot to take into account when deciding on a colour as complex as this one.</p><p>Much like the new Midnight Green colour that the<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone-11-pro/\"> iPhone 11 Pro</a> comes in, Mystic Bronze looks different in different lights. Its matte texture adds to the colour shift and in many instances it appears very bronze coloured. Looking straight on at the phone you would be hard pushed to call the colour anything other than a muted bronze. However when you look at the phone in your hand, the camera bump, rings around the camera sensors and also the top and bottom edges have a much more Pink hue to them.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/8ea258dd0d.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Note 20 Ultra 2 2\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Note-20-Ultra-2-2.jpg\" /></figure><p>It is only when you place the phone next to contrasting colours such as dark jeans or a dark desk, that you really see the pink hue come to life. In comparison to something that is actually <em>is</em> bronze coloured there is really no comparison to the colour. While this defiantly isn’t rose gold, its not bronze either.</p><h2 id=\"adding-a-case\">Adding A Case</h2><p>You’d think that this could be mediated by putting a case on your phone, and while that is a great idea in principle it actually adds to the Pink colour. By isolating the Camera unit the phone takes on more of a pink vibe and may make some people even more unhappy. So bare this in mind if you are thinking about getting this colour.<br /></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/b484fe2132.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Note 20 Ultra 1 1\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Note-20-Ultra-1-1.jpg\" /></figure><p>Personally I think this colour is great and those that go for it will be very happy with its overall finish and it’s resistance to finger prints. However bear in mind that this phone defiantly is pinkish.</p>\n",

				"title": "Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G Review",
				"content_html": "<p>About 10 months ago, I was invited down by Samsung KX to have a few hours hands on with their first folding phone. Mere months after it had been recalled due to major issues with the device, it was back with a bang, and already picking up quite a following. The appeal of having a tablet folded up in your pocket had a much larger pull than the £1500 price tag, as was <a href=\"https://gr36.com/advance-tech-exciting/\">the exciting move forward in technology</a> that Samsung had been teasing for years.</p>\n<p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1mVtJ4oVhQ&feature=emb_title\">really liking the phone</a>, it wasn’t ready for me to splash my own cash on it, there were far too many compromises with handset for me to bear. Fast-forward to now as the second version goes on sale, with many of the first versions issues fixed — but with a hefty price increase. Has Samsung done enough to justify the £1800 ($2000) price tag?</p>\n<h2>Premium Feel</h2>\n<p>There are lots of people that get annoyed when you talk about the price of the Galaxy Z Fold 2 in reviews. They think that this shouldn’t be brought into it as there is nothing that lives up to the Folds usability. While this true, it is impossible to escape the £1800 price tag and the expectations it brings with it. You expect a premium smartphone with top of the line specs — and that is exactly what you get from the handset. In the hand it feels nothing short of magical, the weight (282g) is impossible to describe as anything else but heavy, but in the hand it is balanced perfectly.</p>\n<p>Especially folded, the unit sinks into your hand with a reassuring heft. Samsung have done some great engineering to get all the technology in this size package, but you feel the weight every time you use it. There are no creaks or cracks from this Uber Smartphone, so the engineering needs some special appreciation when compared to others on the market.</p>\n<p>Samsung have developed the hinge much further forward when compared to last years unit, and taken over much of the function from <a href=\"https://gr36.com/48-hours-galaxy-z-flip/\">the Z Flip</a>. Four CAM hinges allow the phone to be oped to whichever angle you wish, and provides more resistance to opening to allow more usability. Combined with a sweeper system to remove dust from the hinge should mean that this unit resists the issues plaguing the first attempt, and certainly those still using the Z Flip support this claim.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2024/86727f19a4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" /></p>\n<p>This re-engineered hinge further adds to the premium feel for the Galaxy Z Fold 2, where every part of the hardware feels thought through and designed to exude a certain type of extravagant image. As <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fQ3ReOb85ac?t=589\">Flossy Carter says</a>, you are going to see lots of images of these on tables surrounded by glasses of Cristal. There is a certain exuberance to the Galaxy Fold 2, and lots of flexing going on simply because it delivers on it premium price tag.</p>\n<h2>Screens</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the number one complaint against the first version of the Galaxy Fold was the tiny cover screen. While perfectly useful for notification triaging, on a device so futuristic it felt out of place. So, understandably this is the first thing that is immediately obvious when using the Fold 2. The cover screen now fills almost the entirety of the front of the phone minus a small hole punch camera cut out.</p>\n<p>At 6.2” (2260×816 – 386ppi – 60hz ) the cover screen is now more usable, and even if a bit narrow to type on, is perfect for quick tasks or responding to notifications. Enabling swiping on the keyboard makes interacting with the keyboard at bit easier, but this is not to say it is impossible. The tall, narrow screen is perfectly suited to scrolling through emails or social media. Using the cover screen grows on you more than the last version ever did, and I found myself interacting with it much more than I thought I would.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Z-Fold-2-Review-06-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d7fab7f4ad.jpg\" alt=\"Z Fold 2 Review 06 1\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>However, why have a huge screen and not use it, open up the fold and the beauty of the screen is a wonder to behold. Samsung have done away with the huge notch from the first version as well as boosting the size and refresh rate (2208×1768 – 373ppi – 120hz). Dubbed the ‘Infinity Flex’ display, it goes closer to the edge now, encompassing the whole of the device, bar Samsungs signature hold punch.</p>\n<p>Apps in use on the cover screen carry over to the inside screen (bar a little bit of weirdness from some), to give you something truly immersive. When using the inner screen it feels like you are moving pixels around the screen. The adaptive display varies refresh rate from 11zh all the way up to 120hz, meaning that no matter that you are doing you will get great battery life and also a smooth scrolling experience. The Jelly scroll that the original fold suffered from is not completely removed but almost impossible to spot.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to find a downside to this gorgeous display, games look great, reading is brilliant and videos immersive. When open the device feels balanced and perfectly poised in your hand for media consumption, and many users will see little reason to use anything else for all of their needs. The inner display is truly why you would buy the Galaxy fold, and this version truly delivers.</p>\n<p>Of course there is one, the screen has a crease in the middle that is hard to avoid. Much like any other foldable, you can feel it in usage, you can see it in some instances but not every one. The great thing is that it does not take away anything when you are using the device, it doesn’t stick out and in fact soon fades into the background like a notched screen, or the camera hole punch.</p>\n<h2>Usability</h2>\n<p>So, you want to actually use the thing right? Well all of that reassuring weight we have spoken about, it’s also going to affect it in your pocket and in your hand. There is no getting away from this phone/tablet hybrid being heavy. I found myself struggling to hold it up when open, and resorted to using both hands most of the time — but that’s the point right.</p>\n<p>In this heavy package you get two screens, and battery life that will get you loads of screen onetime if you use the larger screen most of the time — and considerably more if you use the outer screen more. Even in the first week of me using the Fold 2 and playing with it what felt like constantly, I would still be at more than 25% when going to bed. You should comfortably be able to get 6hours of screen on time and still have battery left over, which is amazing results considering battery life should also get better as the OS analyses my usage and improves things. If the next model slims things down, I would hope that battery life stays as good as it is because an increase in weight is worth it.</p>\n<p>You can’t expect a Galaxy fold to be as light as a regular phone can you, this is simply the trade off with wanting and using one of these devices. While something like the Z flip balances the reassuring weight without feeling clumsy, the Z Fold feels a little unwieldy when out and about. Bending the phone slightly helps to fit it better in your hand, but obviously adds a little distortion to the screen.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Z-Fold-2-Review-08-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ce633d6733.jpg\" alt=\"Z Fold 2 Review 08 1\" /></p>\n<h3>Flex Mode</h3>\n<p>Expanding on the special mode introduced with the Z Flip, the Z Fold 2 allows apps to take advantage of a partially folded state. As an example Youtube in Flex mode shows a video on the top half of the screen, allowing you to interact with the comments on the bottom half. Google Duo also supports this as does the native camera app.</p>\n<p>The limited nature of this and the lack of visual clues means you may spend a bit of time experimenting to find out what does and doesn’t support it — and often this is more no than yes. I am yet to find any reason to use it outside of novelty, especially given the lack of people actually using Google Duo. I wouldn’t go out of my way to encourage others to use it, just so I can flex my phone.</p>\n<p>More often that not, a partial flexed form is used simply to enable me to set my phone down and still watch a video, or prop it up to keep an eye on the time. As app developers update apps we <em>might</em> see some more innovative use of flex mode, but given the lack of support so far I wouldn’t hold my breath.</p>\n<h3>Tablet Mode</h3>\n<p>Which leads me into another issue with app support, and the lack of tablet layout from apps. It could be the weird aspect ratio, it could be Android apps as a whole, but many apps make little use of the bigger screen.</p>\n<p>Apps like Outlook are a delight to use, and offer different layouts and view options, but most just put more content on the screen with no options to increase text size or improve readability. Samsung does offers options in settings to choose between blowing the app up or trying to force more content. Combined with further options in Samsungs own <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock-2020\">Goodlock app</a>, you can tune most things to work, but it takes a considerable amount of work.</p>\n<h3>Muti-Tasking Master</h3>\n<p>All these words can be ignored if you want the biggest screen possible on a smartphone to do your ‘stuff’. If you need a device to work on the go, consume loads of media, or just want to blow everything up as large as possible you’ll put up with all the downsides.</p>\n<p>Samsung have put in a great deal of work to make the Fold 2 take advantage of the large inner screen and make it as useful as possible. It is a delight to use two apps side by side when multi taking. Having email and calendar up on the screen while talking on the phone, or simply watching YouTube while texting is quite frankly a transformative experience. Sure you can do that on a tablet, but you can’t then fold it up and put it in your pocket. If being productive on the go is your bag, then this needs to be your phone.</p>\n<p>I am on the fence about how usable Flex mode is, but the amazing app pairing done by OneUI is something that you may struggle to live without. Other phones such as the Note20 Ultra do this as well, but nowhere near on the same level.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Z-Fold-2-Review-05-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5e6851d313.jpg\" alt=\"Z Fold 2 Review 05 1\" /></p>\n<h3>Software</h3>\n<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 2 runs on Android 10 and has Samsungs One UI 2.5 on top of this to add in additional features. It comes bundled with the expected Google services but also several Microsoft ones baked in, such as syncing your photos to OneDrive. There is very little to say about Android nowadays, as it functions exactly as expected and is intuitive to use. The tie with Microsoft is due to get stronger with improvements to note and reminders syncing with MS products as they take aim at productivity customers.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, for Samsung, they seem to never really get services 100% correct. Photo sync only works with a Microsoft account, not a Microsoft 365 account which is frankly bizarre. A Microsoft 365 calendar does not sync to the stock calendar unless you instal the Samsung email app, yet you are encouraged to use Outlook.</p>\n<p>Samsung does provide, in my opinion, the best extension or ‘skin’ on Android around today. Samsung’s design and user experience are often a delight to use. They have really thought about a modern design that doesn’t deviate too far from stock Android design, but offers something uniquely Samsung. Of course that is a subject view point, but since OneUI was introduced the design and implementation of their software has improved dramatically.</p>\n<p>I just wish Samsung didn’t feel the need to fill their apps full of adverts, or useless information at every turn. Even the default weather app has news articles and rubbish crammed in it for no good reason. I know it takes very little to change these apps to others, I just don’t expect to see these kinds of things in default apps on an £1800 phone. Some users have already reported adverts and the usual shady tactics by Samsung, something that needs to be fixed if they want to be taken seriously.</p>\n<h3>Changes to your life</h3>\n<p>When you adopt the Fold 2 it changes the way you use your phone. Both in a positive and a negative way. The large screen allows you to do things that you simply can’t any other phone, it provides something that only the Z Fold can provide. It is in essence a folding tablet, and there are adjustments you will have to make to the way you use it.</p>\n<p>Taking out the Fold 2 and walking around gives you a level of anxiety that nothing else has given me. The slippery body and high price tag make me nervous every time my phone makes a noise. There are already reports of some dropages, and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/iuwzkj/welp/\">it seems to hold up pretty well</a>, but the lack of cases and expected large repair bills leave me worried, and I am not the only one. Due to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/16/21139897/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-ultra-thin-glass-durability-scratch-test-jerryrigeverything\">longevity worries on the UTG screen</a> and no IP rating, users are worried <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/iw71es/im_scared_to_clean_the_inner_screen_protector/\">even about cleaning the device correctly</a>.</p>\n<p>The inner screen still has a tendency to scratch easily, and you’ll need to take some extra care. You won’t be using this at the beach, or throwing it into the bottom of a bag, but if <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-Gt4GpEgyU\">long-time users of other foldable phones</a> are anything to go by it should hold up ok. It is just another thing you need to think about when choosing a device like this.</p>\n<p>I have to treat this phone with an extra amount of care, and in some instances change the way I use it. Which is what a foldable device dictates, you are carrying around a huge screen in your pocket and as such you’ll be opening it as much as possible to really take advantage. The screen draws you in and makes many tasks much easier, such as typing out a long email on the split keyboard.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Camera</h2>\n<p>If there is anything I can point the finger at that is simply not good enough it is the camera. There is nothing inherently wrong with the shooter, but at this super flagship price point it is simply not good enough.</p>\n<p>You <em>can</em> get some good shots from it, but be prepared to work for them and chuck 30–40% of them in the bin. In good light you are going to be happy with almost everything you take, despite not holding the most amount of detail they could, shots are bright and as with all Samsung images retain a vibrant saturation. In any other situation they are grainy, washed out and suffer from some kind of strange skin smoothing effort despite the option being switched off.</p>\n<p>When trying to discus this with others that have the phone you are told to use Pro mode and do this and that, or simply blamed for the results. While it great that these options exist for you to have control over the image you take, I don’t feel you should <em>have</em> to do this is take a good shot. Undoubtedly the Galaxy Z Fold 2 gets the job done but when great cameras like the iPhone 11, Pixel 4 and OnePlus 8 take images with zero input, this camera falls well short of what I expect.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Z-Fold-2-Review-09-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1a2f67389b.jpg\" alt=\"Z Fold 2 Review 09 1\" /></p>\n<p>There are other things you get with this phones camera that no one else provides. The huge screen is the best view finder possible, even if it does feel like you’re one of those people that takes pictures with a tablet. As well as the software ‘flex mode’ allowing you to set the phone down half flexed to stabilise your image, or simply view images you have snapped in the bottom half. Bear in mind though you have to place the phone down on its screen to do this.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>While I would stop short of recommending this phone to others because of cost and the ways in which you need to change the way you use your phone, for a certain type of user this is going to be invaluable. It provides something to no other device on the market can provide, not just in the way it works, but the way it makes you feel. You feel as though you are using a little slice of the future and getting something out of your phone that no-one else does.</p>\n<p>I can somewhat forgive the camera because I am getting a folding device that immerses me into whatever I want to do. You can play games, multi-task and consume media on this like no other device can and that speaks volumes. I love the Galaxy Z Fold 2 because it has that little something about it, it’s not the best at everything but it provides something unique and does it brilliantly.</p>\n<p>If you really want a folding tablet, then look no further than this model. It fixes all the issues from the first one and puts them in a premium package that feels worth very bit of the price you are paying. But let’s be clear, to buy the Galaxy Z Fold 2 you need to really <em>want</em> a folding tablet because you will pay for it. Both in the high price tag and also in the caveats of having such a large device.</p>\n<p>It comes down to do the advantages of having such a large screen to use, out weigh the downsides of carrying it around on your pocket all the time. For me, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 feels like wearing your winter coat all year because it is cold half the time, but for others this is going to be a game changer.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>You will never in your life posses something that is as important as your attention. The notice you take of someone or something is so craved after that throughout history those that have sought it have performed some of the worst and best acts humankind has ever seen. Yet we give it away without a moment of thought towards where it is spent.</p><p>The Accident Greeks wrote the very tale many of the modern condition are named after, Narcissus could be a tale told today about Instagram influencers or Facebook moms groups. Its tale told us the dangers of too much attention, and hinted at how much it is worth, but in modern times the most valuable thing we have is being manipulated, sought by companies, and trickled down onto us like drug crazed zombies.</p><p>Alphabet and Facebook are two of the richest companies in the world. Both companies rely heavily if not solely on the user as their product. Sure Facebook may attempt to sell cameras now, and Google does give you a suite of apps and sell a few phones, but these are drops in the ocean compared to the advertising they sell.</p><p>You are the most important thing to them, you are the thing they lust after, your attention the fuel that grids the gears of their business and you are being manipulated for it. Having your <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00556G7LU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\">attention span shortened and your ability to concentrate eroded</a> simply so companies can make money from you. Using <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2020/09/2018-06-27-deceived-by-design-final/\">dark patterns and un-ethical web design</a> to manipulate our base instinct and change our brains and erode our society.</p><blockquote>Facebook – Takes your data in exchange for being able to brag about yourself and stalk your friends. – <a href=\"https://www.nathanlustig.com/siren-servers-why-are-we-ok-with-giving-away-our-data/\">Nathan Lustig</a></blockquote><p>As Justin Lanier <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/jaron-lanier-tech-oracle-profile\">points out</a> Social media is in some ways “worse than cigarettes, in that cigarettes don’t degrade you. They kill you, but you’re still you.” Social media is changing us for the worst, creating attention seeking, narcissistic ego driven monsters that can’t even see what’s wrong. Like many addicts, heavy users react with aggression and dismissal at the very suggestion of being manipulated and cheated out of their attention.</p><h2 id=\"all-eyes-on-me\">All Eyes On Me</h2><p>Unfortunately, it is no longer the companies themselves that crave the attention you so easily give away. So much effort is placed on gaining your attention that now, users crave it themselves too. On every platform that promotes the sharing of information attention is sought from others. Users are encouraged to share more and more personal details about their daily life for others to see, and companies to use to show you better adverts.</p><p>It is even evident in niche services such as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/iiabox/strava_wankers_rant/g36ouxt/\">Strava</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/zwift-cracking-cheats-hackers-organisation-polices-racing-434487\">Zwift</a>, both platforms designed to benefit athletic training and improve fitness. There is no reason for cheating on platforms like this, other than internet points. Nothing is gained from being at the top, or using a car instead of a bike to map your ride, other than to receive the attention they crave.</p><p>Don’t think this is a young persons game either, in fact, some evidence suggests that this constant craving for attention exists worse in middle-aged individuals. Cases of people <a href=\"https://www.mentalhelp.net/advice/craving-attention/\">seeking help for this kind</a> of conditions has skyrocketed in modern times. Not keeping feelings like this in check can evolve into Histrionic personality disorder (HPD) and affect the lives of individuals. Many doctors believe that HPD is shaped by the psychological factors of an individuals surroundings. Heavy users of social media with reduced personal interaction could be having <a href=\"https://psychcentral.com/disorders/histrionic-personality-disorder/\">their personality shaped</a> by their online environment.</p><p>Although attention seeking is fairly common in childhood, the skills needed to cope with these stressors are formed in early life. As much as a child learns that by creating a scene they have all the eyes on them, an adult learns that attention can off set insecurities, help cope with jealousy focused on others, and any number of feelings they are unable to deal with.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/fc39e84479.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"5184\" height=\"3456\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@gaberce?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Gabe Pierce</a> / <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"it-s-all-harmless-fun\">It’s All Harmless Fun</h2><p>Unfortunately, it is easy to see why. It’s hard to find a downside to all the attention people can gain, but a few posts online fishing for feedback is one thing, but if these feelings can quickly resolved into conditions such as <a href=\"https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/ConditionsAndTreatments/munchausen-syndrome\">Munchausen syndrome</a>. A particularly nasty metal illness that leads to the faking of illness so more attention and focus is gained by the individual. Something that can also be suffered by proxy, and resulted in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley_Allitt\">death of four children, and injury to many more</a> by one person in the 1990’s. So next time you think that attention seeking is harmless, makes sure you realise how important it is.</p><p>This was long before the likes of Facebook and Instagram came along, meaning mental illness could be exacerbated in modern times. As attention is so much easier to attain when you can speak to millions of people in seconds. Munchausen syndrome now features a <a href=\"https://insights.ovid.com/article/00007611-200093070-00006\">‘by internet’</a> variation specifically for those that deceive people with fake illness for attention on the internet. Attention is so easy to gain online if you just know the right buttons to press and the right things to do. But you can’t blame this all on individuals, because of course all the attention sought by users means fantastic business for the companies selling adds.</p><p>More eyeballs on websites means more money in the bank account from people wishing to advertise to you. Platforms are built with these types of things in mind. Attention, chaos and emotions outpouring onto their website leads more eyeballs and more adverts seen. Remember the psychological stress we talked about earlier that can lead to all sorts of mental health issues. Well, Facebook were caught out <a href=\"//www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2014/06/28/facebook-manipulated-user-news-feeds-to-create-emotional-contagion/#7177023e39dc\">manipulating emotional distress</a> in their news feed, just for users attention. Unfortunately for its users, if Zuckerberg needs attention, the users must provide it, and by the bucket load.</p><p>Social media usage doesn’t cause metal health issues, but the constant push for more and more attention can breed the conditions for it to flourish. Sure enough, only an individual can judge if social media is a distraction or not, and giving something your attention is one thing, but being manipulated intentionally to waste more and more time is another. Business models built around attention and time spent on site has shifted much of our society to a new way of life. One where our time and our ability to concentrate are not being stollen, they are being given away freely. Nothing good can come of this.</p>\n",

				"title": "How To Post Films Watched To Micropub",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>I am currently experimenting with moving all of my social things to micro.blog. I know I have tried <a href=\"https://gr36.com/youre-not-cool-enough-for-micro-blog/\">this before</a> (twice) but this time I don’t want it to be my blog I just want a place to hang out and post everything to. This will mainly be an Instagram replacement, posting checkins as most importantly books and films I have watched.</p>\n<p>I can’t quite work out Goodreads yet, but by using <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/\">Letterboxed</a> I can post watched film easily using <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/2017/api-posting/\">Micropub</a>. You can of course use this with micro.blog but also with any service that support Micropub, so also applies to WordPress and other more mainstream services.</p>\n<h2>Choose your way</h2>\n<p>There are two relatively easy ways to do this, one free and one paid, both with pros and cons. They both rely on singing up to Letterboxed, and using your profile RSS feed to post updates. So, whichever you choose, you will need to sign up and then copy your feed address from your profile page. Once logged in, on the menu bar furthest to the right you will notice an RSS icon. Right click and copy this first.</p>\n<h2>IFTTT</h2>\n<p>This method is completely free so is a win straight off the bat, but as a caveat is a little more complex to set up and I found a little limited to work with. This is personal preference, of course, but IFTTT is still very straight forward to set up.</p>\n<p>Click on Create and chose RSS as your IF (the trigger), choose new item in feed and paste in your RSS feed from Letterboxed. The Then (action) part is a Webhook to allow you to post to micropub services. For this example, I am going to run through a micro.blog, but they will all be pretty much the same.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot-2020-07-24-at-09.27.01-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/23cd288f5c.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020 07 24 at 09 27 01 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"551\" border=\"0\" />Make a web request, and then put in the URL of your service, in this case it is <code>https://micro.blog/micropub</code>. Method is POST and content type is usually application/x-form-url-encoded. In the body you need two bits of information, an access code and what you want the post to display. This will be dependent on your device but in my micro.blog case I use the following.</p>\n<p><code>access_token=ABCDEF&amp;content={{EntryContent}}&amp;name={{ItemTitle}}</code></p>\n<p>With the access token generated in my setting of my micro.blog.</p>\n<p>You can customise the body content to whatever you want to display in the post. If you leave this as is, then it will display the raw content of the RSS feed.</p>\n<h2>Zapier</h2>\n<p>This is a much more rounded service that makes it much easier to customise the post content, but at a cost of £20 per month. For this cost, you get the ability to automate many more things, so it <em>might</em> be worth considering but please bear this in mind.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot-2020-07-24-at-09.11.31-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/249f233fa1.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020 07 24 at 09 11 31 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"962\" border=\"0\" />Start by creating a new Zap, the trigger is RSS and the event is a new item in the feed, Past in the Letterboxed RSS feed you have saved and that is all you need to do on this step as you don’t need any information to access this feed. On the next step Zapier will find the data — so make sure you’ve at least recorded one watched film, and then pull everything into Zapier.</p>\n<p>The action is Webhooks, and the action event needs to be POST to tell micropub to post information. By customising the request you can go as deep as you like, this is where Zapier makes it so easy to post images, ratings and everything the feed contains effortlessly and understandably. To do this put the Micropub url into the first box, in my case this is <code>https://micro.blog/micropub</code> and leave the Payload type and Form.</p>\n<p>Click the plus sign under Data, and type <code>content</code> into the first box, and then you can customise the post until your heart is content. Click the plus button again and type <code>access_token</code> into the first box and in the second one copy in an access code from micro.blog. Your service may not require this, but will usually require some kind of authentication.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot-2020-07-24-at-09.12.01-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7a61b825bb.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020 07 24 at 09 12 01 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"919\" border=\"0\" />All the other topics can remain as they are by default, by clicking continue you are given the option to test the post. Do this and check that everything appears correctly — you can always go back and change things before re-testing. This is another option that makes Zapier a great service to work with. Once you’re happy, finish everything off and now every time you review a film it will post to Micropub.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "Cracking the Todoist Code",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>Since sharing my <a href=\"https://gr36.com/todoist-organise-my-life/\">Todoist set up</a> and how I get things done loads of people have given me some ideas and shared their experience. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrChrisJWilson/status/1262601218674786304?s=20\">One of which</a> I wanted to try to help out with, and that is the natural language input. This feels amazingly natural to me, but for some feels like a bit of a code — so let’s crack it together.</p>\n<p>On Mac, you can use <a href=\"https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/115001745265-Task-Quick-Add\">Control+Command+A</a> to open quick add. Or to start your entry, regardless of platform, just tap or click on the Plus icon. Quick Add is the fastest way to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a new task</li>\n<li>Set a due date and time for a task</li>\n<li>Attach a label to a task</li>\n<li>Set the priority level for a task</li>\n<li>Add a task to a project</li>\n<li>Assign a task to a collaborator</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Date And Time</h2>\n<p>If you can’t crack this bit then there might not be much help for you, as it’s that easy. Simply write out when you want to complete the task exactly how you would say it. For example, “tomorrow at 4pm” or “every other Tuesday starting March 3rd”.</p>\n<p><code>Call mum next wednesday at 2pm</code></p>\n<p>This can be as simple or as powerful as you need it to be. Most tasks you add will have a context date e.g. next Friday, or an actual date 2nd March, but some don’t fit into this pattern. Luckily, Todoist understands even complicated expressions and will interrupt what you need pretty much all the time.</p>\n<h2>Repeating Tasks</h2>\n<p>For things that crop up regularly, or just every so often, you will soon get to grips with typing ‘every’ to get these set up. Every is the start of all things repeating and is really helpful for even the most complex things.</p>\n<p><code>Call mum every wednesday</code></p>\n<p>But it doesn’t have to stop there, you can arrange tasks for whenever suits you.</p>\n<p><code>Call mum every other week day</code></p>\n<p><code>Call mum every wedneday june 2nd to july 1st</code></p>\n<p>For those tasks that you want to happen a specific period after you complete it put in an !.</p>\n<p><code>Call mum every! week</code></p>\n<p>This will set up a task to call mum exactly a week after you complete the last item. You can of course use every! Day, month, year — depends on how often you want to do it.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n<h2>Labels</h2>\n<p>Labels help me highlight something that I want to know at specific times. For example, I have a morning tag, and a someday tag, so I don’t need to give these due dates or times, but I can find these tasks easily when required.</p>\n<p>To add a tag just put a @ before the name.</p>\n<p><code>Call mum next wednesday @morning</code></p>\n<p>You can make these as complex or as easy as you like. Some people like to have tags for tasks they need to do while driving, or when they have a spare 5 minutes.</p>\n<p><code>Call mum next wednesday @driving</code></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot-2020-05-20-at-14.12.45-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9f38a405b9.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020 05 20 at 14 12 45 1\" width=\"595\" height=\"91\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Priority</h2>\n<p>I have never adopted priorities in either email flags or my tasks, but it helps hugely if you want to sift through all your tasks and really get down to how important things are. To assign a priority (flag) just type p1, p2 or p3.</p>\n<p><code>Call mum next wednesday p1</code></p>\n<p>So, when your tasks are listed in Today view or Upcoming view they will be sorted by priority so you can get the most important things done first.</p>\n<h2>Projects</h2>\n<p>Projects are the main sorting point for most users set up in Todoist. They can be used in a variety of ways to highlight long-term project or simply having an area to assign task to — such as home and work.</p>\n<p>To move a task to a project you simply put a # before it. You can type all of it out or just the first few letters and then tap on the suggestion.</p>\n<p><code>Call Mum next wednesday #home</code></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Todoist-Quick-Add-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8313fcffd9.jpg\" alt=\"Todoist Quick Add 1\" width=\"2000\" height=\"955\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Collaborator</h2>\n<p>If you need some help, or just want to allocate your task to someone else that you work with, you can do this by typing a + and then their name. Again type it all out, or just the first few letters and then tap their name in the popup suggestion.</p>\n<p><code>Call Mum next wednesday +Jon</code></p>\n<p>This is only possible in shared projects so make sure you have assigned the correct project first. The above example would not work, but the following <em>will</em> if you share a home project with Jon.</p>\n<p><code>Call mum next wednesday #home +Jon</code></p>\n<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br /><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8335452151565777\" data-ad-slot=\"6575033860\"></ins><br /><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n<h2>Linking it all</h2>\n<p>The real power of all these ‘codes’ is that you can link them all together and make powerful but quick entires into your task list. This rapidly becomes second nature and allows you to brain dump effortlessly with minimal sorting afterwards.</p>\n<p>So setting a reminder to call mum at 7pm every 7 days for 8 weeks, adding it to your routines task and attaching a personal tag becomes</p>\n<p><code>call mum every! week until 8th july #routines @personal</code></p>\n<p>You’ll be using <a href=\"https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327\">Todoist</a> as power user in no time and setting it up to remind you of everything you need. Why not <a href=\"https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327\">sign up</a> and give it a shot as I’d love to see your setups or how you use Todoist to help you get things done.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "How I use Todoist To Organise My Life",
				"content_html": "<p>So. No apologies here, but I ripped off this idea directly from Matt Birchler’s write-up <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/how-i-use-things-3-to-organize-my-life/\">on his Things set up</a>. Even though he is a strong believer in the ability of Things, and also everyone <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1261314996048363521\">in the replies</a>seems to think the <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/todoist-my-new-app-to-get-things-done/\">Todoist</a> design is trash, I think very much that we have the same outlook on GTD. The basis of this revolves around “offloading your brain” so you can focus on other things.</p>\n<p>I never set levels of tasks that I <em>HAVE</em> to get done each day, but I <em>DO</em> aim to get 3 main things ticked off each working day. This set up has been how I get everything done daily and also why I forget loads of meaningless stuff. I would love you all to give <a href=\"https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327\">Todoist a try here</a>. This isn’t a GTD set up, but it’s my set up and it all starts with the Inbox.</p>\n<h2 id=\"inbox\">Inbox</h2>\n<p>More or less everything starts life in here. All my tasks from heavy-duty projects to simple reminders start life as a string of text in my inbox. Having tried almost all the major task managers, I am sure most people would agree that Todoist does it best for just dumping everything in and this is the reason why I struggle to take to any other app.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" title=\"Todoist-Setup-Screenshots-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8a6533ba1a.jpg\" alt=\"Todoist Setup Screenshots 1\" /></figure>\n<p>Whenever any tasks arise I use the Mac shortcut or the widget on iOS to quickly add it to my inbox. If the task can be done straight away and within 5 minutes this is the only time it doesn’t get added because I will complete that task straight away. If I know when it needs to be done I can allocate the due date then in natural language and forget about it.</p>\n<p>The power of being able to just type out something like “follow up with Geoff in 2 months #work” and never have to think about it again is the biggest thing that improves my productivity and also my mental health.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moving-and-tagging\">Moving And Tagging</h2>\n<p>I have a recurring task to sort my Inbox at 7:30 every morning which is usually the time I am sitting down at my desk. I tried doing this as my last thing each day but it didn’t stick. My habits dictate I never leave work without having completed everything or moved things to the following day so this became the best way for me to pick anything up that has been missed or cropped up later.</p>\n<p>The next stage of my to-dos life begins when this notification goes off. I then go through all of my tasks, allocating them due dates and times and moving them to projects. As with the Inbox, if I can do this straight away and within 5–10 minutes I will do this task and cross it off. So, not every task lives a long life or makes it any further than my inbox.</p>\n<h2 id=\"projects\">Projects</h2>\n<p>I don’t use Projects as Todoist intend, or indeed how any task manager apps think you will use it. This is simply because I never really have many large scale projects to complete. I have just a few that I use more like areas that my task relates to. These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One-Off tasks – anything that I need to get done and that’s the end of it. Most home things end up here.</li>\n<li>Work – most of my stuff ends up here, small or large tasks to get done. Going forward my team will move to a shared Task managing platform, so we can allocate things, but at the moment this is just me.</li>\n<li>Routines – Anything that is reoccurring such as put the bin out, read my meters, set my Strava goals for the week.</li>\n<li>Creative – any writing tasks or newsletter projects I want to complete. These usually contain a link to the relevant Ulysses Sheet.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" title=\"Todoist-Upcoming-Mac-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d86b4e6789.jpg\" alt=\"Todoist Upcoming Mac 1\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"the-upcoming-screen\">The Upcoming Screen</h2>\n<p>This is where I spend most of my time, with the upcoming screen (previously next 7 days) of the Mac app open. This gives me an overview of the next few days, and allows me to put in times if I need to and arrange my day fully. There is never a time that a task doesn’t have a due date, so this screen gives me everything.</p>\n<p>I am not afraid to push something if other things crop up so from this screen I can just drag a task to another day, but also add tasks for other days effortlessly. Before the upcoming screen I found myself switching between areas depending on what I was doing, so now things are much more streamlined. I have a calendar subscription <a href=\"https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/208789889-Use-Todoist-with-your-calendar\">set up for an overview</a> if I am not sat at my desk, this works really well with the Stock iOS app.</p>\n<h2 id=\"little-tricks\">Little Tricks</h2>\n<p>I have picked up some little things over the few years I have been using Todoist that really help me. These don’t fit into any area but are worth sharing anyway.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Event Tickets – if I am going anywhere I save a PDF of the tickets (either the email or the web conformation) attach this to a reminder that pops up and the event start time. That way I am not searching my emails when I get there.</li>\n<li>Morning Tag – This is a new one stolen from Matt, but is working very well. Instead of trying to guess times, anything that I want to do first thing I allocate a Morning tag to.</li>\n<li>Drag in Emails – If you use Apple Mail on Mac or iPadOS you can <a href=\"https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/206522639-How-can-I-use-Todoist-with-Apple-Mail-\">drag in an email as a Todoist item</a>and it will link straight to it. Mind Blown.</li>\n<li>Browser extension – <a href=\"https://doist.com/blog/hidden-features-todoist/#add_article\">Get this</a> to save any Safari links you need to refer to.</li>\n<li>Due dates based on last completed date – If you want to set a reoccurring reminder for a length of time after that last one use a ! After the every. For example, “task every! week” will create a task one week after you complete the last one.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"improvements\">Improvements</h2>\n<p>There are a few things that I do desire from Things. None of these are critical, I wouldn’t say I miss them, but would help for my specific use case.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create Project – There are times when I create items that then turn into a much larger project. I currently have to copy these into a new project, but in Things the option exists to create one from an item.</li>\n<li>Someday – I long for this to be an option in Todoist. I just like to dump longer term things into here and leave them to plan later. I have tried to do something similar with tags but it just never really stuck.</li>\n<li>Start Dates – oh boy this is a big one. I want to be able to set a start date for some tasks that take a while or are easier done slowly over time such as writing my newsletter. Currently, I have to set a “start newsletter” task and then another “finish newsletter” task. I would love to set it as a current task or ongoing task in Upcoming.</li>\n<li>Calendar Items – Another big one I would love is to see upcoming calendar events in the Upcoming screen, so I can work my tasks around meetings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The End</p>\n<p>There are a ridiculous number of apps and services I have tried, and I still get suckered into new ones all the time. However, Todoist works well for me, and has <a href=\"https://gr36.com/todoist-my-new-app-to-get-things-done/\">done for years</a>. My set up has gone through so many changes that it doesn’t resemble anything like what I started with and will probably change in the future. The great thing is that <a href=\"https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327\">Todoist is available everywhere</a>, and is improving all the time.</p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327\">Todoist</a> and share your set up <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@gr36%20here's%20my%20Todoist%20set%20up\">with me</a>.</p>\n",

				"title": "Wahoo Element Bolt Review",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Wahoo-Element-Bolt-Hero..jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a3ede37870.jpg\" alt=\"Wahoo Element Bolt Hero\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I know exactly what you’re thinking. What exactly is this thing and how can I use this with my iPad? Well, this is something completely different, something I use for my new love cycling, but it’s still a gadget and well worth a review. So here are my thoughts on the Wahoo Element Bolt from my relatively new to cycling point of view.</p>\n<p>There are loads of opinions out there already about what bit of kit to get to display your cycling info. Wahoo Element Bolt reviews are mainly written by almost professional cyclists, so I hoping my opinions and thoughts fit in somewhere for those of us not putting out unbelievable times. Indeed technology like this isn’t new, but its leaps and bounds above what was capable only a few years ago. From my novice experience of riding, this is my first computer since those cheap little boxes that you had to attach a magnet to your spokes, but when considering upping your game and spending a bit more time in the saddle there are only two things to consider.</p>\n<h2>Tracking All The Things</h2>\n<p>Do you want to track everything with your phone, and if not, do you buy a Garmin or a Wahoo? The more established Garmin has plenty of fans, but the real attraction for me was the huge battery life leap from the Wahoo, and the relatively cheep price. Yes this thing is going to set you back around £190, but it gives you an all singing all dancing cycle computer that should last you years.</p>\n<p>The normal metrics are on board. Screens can be customised to show you speed, time, distance, power, heart rate, elevation and many more. So purists can see this live, review it later and export all the information their heart desires. That wasn’t why I bought this though. I am pretty sure that’s not why anyone would spend this kind of money on a training aid, because it can be done cheaper. Really the beauty of the Wahoo Element Bolt is its integrations with tools that make your cycling better.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Wahoo-Element-Bolt-Screens-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0ca2636195.jpg\" alt=\"Wahoo Element Bolt Screens 1\" width=\"1157\" height=\"372\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>It offers turn by turn navigation, live tracking links to share with friends, route planning and wireless connection to a whole range of other products. This little black box has very quickly become one of my favourite things. Not because it gives me power output and speed information, because it lets me plan my route ahead of time and tells me where to go.</p>\n<p>It has taken me from doing the same old routes to exploring more and finding my way around with confidence. I knew my local back roads very little considering I have lived here for more than 10 years, but using the companion app or online services live Strava, I can plot out a ride and complete it with much less stress. I am sure all the analytics displayed are important to those more deeply into cycling, but that’s just not me at the moment.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Image-15-05-2020-08-39-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5d6cfa2a36.jpg\" alt=\"Image 15 05 2020 08 39 1\" width=\"2000\" height=\"955\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Smart Connection</h2>\n<p>Initial setup of the Wahoo Element Bolt requires very little user input, but it does require a smartphone to set it up on first boot. After using it for signing in and setting up, you will also need the companion app connected if you want to customise anything. This wont be an issue for almost anyone but unfortunately as with all companion apps, it is terribly designed. Thankfully the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elemnt-companion-app-for-wahoo/id1049469683?mt=8\">Element app</a> is very easy to use and understand. Here you can also connect your Wahoo Element Bolt to other services such as Strava, Komoot and even Apple Health on iOS.</p>\n<p>You can also connect the Wahoo Element to other Bluetooth and WiFi extras such as heart rate monitors, power sensors and loads of other options. If like me you have the Shimano DI2 with wireless you can even set up the two buttons on the shifters to change pages on the Wahoo. You can connect it to just about anything and any service imaginable.</p>\n<p>Using Apple Health to triage all of your rides is a great tool, and counts towards your daily move goal as long as you sync through Strava. For some reason I couldn’t get the Wahoo Element app to give Apple Health any calorie information, yet Strava does <a href=\"https://gr36.com/strava-record-calories-apple-health/\">after a bit of setup</a>. Unless you need to change the screens of the unit or check for an update reliance on the smartphone app is minimal if you use other services such as Strava. Allowing customisation through the app is a clever decision and removes the need for a touchscreen on the unit meaning interaction is done by good old trusty buttons.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Wahoo-Element-Bolt-Review-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8351033557.jpg\" alt=\"Wahoo Element Bolt Review 1\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>This is great if you live somewhere like the UK and need to wear gloves often. The three buttons on the front and two on the side allow for changing pages of information or zooming in and out of the displayed navigation map. The screen is bright and easy to read whatever the weather. Despite being criticised as only being black and white I think this is the right decision for ease of use.</p>\n<p>If you are the type of rider that takes your phone out with you so you stay connected, the Wahoo Element Bolt will also flash up messages and phone calls if you wish. Meaning you will still be contactable when out and about. The screen will show a preview of any messages, with customisable sound and LED alerts to something that needs your attention.</p>\n<p>The strip of LEDs across the top can also be customised to alert you to different kinds of things. From Strava sections, to navigation alerts or your training metrics you want to highlight. This unit really does have it all for beginners to elite athletes.</p>\n<h2>Better By Design</h2>\n<p>Wahoo have made several design choices when producing the Element Bolt that all play together to build a complete package. Decisions such as the black and white screen don’t detract from the unit in anyway, save battery life and increase the visibility when out cycling. Something that may seem like a ‘con’ when compared to much of the Garmin range is actually the right decision.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"bolt_aero-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a3d3bd4696.jpg\" alt=\"Bolt aero 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"294\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>This rings even more true when you consider that battery life is absolutely insane. I have never used an alternative, however Wahoo claim it is up to 300% better than the Garmin 520 and even a 3 hour ride while navigating clips the battery by only 40%. Given the size of the Wahoo Element Bolt, that is pretty amazing battery life.</p>\n<p>Wahoo have also thought about the Aerodynamics of the unit when designing. Claiming 50% less drag than competitors, with a sleek and all in one deign that clips safe and secure to its holder with zero fuss. I’m not looking to shave seconds off my ride here, but I appreciate something well designed and doesn’t look like you’ve attached a huge tablet to your handlebars. The Wahoo Element Bolt will pretty much go unnoticed when you don’t need it, but provide everything when you do.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>With all of this packed into hardware that Wahoo claims has 50 percent less drag than a Garmin Edge 520, and triple the battery life there isn’t a lot not to love. If your buying this to shave off a few seconds in a time trial, its got you covered. If indeed your training had reached it peak and you need another push forward, this will help. However if you need something to help you get out and about a bit more and help you along the way as an enthusiast then the Wahoo Element Bolt is pretty perfect too.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "How To Set Up Strava To Record Calories In Apple Health",
				"content_html": "<p>After switching from recording my cycling on the Apple Watch to a <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/wahoo-element-bolt/\">Wahoo Element</a> Bolt my activity levels seemed to suck. After previously smashing my move goals I was left short on some days even after a reasonable ride. Simply because Strava wasn’t calculating my calories and it took me ages to find out why.</p>\n<p>After a few days of Googling around and finding all sorts of weird information I <a href=\"https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360039627911-Apple-Watch-App-not-counting-calories\">eventually discovered a fix</a>. I tracked the issue down to a really simple one, but something that isn’t immediately obvious — you need to make sure that Strava has your weight and your bikes weight recorded.</p>\n<p>You can only do all of this on the website and not the mobile app, so make sure you can log in on the web. Your weight is changeable in the app to your profile, but you can’t add or customise your gear for some reason. You will need to log in online, create your bike, and make sure you also give it a weight. A rough guess is fine but you can usually track down the correct weight with a quick search of the manufactures website.</p>\n<p>Once this is competed your new runs and bike rides will contain calorie information that will be passed to Apple Health. If you want to get this for older rides, just tap edit activity and then save it again. This will pass the last few days worth of activity back to Apple Health but not all of it, and it’s temperamental at best with syncing.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" title=\"Image-15-05-2020-08-52-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/871c0624ed.jpg\" alt=\"Image 15 05 2020 08 52 1\" /></figure>\n<p><br />This should mean you are getting all of the credit for your rides going forward. It’s surprising how addictive filling your rings on your Apple Watch is, and Apple Health makes it easy to share your activity data if a medical issue requires it. Strava is great for keeping all your rides logged, but keep it in other places too just in case you want to switch at a later date.</p>\n",

				"title": "Charty: Plot Data Directly From Shortcuts",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>If you’ve followed me for a while, you will already know my love of <a href=\"https://gr36.com/tag/automation/\">iOS automation</a>. I am not <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8raOG7HXJoCUygx219fU4A\">Chris Lawley</a> level of obsessed, but anything to make my daily life easier and I am all in! Shortcuts (and before that Workflow) is by far my favourite app for doing this, but the real beauty of Shortcuts is all the apps it plugs into. Almost everything on your home-screen can be automated, and a whole lot more. New app Charty is aiming to remove the hassle of creating graphs and charts, and launches today.</p>\n<p>This is one of those apps that at first you dismiss, but when actually looking around the app you realise just how helpful it can be. That’s because developer Rodrigo Araújo has thought about almost every aspect of the app. Building on the success of his first app <a href=\"https://chatstats.app/\">ChartStat</a> he aims to make it easy for everyone to visualise any kind of data.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Image-06-05-2020-07-57-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/31f2dfd6b3.jpg\" alt=\"Image 06 05 2020 07 57 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"286\" border=\"0\" />There are 27 examples already included in the app ready to be imported into Shortcuts. These powerful Shortcuts can plot data you probably already have on your phone but don’t really look at that often. Displaying them in any of the available 5 different types – bar, line, scatter, pie and donut.</p>\n<p>From there it is amazingly easy to create powerful algorithms that process and create your visualisations from inside Shortcuts. The really great things is that now you can begin to not only collect and store data using Shortcuts, but also combine it with utilities such as <a href=\"https://datajar.app/\">DataJar</a> to build really powerful tools.</p>\n<p>I have been using this quite a bit to plot out my heart rate changes over time, and my distance cycled due to my attempt to get fitter. The graphs in Apple Health are very restrictive so I am over the moon this app makes it easy for me to compare and highlight fitness issues. The graphs are amazingly customisable so I see exactly what I am exporting. I can then send these wherever I like to save and refer back to later.</p>\n<p>In my limited use the app has already proved really helpful. Everyone should give it a go just for the amazing alternative icons. With that said I expect to see <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/update-on-the-ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-charging-speed-45w-charger-tested/\">Matt Birchler</a> really putting this to work over the next few weeks — he loves a graph!</p>\n<p>Charty is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/charty-for-shortcuts/id1494386093\">available now</a> for free with 4 Shortcut actions available — New Chart, Add Series To Chart, Delete Chart and Get Information From All Chart. You can upgrade the app for a one off payment of $4.99 to get extra shortcuts actions as well as a whole load of extras, but if you purchase this within the first month of release it will only be $2.99.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

It’s a debate for another time, because I have had my hands on the new Magic Keyboard for my 2018 iPad Pro for just a few hours and already have loads of thoughts to share — but a full review will follow later.</p>\n<p>I have, for the most part, been avoiding the weirdly negative reviews and comparisons that focus on small issues blown out of proportion. As I covered in <a href=\"https://gr36.com/greg-thinks-things-3/\">my newsletter</a>, I’ve been really excited to get this keyboard and it arrived a day later than it was supposed to. So I found myself consuming quite a few reviews to satiate my desire to use it. But that is not to say that if I had been forced to write this within the first hour or so of taking the Magic keyboard out the box my feelings would have been very different.</p>\n<h2>It’s Heavy</h2>\n<p>Let’s get this out the way straight away. Attaching the Magic Keyboard to your iPad Pro makes it heavier. Not just a bit heavier, there is a lot more weight and no avoiding this. This keyboard is not a Smart Keyboard by any stretch of the imagination. So if you’re looking for something similar you’re going to be very disappointed.</p>\n<p>Many reviews have focused on this. While comparisons to the weight of laptops and other Windows variations are somewhat valid, they are a little logically flawed. Sure it’s about the same weight as a MacBook Pro, so is the argument that I should carry that instead? Whereas it’s down to the weight you want to carry. Without getting into the specs of the different machines and OS, there are some huge differences. I can’t take the screen off a MacBook, nor annotate a PDF by drawing on the screen, so we are not comparing Apples here. If I’m going to carry 3lb I will carry a 12.9” iPad and Magic Keyboard no question — whereas many others may not.</p>\n<p>Now we have that out of the way, we can move on. There are numerous reasons for the weight of this accessory, which I wont go into here, but it ads a proper keyboard. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/the_ipad_magic_keyboard\">Gruber summed it up best</a> when he described previous attempts iPad keyboards as covers you can type on. There was nothing wrong with these versions, I used them very happily for a long time. Whereas this is a proper, full sized keyboard with back light and decent key travel. With a trackpad thrown in for good measure. This is tiny when compared to any other Apple version but about the same size as everything else on the market. One thing to note is that it is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1252541993063976962?s=20\">ridiculously loud when clicking</a>.</p>\n<p>The keyboard keys are’t quite as bad, but they are not far off. They give in my opinion a perfectly clicky feedback. With the right amount of movement in the keys to make typing a delight. Typing on them feels somewhere between the current Mac Magic Keyboard, with a little of the stiffness of the butterfly keyboard left in. But to be clear these are lovely scissor switches, so lets <a href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/557431/apple-finally-acknowledges-its-new-macbook-keyboards/\">hope they last</a>.</p>\n<p>I have no reason to think they wont, because everything about the unit feels premium and worth the money. Sure this <em>is</em> an expensive accessory, but in a world where the Smart Keyboard Folio is £199, for the extra £150 you get much more for your money. One of my initial trepidation’s was the rigidity of the keyboard when using it on my lap, but I am happy to report there is zero flex. Both of the hinges for positioning the iPad feel study and robust, clicking into place with reassuring tactile feedback.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"apple_ipad-pro-keyboard_now-available_04152020-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9a19a20761.jpg\" alt=\"Apple ipad pro keyboard now available 04152020 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"520\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Screen Positioning</h2>\n<p>The Magic Keyboard floating style is quintessentially Apple. Say what you want about a better design, but this screams designed in Cupertino. You’re going to see loads of these in coffee shops when we are allowed out again. That’s not to say the design is the right choice, thats a very personal opinion. It just looks like something Apple would do. The design also brings the iPad closer to your face which is a nice touch, saving some neck ache. The two hinges allow movement from 90 to 130 degrees.</p>\n<p>This range of movement sounds like plenty depending on your usage. I am not getting into the whole drawing mode debate comparing to something that has never been advertised, but unfortunately it isn’t much movement at all. I feel as if the screen positions are almost as limiting as they were before. This isn’t going to bother <em>me</em> going forward and I completely understand why it is like this. However the furthest 130degree position is just about suitable for my needs and at this point  still feels a little top heavy when on my lap.</p>\n<h2>Wants For The Future</h2>\n<p>It is very early days in my usage, and despite my early disappointment I am happily typing away on it.</p>\n<p>The Magic Keyboard feels very much like a first-gen product with some important lessons learnt from the covers that have gone before. There are design choices that have been made to get the best from the form factor. Ultimately boiling down to a few nitpicking details.</p>\n<p>I’d love to see the power connector able to also transfer data so I don’t need any more dongles hanging out the side, but this would mean a redesign of the iPad technology rather than a better case.</p>\n<p>I would also like to see the keyboard get a row of function keys or at the very least an FN key to perhaps use the numbered row. I don’t adjust the backlight to my keyboard very often, but when I do I expect it to be right in front of me along with volume control and screen brightness.</p>\n<p>I will refrain from any major judgements just yet and save them for a full review, but there are surprisingly few things I would change, and none that put me off completely.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>With all things said, this is the sort of keyboard I have always wanted for my iPad. The robustness of a proper keyboard was without doubt a limiting factor in previous years and one of the reasons I started using a Laptop again.</p>\n<p>The iPad Pro Magic Keyboard is the best keyboard you can get for your iPad Pro but its far from perfect. This isn’t;t going to be for everyone. If you want a laptopesk experience on iOS then look no further. For anything else, move along.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "MX Master 3: A Master Pointer For Most",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>For years of my life, I have never strayed away from the mouse supplied with my computer. That usually meant horrible PC vendors attempts and more recently an Apple Magic mouse or trackpad. There isn’t much magic about these mice, and it’s only when you use one all day every day that you realise just how uncomfortable it is. Sure you can use gestures, but it’s just far too flat and unergonomic.</p>\n<p>With this, my journey into finding a suitable mouse lead me down far too many YouTube rabbit holes – but I landed on the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QWvjgF\">Logitech MX Master 3.</a>  As you may already be able to tell this is the third iteration of Logitechs well thought after MX Master range. This new version is an iteration on the first few but offers a few tweaks and changes that make it a worthy upgrade and the best version to date.</p>\n<h2>Ergonomics</h2>\n<p>I don’t think I am alone in thinking that the most important thing from a mouse is comfort. It can have as many buttons and gestures on it as you like, but if it’s shaped weird or just wrong for your working position, then you’re going to struggle. The high curves and comfortable rounded edges of this mouse make it one of the most comfortable I have had the pleasure of using – as long as you’re right-handed of course. The MX Master 3 fits perfectly into my hand, and also anyone else that has laid ether hands on it.</p>\n<p>There is something weird about other people using this mouse because it feels so personal to you. The customisation options and buttons feel part of you and the way you work. It’s full click things, glowing things and more scrolling stuff than you can shake a stick at. When you think you’ve found them all, Logitech throws a few more in there hidden under the thumb rest or underneath your palm.</p>\n<p>What they didn’t include was a place to store the accompanying dongle, but I’m not sure if you need this with modern laptops and tablets. Mine is still sitting in the box after using it once. However, this mouse offers a vast range of connectivity to Mac, PC and iOS.</p>\n<p>If you’re stuck, it works over USB and not only that you can charge it and use it at the same time! What a revelation. Battery life is ridiculous for the charging time it needs. Plug it into a USB cable and leave it an hour and you’ll be good to go for a reported 70 hours. In fact, in the two months, I have been using it I have charged it twice and been using it upwards of 6 hours a day.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"MBLTTE-1-1-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/771fe11e9e.jpg\" alt=\"MBLTTE 1 1 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The great thing third party mice usually allow you to do is to have multiple devices set up at once. The MX Master 3 is no different, allowing you to switch between 3 different options at the touch of a button. Meaning you can switch to using a different computer or as I have seamlessly switch between macOS and iOS with the touch of a button. If you know the pain of having to unpair and repair that Apple requires, you’ll understand why this is a massive deal. When using the MX Master 3 with iOS and the new 13.4 update it works very well indeed. However you miss out on all of the customisations and some of the gestures — so this isn’t all good news.</p>\n<p>The multi-paring options are for those that may use a different machine at home and work, or perhaps switch between a desktop and laptop, which is where maybe the black magic function of the MX Master 3 comes to light. <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/options/page/flow-multi-device-control\">Logitech Flow</a> introduces another level above universal copy and paste. Only by having your devices on the same wi-fi network, you can seamlessly copy and paste files from one machine to another, even across operating systems.</p>\n<h2>Logi-Options: Loads Of Them</h2>\n<p>What is most surprising is that they manage to do this with minimal setup and a lot less hassle than I expected. You will need to grant Logi-options, the supporting software, some permission when installing. Still, in exchange, you get the ability to customise every single button and scroll wheel on the device to your liking. It doesn’t just stop at tracking or double click speed like some pointers. There are what seems like limitless options to customise all interaction and even change this depending on what application you are using. Especially great for those with very particular workflows or interaction needs.</p>\n<p>Logitech provides a few default profiles and will offer to install these for you so you can see what other people use for each app. However, it takes very little time to build up a robust handful of shortcuts for your most-used functions. For example, I have set the forward button to act as a shortcut back to Selection (V) in Illustrator and the back button as the pen tool (P) — these are my most used tools, and I switch back and forth all the time. This may seem pointless because these are straight forward keyboard shortcuts, but I can worry about other things instead of reaching out for my keyboard.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot-2020-04-01-at-13.22.56-1-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d0d7896d6f.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020 04 01 at 13 22 56 1 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"416\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I was soon saving loads of time adopting shortcuts into my workflow and scrolling around with ease in almost every application I have. The MX Master 3 features both a horizontal and vertical scroll wheel for the ultimate ability to move around a canvas or scroll through your timeline. The most interesting of which is the vertical one, which now uses magnets to minimise noise and remove wear and tear. It still retains the easy switching between tense and free-scrolling that other versions have – the downside of which means I leave it spinning for way longer than I should. What can I say it’s my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1247867314822938627?s=20\">desk fidget spinner</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the best buttons to master (excuse the pun) on this mouse is the gesture button. By using the button under your thumb, it allows you to have five different shortcuts built-in. Press to open mission control, hold and move backwards for expose, or side to side to switch between apps. If you don’t currently use gestures on your Magic Mouse or Trackpad, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RlMkAW\">MX Master 3</a> will persuade you to start using multiple desktops and master expose for good.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"MBLTTE-4-1-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/20487e647f.jpg\" alt=\"MBLTTE 4 1 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n<p>All these words above boil down to one thing. This is the best mouse you can buy for productivity. It’s going to cost a little more, but it’s going to speed up your workflow no end. The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RlMkAW\">MX Master 3</a> is overkill if you don’t spend a lot of time at your desk, but it’s the real deal for everyone else. One of the few things I haven’t suffered any buyer remorse over for a long time and I don’t see myself going back to uncomfortable Apple mice ever again.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "Is It Safe To Leave Your iPad Plugged In?",
				"content_html": "<p>Many people are already using an iPad as their desktop ‘computer’, and with the launch of the new magic keyboard, this may rise further. The new magic keyboard for iPad Pro has a USB-C passthrough for power and as such will mean your iPad could be left on charge all the time while on your desk – is this safe to do? That’s a hard question to ask, but hopefully, I found an answer.</p>\n<p>This question isn’t a new one, and it’s one that everyone has an opinion on. Much as everyone complaining in a shop has a friend that works for trading standards; everyone becomes a physicist when talking about charging your battery. Leading to much hearsay and loads of conflicting information.</p>\n<p>The straight to the point answer is that battery technology has drastically improved since people started charging their mobiles every night. Back then, there were all sorts of scare stories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/dec/05/blackberry-investigate-exploding-phone\">exploding Blackberry’s</a> and only charging your phone <a href=\"https://uk.pcmag.com/features/92897/charging-your-phone-overnight-battery-myths-debunked\">from below 10%</a>. The myths are vast and frankly downright weird at times, but it’s safe to say that there is loads of technology built into the battery of your iPad to protect it.</p>\n<p>Since 2012, Apple has made <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-ipad-charging-fine-keep-it-plugged-in/\">charging much more complex</a> and made loads of improvements aimed at maximising your battery life. This is universal across the range of devices, so what’s suitable for one is ideal for another. Battery university (yes that’s a real thing) has a vast array of information on Lithium-based Batteries, and are often quoted as a good source for information.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>In theory, such a mechanism should work forever, but cycling, elevated temperature and ageing decrease the performance over time. –</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries\">Battery University</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They conclude after much research and loads of graphs that the user can do a few things to prolong the longevity of their battery. Highlighting that “The worst situation is keeping a fully charged battery at elevated temperatures” – so avoiding high temperatures should be a significant indicator towards maximising life.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cd16cccb76.jpg\" alt=\"iPad Pro 11\" /></figure>\n<p>The number of cycles that you iPad will go though does add to the wear on your battery, but there is no clear answer to what a cycle is. A more important factor is elevated temperatures. So in theory, keep your battery charged and away from heat and you should be ok. Apple says <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/\">between 0 and 35 degrees C</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Evaluating battery life on counting cycles is not conclusive because a discharge may vary in-depth and there are no clearly defined standards of what constitutes a cycle –</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries\">Battery University</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second piece of information you hear is the level of battery charge you should be completing. A considerable wealth of <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/85fqkz/is_it_a_good_idea_to_keep_my_ipad_pro_plugged_in/\">forum posts</a> and opinions display numbers that seem plucked from thin air. However, research does suggest that a battery should not be charged to 100%. Ever. The good news is that your battery never reaches that far, 100% in the software is not 100% battery capacity – so there is no need to worry.</p>\n<p>Since iOS13 Apple has been working on machine learning your habits and maximising battery life. Once the OS displays your iPad is at 100%, it will <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210512\">intelligently</a> discharge and recharge the battery very gradually. Apple has also intelligently accounted for issues that seem to arise after 80% capacity. Once your iPad is charged to above 80%, the charging rate is dramatically reduced. So think of the last 20% as what’s generally referred to as a trickle charge.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>One of the most prominent tones running through the indie web is being able to own your content. To publish it online and be able to do whatever you want with it. Some people publish to WordPress, some to Medium, others may build their own static sites, but the real problem with most of these approaches is being able to move your content to somewhere else easily.</p><p>I first ran into this pain when closing down my very first WordPress website. I’d been working hard on building a Jekyll based static site because hosting was becoming expensive, and it was the best place to put everything. When it comes to all blog posts and images, it proved a nightmare. Sure there are ways to do it, <a href=\"https://blog.webjeda.com/wordpress-to-jekyll-migration/\">kind of</a>. However, none of the options work very well, or even at all. So you’re left to slog through all of your posts and copy them over.</p><p>Pretty easy to do if you’re only a few in, but a mammoth task if you’re as post happy as I am or been witting for several years. Several times during the process, I considered giving up, and a lesser person may have done so, begging the question of if this is intentional? If you own your content, then it should be easy to move from place to place, and platforms really should think about this as a selling point to their hosting.</p><p>Jeff Perry, the master of moving his blog to different providers, feels this <a href=\"https://jeffperry.blog/2020/03/2/%F0%9F%94%97-the-great-blog-cleanup\">more than anyone</a>. He found WordPress to be a massive pain, and only Blot creator David Murfiled goes out of his way to help.</p><blockquote><em>I will say moving to Blot was easy because the creator, Dave, is probably the most helpful and responsive person I’ve ever worked with. When I was using  </em><br /><br /><em><a href=\"https://t.co/OfH9MKIBh8?amp=1\">[micro.blog](http://micro.blog)</a></em><br /><br /><em> I felt that the back end was needlessly complicated, and for WordPress, my worst experience was with WordPress themselves because they charge up the ass for little support – Jeff Perry</em></blockquote><p>Manton Reece creator of micro.blog <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2017/11/24/blog-archive-format.html\">talked about this quite a while ago</a>, and proposed that providers implement a standard. Whenever I hear these calls for a standard to be implemented, I am always reminded of the <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\">XDCD comic</a>.<br /></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/cc8fb1a291.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Standards 1\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"standards-1.png\" /></figure><p>But clearly, something needs to be done. Each platform offers the ability to import and export options, but very few of these work together, or much fo the time even work very well. Indeed micro.blog is the only platform I have seen that goes so far as to make your import go as smoothly as possible. Creating bespoke options for Instagram, Medium, WordPress, Jekyll and many others. I can’t speak for getting your content out again, but the transparency of this service should help at least a little.</p><p>During a recent round trip to Ghost Pro, and back again, I imported and exported all of my posts 3 or 4 times. Even though I was doing this on the same platform, this still didn’t work fully. Leaving me to trawl through all of my posts and add in missing images and move data to the correct place. So even the self-proclaimed <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">home of independent publishing</a> suffers from the same old issues as everyone else. Platforms want your data, but don’t want you to take it again without some pain.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>It isn’t very often something truly new comes to market. All right we’ve seen folding phones before, but not one this particular way, and not one available to the  mass market. The Galaxy Fold was horrendously expensive and had some longevity concerns, and as yet you can’t buy the Moto Razr <a href=\"https://shop.ee.co.uk/mobile-phones/pay-monthly/motorola-razr-black/details?WT.MC_ID=ON_MEC_S_700000000044366_Brand+_+PAYM+_+Motorola+_+RAZR+_+Hybrid+_+EXACT_p50199620492&amp;WT.srch=1&amp;s_kwcid=AL!932!3!404227664639!e!!g!!ee%20motorola%20razr&amp;mchannel=ppc&amp;ds_rl=1238748&amp;logo=TUR1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAs67yBRC7ARIsAF49CdWzBMN56EYSPHpTgdeM5p9ycaXBDLMqCRk7vkHF7f3huKKrbntWwq0aAgbIEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">other than on an expensive 24 month</a> contract on EE. So when the chance came for me to not only get <a href=\"https://gr36.com/galaxy-fold-handson/\">hands on with one</a> but use one – I got <a href=\"https://gr36.com/advance-tech-exciting/\">a tad over excited</a>.</p>\n<p>Ok, the Galaxy Z Flip has some <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/16/21139897/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-ultra-thin-glass-durability-scratch-test-jerryrigeverything\">longevity concerns of its own</a>, but I don’t think that is enough to dismiss such a new device.  It’s easy to be dismissive of something that doesn’t fit into your vision of what a device should be. Yet all others around me got excited when I first took the phone out of the box and that speaks volumes. All the insides of the Z Flip box are standard Samsung, yet when you take the phone out and peel off the plastic, something entirely different happens.</p>\n<p>The device feels sturdy and reassuring, well built and engineered, but not bulky or uncomfortable. Not only much more comfortable and lighter than an iPhone 11, but considerably taller and slimmer. I am reminded of the memes that were made around the time of the iPhone 5 launch, and when you use a device like the Galaxy Z Flip and indeed the Note10 line, it shows how right Apple were back then. A slimmer taller screen is better in almost every way.</p>\n<h2>Real Talk After The Fold</h2>\n<p>The folding screen of the Z Flip is both marvelled and ridiculed at each point by technology commentators, but you can’t argue its usefulness. You may scoff and think that the Galaxy Fold is a much more useful device, but that the Z flip does allow me to have a 6.7″ screen device, but not feel one in my pocket. When not in use the device slims down to about the same size as a coaster, all be it a heavier one that feels a little weird in your pocket.</p>\n<p>When in use the screen is comically tall, there is no getting around it. One handed use can be a little clumsy if the app you’re using is top-heavy, but a tall screen gives you a great way to consume written content, be it social media, emails or blog posts. I love reading on this device because it’s much more suited to 90% of web usage and fits nicely in your palm. The screen itself is bright and vivid, some will scoff at it ‘only’ being 1080p but it does it’s job well with no issues.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Galxy-Z-Flip-In-Hand-1.jpeg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1ddd0502ae.jpg\" alt=\"Galxy Z Flip In Hand 1\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" border=\"0\" />The only issue with scrolling vertically on this screen in particular is the crease in the middle. It is unavoidable, you <em>can</em> see it, and anyone that says otherwise is mistaken. It sticks out like a sore thumb, mainly when using a dark UI (which I much prefer) or when the screen is empty of content. Even if you get used to seeing the crease after a few days of use like the notch on the iPhone; you feel it every time you swipe around and if you want a folding phone you have to find a way to make peace with this fact.</p>\n<h2>Minimalist Phone?</h2>\n<p>That shouldn’t put you off though, the crease is unapologetic. It is there the first time you pick the device up and won’t go away. But it also shouldn’t get any worse, because it is purposely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1228736762186551297?s=20\">put there by Samsung</a> in the factory, so it doesn’t develop over time. It doesn’t go as far as ruining your experience of the phone; it is just something that is a trade-off for having a folding phone at this point in time. If having a crease in the screen bothers you, steer clear, but it’s a worthwhile trade-off for being able to fold your phone in half and put it away.</p>\n<p>While we are here, it seems logical to talk about folding the phone in half, because you won’t be able to stop – perhaps ever. The hinge gives tactical feedback but also provides a smooth transition. Samsung says its a semi-rigid hinge, allowing for it to be used in that weird half folded way that Samsung thinks will appeal to ‘influencers’. So gone is the click into place that Galaxy Fold had when opening, to be replaced by a more pleasant experience. Unfortunately, you won’t be doing the communicator flip open like the devices of old – well you can, but it doesn’t <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theMrMobile/status/1228410045823582215?s=20\">work very well</a>.</p>\n<p>There is also a finality of closing the Z Flip that you don’t get with other devices. Something akin to putting the lid down on your laptop. It draws a line under your phone usage and puts it away. It will help those looking to minimalise their phone usage because the screen is now away and out of tempting site. It’s not as if you can do anything on the ridiculous front screen anyway.</p>\n<p>If Samsung are going for a way to minimalist your phone, they hit the nail on the head, because the front display is ridiculous. Perhaps not in a wrong way, but I wish they have thought about using it a little more. Not going as far as they did with the Galaxy Fold, but an active display similar to the Razr would have been perfect. You are not going to do anything with this screen except glimpse notifications when they come in and check the time.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"DSC0029-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a89a5a5cc5.jpg\" alt=\"DSC0029 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" border=\"0\" />I don’t want to comment on battery life much further than to say that I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t last you a day of usage. During my two days taking photos and playing with the phone, it still has more than 25% battery left after taking it off charge at 7 am. After a bit more usage, I will share full battery life expectations.</p>\n<h2>Camera</h2>\n<p>On the initial set up and test, I was disappointed with the performance of the camera, but there was a software update waiting for that improved things dramatically. I have a feeling this update is not installed on demo devices and some hands on versions I have seen, so perhaps take some video revews with a small pinch of salt.</p>\n<p>I have to prefaces all my words with the fact I am not a fan of the processing done by Samsungs cameras. They often look overly processed sometimes downright ridiculous colour saturation in them. I prefer something much more natural-looking, and I am undeniably used to iPhone images.</p>\n<p>As well as the usual family snaps, I took the Galaxy Z Flip with me on a day out to <a href=\"https://www.thedeep.co.uk/\">The Deep Aquarium</a>, mainly because it is often one of the most challenging environments to get good snaps in. Dark rooms, with brightly lit tanks full of colourful fish that don’t stay still. I must say I am very impressed with its performance, not everything came out perfectly, but there were very few pictures I had to delete. At times I have often struggled to make Samsung cameras work for me, even as recently as the Note 10+ – having to turn features off and dial back processing – but this is not one of these times. Find a gallery below.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Galaxy Z Flip Around The Home</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I am at a certain point in my life where each iPhone is as boring as the last one. I am excited by what other brands are doing and am always tempted to use something else but never do. I never want to say I will or won’t do anything else but switch back to an iPhone but using the Z Flip has opened my eyes to a brand new world. I enjoy the feel of having a much smaller device in my pocket and folding it out when needed – and to be honest, I also said this about the Galaxy Fold.</p>\n<p>The Galaxy Z Flip is another step up in use case, a device that offers an improvement where the Galaxy Fold felt like you had to use gloves on it, but also an eye-opening form factor switch. The taller, slimmer screen is much easier to use and displays much of what I do online all day much better than anything else.</p>\n<p>Pulling out the Z Flip leaves people around you genuinely amazed, and I have had loads of questions about it. Sure we are all aware these phones exist, but the general public doesn’t seem to be. Unfortunately, when showing it off, the black version I have is a fingerprint magnet, the same as the black Note10+ I had, so I spend far too much time is spent wiping off the body. The finish is also a bit too slippery than I would like, couple this with the smaller frame to carry and I feel a little uneasy using it outside.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"DSC0036-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8a8a85b8cf.jpg\" alt=\"DSC0036 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" border=\"0\" />With all these words out the way – I am at a point as I write this that I am stuck at a Schrödinger’s phone. I both think the device is a game-changing smartphone and also a bit of a gimmick. Depending on the time of day, I am both marvelled and miffed at the Galaxy Z Flip. It offers me a use case like nothing before but is it worth a whopping £1300 price tag?</p>\n<p>By far Galaxy Z Flip is the best folding phone you can buy. It is also a terrific smartphone that offers a brand new use case never before seen. I am just not 100% convinced that use case warrants the price tag or if it exists at all. I love using the Galaxy Z Flip because it is something completely new, but will that wear thin over time? Is this a solution to something that doesn’t need solving? These are all questions in my head and unique to each person.</p>\n<p>What I woudl say is the dismissive feeling I have seen towards this phone are cimoletely unwarranted. This device feels like the start of something special and there is no denying it. I will try and answer the rest of the questions I have over the coming days – stay tuned.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

When I say things, I mean all sorts of things are going to be foldable, and it doesn’t matter your definition. It could be a tablet that folds into a phone-sized device or a phone that folds into something smaller. That fact that this year proves to be genuinely exciting for foldable devices should be enough.</p>\n<p>The scepticism is somewhat understandable given the false starts with both the Galaxy Fold and Huawei Mate X, but now phones such as the Moto Razr and Galaxy Z Flip are hitting the mass market this should be fading. However, there seems to be lots of negativity still.</p>\n<p>The detractors against such a device are vocal when any mention of both the Razr and Z Flip are spoken about on social media. With a consensus that a folding phone is pointless. To a certain degree that may be the case for your use case, but the fact that these devices are now available – with the latter sporting a glass screen – should be enough to get excited about.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/96f4685a1b.jpg\" alt=\"960x0 1\" title=\"960x0-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"395\" />The fact that Samsung has made such a huge step forward just months <a href=\"https://gr36.com/galaxy-fold-handson/\">after the Galaxy Fold</a> was released is bordering on insane. If this kind of pace of innovation can be maintained, then devices that will appeal to you as a consumer are right around the corner. Not every device is made of every type of user, but the fact remains that these devices are made for some users and selling very well.</p>\n<p>Opinions regarding the device not appealing to your use case are one thing, but detracting from such a significant improvement in technology is another. It is an exciting prospect to have such a device hit the shelves, and I, for one, would love to get hands-on with one soon.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"zero-fasting-review.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a6ba75fa04.jpg\" alt=\"Zero fasting review\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" /><br />A few days ago, I shared <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/2020/02/13/intermittent-fasting-and.html\">what intermittent fasting had done for me</a> and the health benefits I have felt. This app has helped me get going on my journey and is now an essential tool for tracking my body – it’s time to look at <a href=\"https://www.zerofasting.com/\">Zero fasting tracker</a>. Available <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1168348542\">on iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zerofasting.zero\">Android</a>, I am using the iOS version installed on my iPhone 11 Pro and Series 5 Apple Watch.</p>\n<p>This app will only appeal to you if you are intermittently fasting, and even if you are, most people still won’t rely on one. I only started looking for something when I needed a kick to keep me going and also to keep track of my habits better. With that, the Zero app is full of fasting information on why to do it, how to do it and the answers to loads of questions you might have.</p>\n<p>I found when first starting out it was both a hindrance and help to have something counting down the hours until I could eat again. So you might look at other options first – but what the app does well is make everything easy to find and straight forward to understand. Splitting areas into four tabs across the bottom to see your timer, check out the fasting options,  delve into your fasting history or learn more about fasting in general.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Zero-fasting-screenshots-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c9c410001e.jpg\" alt=\"Zero fasting screenshots 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"478\" border=\"0\" />Zero enables you to start and stop your fasting quickly and gives you default options for regular ratios and also custom options. You can also get handy notifications (if you choose to switch them on) when you are in the final hour of fasting and indeed when you can start eating again. All customisable using the fasts tab at the bottom.If you’re feeling hardcore, you can track a full fast for up to 168 hours!</p>\n<p>Users will spend the majority of the time starting and stopping the timer from the timer tab. Featuring a beautiful big clock, counting down the hours until your feeding window, or counting up the hours you have been feeding for. The big green (or red) button starts and stops your fast dependant what state you are in. If you forget you can edit start and stop times, and leave feedback on your fast at the end of each cycle.</p>\n<h2>Apple Watch App</h2>\n<p>You can also start and stop fasting with the companion Apple Watch App. There isn’t much more you can do on the watch, but it does come with complications in a range of sizes to slot into your choice of Watch face. I found this too overbearing and reminded me too often, which proved annoying after a while, but having a tap on your wrist when there is only an hour more to go can be helpful.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Zero-fasting-Applewatch-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9a1d948cdd.jpg\" alt=\"Zero fasting Applewatch 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"399\" border=\"0\" />It would be great to be able to edit fast start points and change the ratios on the Apple Watch in future updates. If I make a mistake or want to check my history, I have to pull my phone out, whereas a swipe across to different areas would be useful. You are able to change the number of hours you want to fast for before starting and this updates the iOS app information.</p>\n<p>As well as a glorified alarm system, the app will track every fast you do and display it in one of the easiest to understand designs I have used. All the information is straight forward and easy to navigate. You will find information on your fasts, comparisons in time, and if you hit your intended target. Along with this, the app pulls heart rate data from an Apple Watch, allowing you to see trends easily. Since starting, I can see a pronounced decrease in resting heart rate, and this provides more positive feedback that everything is going well.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Zero-fasting-history-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/23374de776.jpg\" alt=\"Zero fasting history 1\" width=\"1125\" height=\"955\" border=\"0\" />Of course, there is a certain amount of gamification attempted by the app, encouraging you to put together ’streaks; and awarding badges. You can buy into this if you wish, but there is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6096297/\">some research</a> to say this <em>does</em> help motivation for health-related areas, so it’s understandable these kind of features are here.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, you can find answers to all of your questions in the Zero Learn tab. It’s filled full of interesting information and blog-type posts that help get (and keep) you going. If you can’t find the answer here, it’s not worth knowing. Of course, only people that want to start or are already fasting will even download the app never mind about go digging in here, so my definition of interesting might be subjective.</p>\n<p>If you want to get started intermittent fasting, or you need something to track your cycles going forward – look <a href=\"https://www.zerofasting.com/\">no further than Zero</a>. I can’t find a bad word to say about it, and it’s become invaluable to me.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

Looking to subscriptions service and news aggregators, despite <a href=\"https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/apple-news-forcing/\">my initial hate</a> – Apple News won me over.</p>\n<p>It turns out I didn’t need to use it more; I didn’t need to ‘train the algorithm’, I just needed to turn off the news part! You see, I hate viewing or reading the news – it is that simple. It is full of twisted and corrupted stores that are either designed or portrayed in such a way to manipulate your emotions.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" title=\"Apple-news-settings-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4b3bfa49a1.jpg\" alt=\"Apple news settings 1\" /></figure>\n<p>There is a way to do this, but it’s hidden away in the settings titled “Restrict Stories in Today”. Not a great label for a toggle that should be much easier to find, but I would presume Apple doesn’t want you to turn it on. Go to Settings &gt; News and toggle this to on.</p>\n<p>Now all you will see are channels you have subscribed to in the Today tab. No more depressing politics, no more news you don’t want to see, just what you want.</p>\n<p>There are downsides to this, the discovery of new channels can be more difficult, and you might not be kept as upto date with current affairs as you once were. Be a little more mindful of not creating an echo chamber, and you should get on much better. I am now much more open to subscribing to Apple News+, and many of the channels I am now following are News+ channels. So there is a benefit to Apple in the long run – subscription all the things!</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>I still blame <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/the-biggest-change-to-birchtree-in-5-years/\">Matt Birchler</a> for putting the idea in my head, I was quite happy on WordPress (not completely but pretty happy) and then he comes in and introduces <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost to me</a>, and I moved within a few days. On first look it seems like a ridiculously expensive option, and more suited to larger companies, but if you don’t want to splash out the $29/per month there are other options.</p>\n<p>If you want to get a Ghost blog set up, its pretty easy to host it ‘yourself’,  here is a short guide on doing it on a Digital Ocean droplet.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot-2020-01-21-at-10.05.43-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9cb8be9542.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020 01 21 at 10 05 43 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"771\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2>Create A Droplet</h2>\n<p>Signing up for a Digital Ocean account and creating a droplet is really straight forward. Most blogs will only need a $5 a month droplet unless you are getting serious traffic.</p>\n<p>Click on Market place under ‘Choose an image’, this does allow you to choose loads of different options – but if you’re reading this guide you’ll find Ghost under ‘blogs and forums’. Once selected you will see a guide underneath detailing your requirements after your droplet is set up. On this page you will also find all information about the version being installed.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot-2020-01-21-at-10.06.10-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/91ebd54149.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020 01 21 at 10 06 10 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"771\" border=\"0\" />It won’t matter too much where your data centre is, so choose your preference – if things like GDPR and also government monitoring are important to you, then choose wisely. Give your droplet and name and then let it do its thing.</p>\n<h2>After Creation</h2>\n<p>Once completed, you will receive an email from Digital Ocean with your Droplet IP address and SSH password. Keep this information extremely safe and do not share with anyone.</p>\n<h3>Point Your Domain</h3>\n<p>On your Digital Ocean Project page, add your domain. This will populate the NS records and give you your name severs. This is more than likely going to be <code>ns1.digitalocean.com.</code>, <code>ns2.digitalocean.com.</code> and <code>ns3.digitalocean.com.</code> – add these to your domain settings.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot-2020-01-21-at-10.28.45-copy-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/884cf8140a.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020 01 21 at 10 28 45 copy 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"384\" border=\"0\" />Also add in an A record in Digital Ocean, with a host name of <code>@</code> and direct it to your IP address of the droplet. It is vitally important you wait for all changes to propagate before continuing otherwise you may have issues with setting up Ghost. I would advise you to wait 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Once you are happy the domain information has properly propagated, continue to setting up the blog.<br /><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"pasted-image-0-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/28616a5c60.jpg\" alt=\"Pasted image 0 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"247\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h3>SSH Into Your Droplet</h3>\n<p>Nothing will be live until you SSH into your droplet and set up Ghost. You should see a page telling you as mush if your domain has propagated correctly. Open your terminal and type in:<br /><code>ssh root@your-ip-address</code></p>\n<p>The sever will ask for your password, copy and paste this in, and then immediately make you change it. You will need to put your current one in again, and then choose a new one – Keep this safe!</p>\n<p>Once this is done Ghost will download updates and set itself up. Press Enter.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"pasted-image-0-2-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/54a20989c1.jpg\" alt=\"Pasted image 0 2 1\" width=\"598\" height=\"149\" border=\"0\" /><br />You won’t need to put in any details about SQL databases or directories, you <em>will</em> have to put in your blog URL. Do this with the <code>https://</code> on and Ghost will set up your Let Encrypt certificate for you. This is where the installation will fall down if your domain is not properly propagated.</p>\n<p>Ghost will be installed and set up at <code>/var/www/ghost</code></p>\n<p>If everything goes ok, you will be given a url of <em>https://your-url/ghost</em>. Head to this address and set up your profile and blog title.

				"title": "Migrating From Wordpress To Ghost",
				"content_html": "<p>I’m going to be completely honest, this wasn’t easy for me – it was supposed to be straight forward, but everything that could have gone wrong did. I took the inspiration from <a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/the-biggest-change-to-birchtree-in-5-years/\">Matt Birchler</a> to post about my migration and the issues I faced in the hope someone else won’t run into the same.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exporting-from-wordpress\"><strong>Exporting From WordPress</strong></h2>\n<p>The easiest way to do this is through the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ghost/\">Ghost export plugin</a>. The plugin promises to download all of your posts, pages, and information into an easy to import ZIP file. Unfortunately, I haven’t met anyone yet that this has worked correctly.</p>\n<p>In preparation, you will need to think about the categories you have on your blog. Ghost works on tags and not categories, so this information needs to be transferred before you export. Use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpcat2tag-importer/\">Categories to Tags converter</a> plugin and run this once before export.</p>\n<p>Also if you are a lone blogger, make sure your user account has the same email address as the one used on WordPress. If they are different the import will set up another User account that is locked. Deleting this user also deletes all of the posts, and short of transferring each post over individually, you are a bit stuck.</p>\n<p>I had to switch to using the JSON option as the exporter kept timing out, even when I increased the memory available and also the time limit to infinite. This JSON file will only give you post and page content, not images to go along with it.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" title=\"imports-and-exports-in-Ghost-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3ad9506b40.jpg\" alt=\"Imports and exports in Ghost 1\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"importing-to-ghost\"><strong>Importing To Ghost</strong></h2>\n<p>Once you’ve set up your blog on Ghost, log into the dashboard, go to Labs &gt; Import content &gt; Choose your file. The process is swift, and at the end, all of your posts and pages will be live on your site. If you’ve managed to export a zip file, you have nothing more to do other than check through your posts and make sure you are happy with them.</p>\n<p>Due to my issues, I had the job of downloading all of my images from 7 years of posts and combing through each post to put them in. I tried to import all of my images into the recommended <code>content/images</code> folder; however, I used this opportunity to tidy up the folder.</p>\n<p>There is no reason a bulk import of images wouldn’t work providing you keep the same structure as your WordPress blog. However, bear in mind that WordPress stores multiple versions of the same image at different sizes so your images folder is going to be overinflated – if storage space is an issue for you then consider doing some work to tidy up beforehand.</p>\n<p>Now all I had to work about is a theme, and setting up my <a href=\"https://gr36.com/how-to-set-up-ghost-link-posts-using-canonical-url/\">link posts</a>!</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" title=\"Blog-screenshot-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/40f2b21bb6.jpg\" alt=\"Blog screenshot 1\" /></figure>\n<h2 id=\"improvements\"><strong>Improvements</strong></h2>\n<p>If I did this again, I would work a little more on editing the JSON to my liking and making everything run a little smoother. More information on doing your import can be found on the <a href=\"https://ghost.org/docs/api/v3/migration/\">Ghost site.</a>  My move was time sensitive as my hosting was coming to an end, but given more time, I would work on a testing domain with Ghost and spend more time on the import and set up.</p>\n<p>Exporting and importing from hosting platforms needs to become more uniform. Manton Reece, the creator of micro.blog, has called for an <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2017/11/24/blog-archive-format.html\">implemented standard</a> to make things much more comfortable to move around. It is times like this when you wish something existed. Many applications spend time working on importing from other options, so perhaps it’s time this becomes a consideration to those that run blogging platforms.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I am sure you don’t need me to tell you how good the AirPods are when compared to more or less anything else on the market. Since the original version hit the market, I’ve had a pair in my ears at some point in the day 80% of the time. They have worked out with me, walked miles with me and I’ve listen to hours upon hours of podcasts. I held off a little, but the new Pro version is a huge improvement – here are some tips and tricks I have picked up so far.</p>\n<h2><strong>No Tappy Tappy</strong></h2>\n<p>The new AirPods Pro feature buttons instead of an accelerometer that detects your taps. Of course the set up process guides you through new options for media controls but if you don’t pay attention fully it can be hard to work out what’s going on. Think of the button press as a squeeze of the microphone stem, you will feel a small click and an audio response if long pressing. It takes a bit of getting used to if you’ve used the original AirPods, but pretty easy to get used to.</p>\n<p>• Single-press: Pause/play<br />\n• Double-press: Skip forward<br />\n• Triple-press: Skip backward<br />\n• Long-press: Switch between noise cancellation and transparency mode.</p>\n<h2><strong>Change Noise Cancelling Settings</strong></h2>\n<p>The new AirPods pro feature active noice cancelling (ANC) with rubber tips to make a better seal in your ears. ANC can feel a bit strange at times and also shouldn’t be used every situation. Luckily there is a pretty neat ‘transparency’ mode which lets some noice from the outside world through, and also a toggle off.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto\" title=\"Airpod-Pro-Screenshots-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/260065dc1c.jpg\" alt=\"Airpod Pro Screenshots 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"477\" border=\"0\" />Unless you have changed any of the settings, by pressing and holding on either the left or right AirPod button will cycle you AirPods through ANC on or off. The change the options, head into the Bluetooth setting when your AirPods are connected. You will see options for both the left and right AirPods button, you can then add in whatever options you wish to cycle through.</p>\n<h2><strong>Activating Siri</strong></h2>\n<p>We all love shouting “Hey Siri” during a workout or walking down the street, but if you want to set up activating Siri with a press instead of a voice a voice it’s really easy. Head into the Bluetooth settings as above, there is then a range of options for the left and right AirPod button. I have set this up for left to be noise cancelling and right to be Siri.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s that time of the year again; the weather takes a turn for the worst and people (usually Americans) start moaning about having to shovel snow. These types of posts could be a little tongue in cheek, and I have no doubt you are excerpting yourself, but you don’t need a workout type. Some need adding to the Apple Watch such as sport types and training methods, which are slowly being increased- what it doesn’t need is ‘Yardwork’, ‘snow shovelling’ or rocking your baby.</p>\n<p>Thankfully the Apple Watch team has now found its market. Instead of a spray and pray device that does everything, its aim is notifications and Heath. Motioning all your workouts and keeping you more engaged with people. Workouts and activity don’t need to be overly complicated by every single time you exert yourself by doing daily tasks. There is a risk of adding too much and again making the Apple Watch too cluttered and too complicated.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto\" title=\"apple-watch-workouts-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5ec7f7796e.jpg\" alt=\"Apple watch workouts 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"399\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>These types of general are covered regardless of if you start a workout or not. It will detect your heart rate and movement increases and give you relevant move points. You’re exerting yourself so the activity ring will start to climb accordingly. If you’re dead set on recording it as a workout, start the ‘other’ one and then give it a name at the end if you’re ever going to review it. You’ll be forgiven to forget that there is another option because more often than not, it is hidden down at the bottom of your activity options.</p>\n<p>You get the same activity credit as a brisk walk, which is around 60 calories per 15 mins. Which is pretty low if you are working hard, so your best bet will be to let your Apple Watch detect how hard you are working and adjust accordingly. You will move your red and yellow rings regardless of you paying attention to them or not – that’s the great thing about Apple Watch.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"title": "How I Use Agenda",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Agenda-featured.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ce935fbf77.jpg\" alt=\"Agenda featured\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" />For the last few weeks, I have been throwing my life into Agenda, I’ve played around with it previously, but this time it seems to have stuck. I’m one of those people that like to try out an app or service just because people are using it, and this is what I did in 2018 when Agenda won the apple design award. I think I had signed up previously to use it on Mac but didn’t hang around very long.</p>\n<p>The only issue is this is a completely different approach to note taking. It ditches the somewhat traditional approach of a list of notes, in folders and turns it on its head. Everything is based around your calendar and dates. You can of course make notes without this, but its main power stems from tying into events in your life. For years I have been living out of my calendar and task management app (or apps), and I’ve been searching for a service that does it all for me. I feel like I have tried everything, from <a href=\"https://gr36.com/todoist-my-new-app-to-get-things-done/\">Todoist</a> to <a href=\"https://gr36.com/using-notion-web-clipper/\">Notion</a>, to more recently <a href=\"https://gr36.com/using-apple-notes-to-write-in-2019/\">Apple Notes</a>. My life is split into to distinct area and Agenda is already benefiting me in both.</p>\n<h2><strong><strong>Work</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>I am a development and engagement manager for a UK based insurance company. In essence, this entails a massive balancing act involving loads of meeting, emails and tasks to be completed. I work from an iMac at my desk, an iPad in conferences and an iPhone at every other time, so having a cross-platform app with great sync is required.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"agenda-usage-iphone-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4a85328499.jpg\" alt=\"Agenda usage iphone 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"477\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h3><strong><strong>Meetings</strong></strong></h3>\n<p>These are exchange meetings set up in Outlook, the only thing that stops me using Agenda for calendar management is the missing option to add invitees. This is not a massive issue for me, as I’m in Outlook for email anyway. From these events, I create all of my meeting preparation in Agenda, including all my written notes, clipped images some times also documents.</p>\n<p>The benefit of being able to add in documents that I can refer too quickly in meetings is a godsend. The fact I don’t need to go into a room armed with loads of paperwork any more is a huge benefit. I also won’t lose any following it; if anything is handed to me, I can insert a scan of the document using my phone with a single click.</p>\n<p>Granted this looks a little weird depending on who your meeting is with, thankfully my sessions are usually in tech or design people, and everyone else has just gotten used to my weirdness. Mainly because I can email a meeting review, including all documents, or print out a version within minutes of leaving the room. Exporting from Agenda is a massive benefit over something like Evernote or Apple Notes; it is powerful and flexible to fit into most situations.</p>\n<p><br /><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"text-align: center;\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8335452151565777\" data-ad-slot=\"5524743860\"></ins></p>\n<p>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</p>\n<h3><strong><strong>Collecting Info</strong></strong></h3>\n<p>The second part of my job is producing content through various channels. For this, I have a section for work ‘in progress’ and create a project for putting things together. Mainly containing video scripts and outlines for blog posts, but some other random info I want to store. As much as Agenda is date focused, it works <em><em>ok</em></em> with saving some general info, but shouldn’t be seen as a note app replacement if you need to store loads of info. Because Agenda is date focused, I can collect all this together and make reminders right up to the ‘due date’.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot-2019-11-20-at-17.53.44-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/71dbd552b3.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019 11 20 at 17 53 44 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong><strong>Home</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>The second part of my life revolves around my family. I am the parent of two children, one of whom is disabled, so date focused note-taking is more or less a given. Our calendar is filled full of hospital appointments, school events and other things that I need information on.</p>\n<h3><strong><strong>Hospitals</strong></strong></h3>\n<p>My agenda home section has a general project for my daughter’s hospital appointments, filled full of notes that refer to older appointments. No longer am I searching for information, or trying to remember what we discussed at the last appointment. Much like my work meetings, if I need to scan a medication label, or snap a picture of recommended equipment, I can put it right into the Agenda note. I also like to send my wife and parents a text with the notes in, which Agenda lets me do with a couple of taps.</p>\n<h3><strong><strong>Technology</strong></strong></h3>\n<p>I love writing and talking about technology, I’ve tried for more than seven years to stop, but something about it gets me excited. I take notes for upcoming episodes of my podcast, <a href=\"https://byodpodcast.com/\">Bring Your Own Device</a>, linked to the calendar event I share with my co-host. I would love to have collaboration, this would cut out our show notes Apple Note, but these notes are for my talking points only.</p>\n<p>I also outline and write every blog post I publish in an Agenda Note. Taking the same form as with my work life, what I love is that I can drag in images and text from other sources as reference.</p>\n<p><br /><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"text-align: center;\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-8335452151565777\" data-ad-slot=\"5524743860\"></ins></p>\n<p>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</p>\n<h3><strong><strong>Features I would Like</strong></strong></h3>\n<p>There aren’t many features that I feel are missing from Agenda, and I would be concerned if they tried to add in too much. Agenda is not a publishing platform, and in many ways isn’t a note-taking app. However, each feature is thought out so it can be adapted to many use cases. There are a couple I have mentioned already, being able to create calendar events with invites; however, I don’t even know if this is possible due to the many different calendars available. Collaboration would also be perfect, and in which case this may even become an option for teams, but just being able to write some show notes for my podcast would be great.</p>\n<p>I would also like to see a focus mode, where I can write in one note. At the moment I am writing in a note that is inside the today view, or on the Agenda. It would be great to be able to open a note and no other information. With all this said, the app is pretty perfect for mine, and many other peoples use case, all the features implemented are well thought out, and the developer support is brilliant. I’m an active member of the Agenda community, so you can always come say hi!</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>It’s been a long time coming, but with the reproduction of colour into the iPhone line up with the XR, Apple released a clear case. The case has also appeared with the new phone line ups, available for the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro thanks to new colours in the lineup. Now I need to be straight to the point on this – Do Not Buy One.</p>\n<p>You might be tempted to pick one up, show off that brand new Midnight-Green iPhone 11 Pro, or cool Yellow iPhone 11. If you choose to buy one in-store, you might even be pitched one to compliment your shiny new purchase, because you should show off the colour of them, the midnight green is my personal favourite, but at £45 you really shouldn’t.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"DSC0004-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/00d8675519.jpg\" alt=\"DSC0004 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The Apple cases are a bit like marmite, I love them because they fit and last the best I have found, but many people think they are a rip-off. Which is understandable given that most other cases are less than half the price of the stock options, but they do offer something different. The leather cases I have used last well and feel premium quality, whereas the silicone version provides a much more grippy surface. However, they charge what seems like more and more each year for the privilege.</p>\n<p>The clear case feels like every other clear case on the market. The materials used are a little more robust than other clear cases, and the fit is perfect (as all ways with Apple cases). Some cheaper options are often flimsy and imperfect fitting but are a minute price when compared the Apple. What it doesn’t avoid is the same old issues that plague all clear cases – weird smudge marks and pocket lint build up.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"DSC0005-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9dd7051939.jpg\" alt=\"DSC0005 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>To be fair almost every case in the world suffers from lint build-up, but because the case is clear, it is much more apparent. You might like showing everyone the lovely colour of your phone, but you’re also showing them you didn’t clean your phone in the last hour. When the phone is this good at avoiding fingerprints and smudges, its annoying the case isn’t – but no case can be.</p>\n<p>If you are ogling to get a clear case, please don’t go for the Apple one. I made a mistake a purchased it along with a few other things and didn’t realise how expensive it is. Opt for a middle of the road option; there are plenty to choose from and save yourself some cash.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "Powerbeats Pro Review",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"powerbeats-pro-featured.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/53b47a4042.jpg\" alt=\"Powerbeats pro featured\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>My biggest problem with headphones is that I have too many of them. Gone are the days of having one pair to last you years on end, If you can avoid the removal of your headphone jack you might last a while, but the reliance on Bluetooth brings better models ever to the market. Now owned by Apple, Beats are the masters of this, producing a never-ending stream of better models of each version of their headphones. The Powerbeats have seen little improvement other than the introduction on the W1 chip since launching in 2013. Six years later sees the most significant update to the line ever, incorporating a new Apple chip and making them truly wireless.</p>\n<p>The Powerbeats Pro builds on the technology, and hopefully, the success of Apple own AirPods. Incorporating the security, convenience and power saving of the new H1 chip (signifier changed from W to H). Something that no other manufacturer has access to, nor has been able to complete with fully as yet.</p>\n<p>The claim from Beats is that the Powerbeats are the most popular fitness headphone in the world. A bold claim, and arguably hard to prove – take a look next time you’re at the gym or out for a run, and you don’t see many of them. However, I am a massive fan, owning all versions to date.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"powerbeats-pro-phone-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6994ba177b.jpg\" alt=\"Powerbeats pro phone 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Usability</strong></h2>\n<p>Upon unboxing the Powerbeats Pro, the surprisingly high build quality is evident. Often criticised for their use of plastic Beats haven’t changed their ways much, but the surface feels premium and worth the price tag. These are of course more than £200, and for that money you get almost double the battery, all be it in a comically large carry case.</p>\n<p>Simply opening the case allows for quick paring to iOS and macOS devices, and once completed, the connection will sync to all your iCloud devices. Of course, you’ve heard all this before; we saw this on both generations of AirPods and older Beats headphones.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"powerbeats-pro-case-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f125da3d8e.jpg\" alt=\"Powerbeats pro case 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Where Powerbeats Pro stand out is usability that suits the fitnesses market perfectly. They seal well in the ear, and the ear hooks mean that you won’t have any issues with them moving around during even the most rigorous of exercise. If you’ve ever tried to run with wired headphones, you will know how freeing it is to have nothing flapping around or pulling on your ears. This new wave of genuinely wireless headphone is revolutionary to those that have spent many years having to run a cable down your top. Once you use these, you won’t be going back any time soon, and this alone is worth the price tag.</p>\n<p>Sweat resistance is stated by Beats but only for the earbuds themselves. So don’t get caught in any downpours or spill anything on the case – this <em><em>is</em></em>surprising given how robustly they are made. Everything is all sealed off from the elements leaving just charging pins and buttons exposed. You read that right, not a touch interface or reliance on voice commands insight. Tactile buttons the same on each ear to change the volume and play/pause. You can also hold the centre <em><em>B</em></em> button down to activate Siri if you wish – but don’t forget with the W1 brings with it Hey Siri support.</p>\n<p>She will hear you loud and clear for all your voice commands, but obviously, you’ll need a data connection to do this. I’ve been running phone free with a connection to my Apple Watch and even letting Siri read my incoming messages out for me. The microphone is surprisingly clear for the few calls I have taken on them while working out, but no reassurance that I was running was needed. It’s obvious you are on hands-free, but not distracting to the person you’re talking to, they are leaps and bounds ahead of the already pretty good Powerbeats3.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"powerbeats-pro-buds-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/38a5fd5edb.jpg\" alt=\"Powerbeats pro buds 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Sound</strong></h2>\n<p>I want to say that these are the only headphones you will ever need, but if your ear is tuned to listen to the very best cans, you are going to have to compromise. They are never going to win any awards for sound quality given that most of the time in use you are moving around somewhat energetically. The sound is much improved over previous versions, with a tremendous dynamic range with a slight emphasis on bass.</p>\n<p>They are a delight to listen to music and spoken word such as podcasts. Some downplay the sound of all Beats headphones, but the Powerbeats more than any other, I would argue they don’t need to sound perfect. However, the Powerbeats sound better than acceptable, much better than the previous version.</p>\n<p>What I particularly like is that some sound from outside gets through despite the useful sealing tips. I’m not a fan of completely isolating headphones when exercising, being able to hear traffic and people around you is a must. The Powerbeats Pro also pause your music when you take one out your ear, which comes in especially useful when telling someone to re-rack their weights.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>This all detracts from the fact that these could, and should, be considered more than just workout headphones. They deserve much more than to be thrown into your gym bag or only used occasionally, they are real AirPod competitors. Both the sound and fit are much better than Apples own version, but they give up a little ground on the overall design.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t ever see myself replacing my Airpods with these, but I won’t be wearing anything else for activities. I can’t state enough how much of a revelation running with no wires is. I have ears that won’t keep Airpods or indeed any other earbuds in, so Powerbeats are almost my only option. It’s rare I would recommend an upgrade on headphones even if you have the last version – but for everyone on the fence – you need these in your life.</p>\n<p>The Beats PowerBeats Pro come in black, white, navy or green, costing <a href=\"https://amzn.to/31MMMLa\">£219.95</a>.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

This is times one hundred when looking for somewhere to eat, drink, or anything really, users need to know what this place is actually like. Downloading another app to do this just isn’t going to cut it.</p>\n<p>There is also a massive disparity between review based on your country. The US still relies heavily on Yelp, while the UK leans on Trip Advisor, so it’s more challenging knowing where the data is coming from and how reliable it is. Apple must control this from start to finish (as they so love to do) and aid its users more by allowing all its customer base to review every point of interest in Apple Maps quickly. Offering a simple incentive to begin with when users upload pictures and reviews, similar to Google Local Guides, give Apple a tremendous kick-start and opens map reviews up to over a billion users.</p>\n<p>Pulling this in from other places is one thing, but if you’ve ever known the pain of waiting for ordinance survey or any traditional service to even mark a new street on the maps is a horrible experience. All of a sudden you have a billion people updating and making the whole world for you.</p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5136\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9fb7a8ade0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"921\" />Against</h2>\n<p>This is yet another thing for Apple to delve into and manage. With increasing criticism surrounding their foray into services and subscriptions, Apple is doomed if they do and damned if they don’t. Their insistence on controlling every aspect of their hardware and software from start to finish means that they often neglect users needs and also software stability.</p>\n<p>Regardless of being managed by different teams, if attention is taken away from more critical areas, then a move into map reviews seems pointless. Google already found out the hardware that maintaining user-generated map changes and improvements can become untenable, and arguably the only reason them support maps is to sell adverts to companies. A business model that no longer interests Apple.</p>\n<p>Pulling in data from <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/apple-maps-adds-new-review-sources-replacing-yelp-outside-us-in-many-cases-218020\">Trip Advisor</a> and services like <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/54.910/-3.432\">OpenStreetMap</a> is the easiest way to gain masses of data with minimal investment or development. Policing reviews is a complicated process, one that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/scammers-edit-google-maps-bank-listings-fraud-2018-11\">Google has pulled back from</a>, so opening maps data up is not without its downsides. Do the server-side costs, review work and the general hassle make it worthwhile?</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"title": "Mjyun True Wireless Earphones Review",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>So, here’s the thing. I receive loads of emails from random PR companies to test products, not as many as real tech reviewers, but enough. They claim to give you free products, but actually want you to pay for them first. I’ve been burnt a few times so typically decline. However I was intrigued to try some AirPods alternatives and I wish I hadn’t bothered.</p>\n<p>That isn’t to say there aren’t earbuds out there that can live up to the functionality of Apples foray into true wireless. It is simply the fact that I see so many claim that they are alternatives when in reality they are not even comparable. These Miyun versions are no exception, and no hidden gem.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2018-06-22-mjyun-wireless-case-1.jpeg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/32d7980365.jpg\" alt=\"2018 06 22 mjyun wireless case 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Indeed they are a fraction of the price, because frankly there is no getting around the fact that many of the new breed of truly wireless earbuds are eye wateringly expensive. I didn’t expect them to be equal, but in true B movie style, I expected them to at least be somewhere near.</p>\n<p>They come in a nice, robust case, offering a neat charging solution with supplied micro USB cable. The build quality feels surprisingly robust to a level that I am frankly astonished at. With that said, Apple resort to using a <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Device/AirPods\">ridiculous amount of glue</a>, so I would expect these to be no different, an illusion of quality if you will.</p>\n<h2><strong><strong>Sound</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>As with all earphones this is the proof of everything, the reason you by them, but it’s difficult to know where to start. The sound quality is terrible and there is no getting around it. Due to the strange twist you do when putting the earbuds in your ears the seal seems to be pretty good and cuts out lots of background noise. Unfortunately they haven’t taken advantage of this and everything sounds very shallow and distant.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2018-06-22-mjyun-wireless-blackberry-1.jpeg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/55a2674486.jpg\" alt=\"2018 06 22 mjyun wireless blackberry 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The bass levels are non existent and everything else seems to be forced into a much higher range than it should be. Spoken word such as podcasts and audio books are the most noticeable and make all voices sound tinny and sometimes uncomfortably high pitched.</p>\n<p>Couple this with the fact that audio moves around from ear to ear and you have a very disappointing experience. I realise that these are very very cheap for true wireless earphones, but I would save your money and purchase something better sounding with wires!</p>\n<h2><strong><strong>Connection Issues</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>The ease of initial connection is where most cheap wireless headphones fall down. Let’s not over inflate the issue, most users are ou fait with heading to your phones setting to set up and pair. Yet for some reason this is overly complicated with a dance of buttons and connecting you must jump through simply to listen. A successful connection is following a predetermined path of connecting to one earbud, and then the other connecting to it. Stray too far from this path and resetting is your only option, condemned to try again until the Bluetooth gods accept your offering.</p>\n<p>As annoying as snagging a cable is, if this is your alternative I think I would rather sit in silence. There are alternatives to AirPods out there, but these cheap offers are simply not it. I have <a href=\"https://www.coolsmartphone.com/2016/10/17/aukey-wireless-enough-going/\">bought and enjoyed cheap Bluetooth headphones before</a> with a wire between them, removing this has proved so overly complicated that it is simply not worth the hassle. Save up, or save your time – the choice is yours.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "iPad Pro Thoughts",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>Once upon a time I would ‘review’ all of my tech purchases, post several hundred if not thousand words of my thoughts and a dive into the device. For the last two models of iPad I have simply shared my thoughts through text and also <a href=\"https://byodpodcast.com/\">podcast</a>. There are enough reviews out there for you to find out the specs and technology publication opinions – but now more than ever its important to find out the thoughts of people that actually use the device in question. Well here are mine.</p>\n<p>All of the improvements Apple made to this years iPad Pro when looked at individually look quite trivial. They upgraded the internals and brought the design inline with their modern phones, removing the home button, and incorporating FaceID. Both of these things didn’t need an anylist to predict, but they have both lead to some major changes to actually using the iPad and improve almost everything about the experience. Did the change in design lead to the changes in Apple Pencil and Keyboard, or did they lead the design choices. While you argue about swings and roundabouts – I’ll tell you what’s improved and ultimately why that matters.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2018-11-09-iPad-pro-review-hero-1-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7377e48bc7.jpg\" alt=\"2018 11 09 iPad pro review hero 1 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Design</strong></h2>\n<p>The ‘edge to edge’ screen retains some bezel around the edges, which is the best of what could have been a bad situation. All the palm rejection in the world can’t mediate holding a device to read and touching the screen constantly. However the new squared off design actually makes it much easier to handle the device. It feels almost like science fiction and without doubt almost what every device manufacturer shoots for when trying to design a perfect tablet. It’s not quite a slab of glass, but its not far off.</p>\n<p>The new design is very reminiscent of an older iPhone 5 design, but with a modern feel. It also in some respects feels like a reference design for future products without hardware limitations. I am using the 11” version and it feels much larger than it actually is, a nice big screen which is still very portable and easy to also use as a consumption device.</p>\n<p>The smart connector has moved to the back of the device, presumably allowing for a more device ecosystem of accessories. Very few accessories appeared for the previous side mounted version, and unfortunately I don’t seem many flooding the market with this one. Hopefully I will be disappointed, but this does allow for a much better connection using a rediculous number of magnets and an improvement to the first party keyboard.</p>\n<h2><strong>Folio Keyboard</strong></h2>\n<p>I have loved and loathed the Smart Keyboard in <a href=\"/2018-11-17-ipad-smart-keyboard/\">equal amounts over the last two years</a>. The keyboard itself is great, I really enjoy typing on it, but the origami style always felt strange and the back of my iPad felt exposed. The Smart Folio solves both of these problems and I am really enjoying the improvements.</p>\n<p>If you hate the keys on the previous version, you’re going to feel the same about the new one. However to me the keys feel more robust and seem to have further travel – combined with much loader clicking!</p>\n<p>Using the iPad in the Smart Folio but without the keyboard feels very un-Apple like to me. For all its weirdness at least the origami needed for the Smart Keyboard hid away the keys when not in use, all be it at the expense of a strange hump on the front. The weirdness is mediated a little by how simple it is to remove the Smart Folio, and actually feel the device as Apple intended. I find myself pooping the iPad Pro out of the case when using the pencil or just browsing more than I expected.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2018-11-10-writing-pencil-1.jpeg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/879a8d56f2.jpg\" alt=\"2018 11 10 writing pencil 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"399\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>New Apple Pencil</strong></h2>\n<p>Apples stylus (don’t call it a stylus) is a great tool to have in my professional life, but not something I would considering buying for personal use. The first version was something I purchased and found a use for, and spent most of its time hiding in my bag for the odd time I would need to sign something. It was too long, didn’t really fit anywhere to store it and you felt silly charging it.</p>\n<p>The second version mediates almost all of those issues, except the use case. Unless you’re going to draw quite often the £130 price tag will make most people baulk – the £30 price increase adds in quite a few features but wont work with any other hardware at this moment in time.</p>\n<p>The second generation is shorter, more balanced and flat on one side. Making it more pencil like, and also allowing it to stick to the side of the iPad and wirelessly charge. Not only removing the need to look like a idiot every time you charge the thing, but also giving it a place to be stored and removing the anxiety enduceing end cap.</p>\n<h2><strong>USB-C</strong></h2>\n<p>The move away from Lightning hasn’t added any extra features to the iPad, but has made them more accessible and dare I say it interesting. It is slightly strange to find the port isn’t a Thunderbolt 3 variant, but is still capable of supporting an external display up to 5k.</p>\n<p>Having tested several apps it is clear nothing extra stands out but it has allowed me to use my already amassed selection of USB-C cables from my MacBook Pro. Cheaper option for USB-C to HDMI and also dongles mean the dream of not carrying a laptop at all are getting a whole lot closer.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>The 2018 iPad has proved to be a worthy upgrade <em><em>for me</em></em>, it has improved on lots of little things that while weren’t detrimental, they where annoying.</p>\n<p>With that said Apples recent trend of increasing the price and providing less equipment in the box is getting close to putting me off. All of the iPad’s have increased in price, there is no headphone dongle, no spare Apple Pencil tips and nothing to say Apple wont continue this trend. If asked what iPad should I buy, I would give most users the choice between the £329 iPad and the much cheaper 10.5” iPad pro.</p>\n<p>As good as it is, and it really is good, I view this iPad as even a notch above pro. It is the early adopter or hardcore users iPad, not the one for everyone.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "GoodTask 3 - Supercharge Apple Reminders",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>For longer than I care to remember, or admit to, I have been searching for the perfect task manager. I am definitely not alone in the feeling that there wasn’t a service that seemed to fit. <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2017-01-14-todoist-review/\">Todoist</a> almost got there, Things 3 is pretty good, but no service ticked all the boxes and I went backwards and forwards between them more than a handful of times. Thankfully I think I’ve cracked it, and it’s an add on service for the stock reminders app – I think Goodtasks3 is the perfect solution.</p>\n<p>For almost as long as I’ve been switching task manager apps, Apple’s reminders app has been in desperate need of an overhaul. Everyone admits it, yet it still has a completely different UI to every other app and hasn’t received the level of attention given to Notes or Music. Frankly it isn’t a very good iOS citizen either. Countless third party apps put it to shame, offering a much better service, miles better design and huge improvements in user experience.</p>\n<p>Although what Apple reminders lacks in appeal it makes it for in utility, it’s ingrained in almost every part of iOS and allows for much better task input. It just need some so called ‘power user’ options and easer task input. This is where GoodTask 3 comes in. Once granted access to your stock reminders it can be used to sort, display, set up and complete tasks alongside Apple’s own app.</p>\n<h2><strong><strong>Smart Lists</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>One of my favourite functions are smart lists, allowing for filtering into different options based on numerous filters either individually or combined. For example I have set up smart lists to mimick my typical Todoist home screen, with an Inbox, Today overview and others based on reminder topic – Work, Home etc.</p>\n<p>GoodTask achieves this by putting text in the title or notes of each reminder. A hashtag or keyword in the task notes doesn’t clog up lists if you choose to also use the Apple app, but allows for much more flexibility in task types. Separating work and home, short and long term goals, whatever you are trying to achieve. Because of how easy task input is I have achieved much more in the last few months.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2018-11-09-goodtasks3-screenshots-1-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b152a8bfb5.jpg\" alt=\"2018 11 09 goodtasks3 screenshots 1 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"478\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong><strong>Task Input</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Inputting tasks becomes much easier with quick actions and contextual awareness. This is something really lacking from even advanced task managers like Things 3. Once you have experienced the natural input of Todoist it is really hard to go elsewhere. Tap the plus icon in GoodTask and you can use almost all of the same options. By default it will pick out reminder titles, alert requests and also due dates. Although just bare in mind you will need to delve into settings if you don’t use American date structures.</p>\n<p>This is also where quick actions come in, these give the ability to tap on predefined options for task labels, alert options and also adding to shared lists. These can be customised until your heart is content and make GoodTask infinitely more powerful the more work you put in.</p>\n<p>All of these options are great, but the real beauty of adopting GoodTask is the fact that all the other options for inputting regular reminders are also open to you. Use Siri on any device and simply ask it to remind you. No keywords, no Shortcuts, no awkward phrasing and nothing to worry about. Tasks will show in the stock app and also GoodTask 3, where you can add in extra details and labelling.</p>\n<p>I have adopted a <a href=\"http://rocketpanda.net/2018/10/gtd-series-intro/\">GTD approach</a> and set up an Inbox smart list where every reminder without a due date, or tag ends up. Allowing me to brain dump everything I wish to do, and worry about when and how later on. GoodTask 3 will allow you to get many of the power user features with all of the benefits of a first party app and it is highly recommended.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>This isn’t the right thing to say but I dread taking my daughters wheelchair anywhere new. Most places are great but I can’t escape the feeling of dread because it only takes one poor experience to put you off completely – thankfully London was pretty great.</p>\n<h2><strong>Train To London</strong></h2>\n<p>After having an awful time when traveling to Nottingham with a mobility scooter I wasn’t holding up much hope. However from arriving on the platform to getting off the other end the experience was great. We were apparently supposed to book disabled access, however this isn’t very prominent when booking tickets – because there wasn’t any space we managed to get a free upgrade to first class. Obviously this wont happen to everyone, but the staff we spoke to seemed to genuinely care about getting us the best service possible.</p>\n<h2><strong>London Underground</strong></h2>\n<p>Let it never be said that the underground doesn’t have good disabled access, because all things considered it does. Some stations are easier than others (we tested quite a few considering the circle line was shut) but look out for the blue disabled badges as they are strep free to street level. Also be prepared to take multiple lifts, and have to hunt around for them. We used a grand total of 21 lefts during our day in London, some better signed than others and we did plenty of pushing in between.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto\" title=\"tour_img-1959392-99-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ed65c81b63.jpg\" alt=\"Tour img 1959392 99 1\" width=\"1585\" height=\"792\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>London Eye</strong></h2>\n<p>It was from here onwards we really started to see the people that really cared about our experience. There is a stark difference between those that put in accessibility equipment for regulation and those that really care about allowing access for everyone. Staff at the London Eye went out of their way to get us through as easy as possible, they stop the wheel for everyone with issues getting on, and will place and ramp for those in a chair.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say the experience went without a hiccup, getting into the cordoned off line was a nightmare, with people punching in from all angles and people clearly didn’t care about the wheelchair. This wasn’t the staffs fault, but be prepared to be a little assertive and you’ll get on great.</p>\n<h2><strong>London Aquarium</strong></h2>\n<p>The staff and facility here is another shining example of really caring about access to all mobility issues. There are numerous lifts to navigate the floors of the aquarium, and plentiful disabled toilets throughout the journey. There are some sticky places, particularly the ‘Amazon’ section, where the floor is made to look as if walking in the rainforest, this is a harder to push through but not impossible.</p>\n<p>All of the tanks are easy to see when you’re down a little lower, but be prepared to wait at the larger tanks to get towards then front. If possible I would allow extra time and aim for quieter times in order to see everything. At hands on areas, staff were set up to transfer a star fish into a container so Lucie could have a feel sat in her chair.</p>\n<p>Only once were the words “never again” muttered, when trying to work our way though the maze of lifts in Kings Cross. However all said everywhere provided great access and we had a great experience. Disabled access is experiencing a sea change at the minute and I am excited to see everywhere become easy to access for us.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"title": "Jisoncase iPhone X Leather Case Review",
				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>As much as people try and convince me otherwise, since the iPhone 6 I just cant use my phone without a case on. The rounded corners and slippery materials leave me with too much worry that my phone will drop to the floor at any moment. I’ve tried loads of cases, from dirt cheap to surprisingly expensive – but stuck with an Apple version as it simply fit and feels the best. This isn’t <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2017-12-29-lopie-sea-island-review/\">set in stone though</a> so when Jisoncase offered to send me their leather case for my iPhone X I jumped at the chance.</p>\n<p>I opted for the saddle brown version to <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2018-06-21-Jisoncase-ipadpro-review/\">compliment my iPad case</a>, and they both arrived in packaging that didn’t befit something so reasonably priced. Unlike the £50 Apple leather cases that supliments the £1000 you paid for the phone, the Jisoncase version is priced at just £19.95. At a price point comparative to a middle of the road silicone case, this one feels like you paid much more.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto\" title=\"2018-06-22-jisoncase-iPhonex-side-1.jpeg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/64ca66ba48.jpg\" alt=\"2018 06 22 jisoncase iPhonex side 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The leather is complimented by hard inlays for the volume and power buttons. It’s hard to say if this is metal or plastic but they fit very well and give a reassuring click when used. Tactile feedback is something I didn’t expect, most others in this price range often neglect the buttons. Leaving users to experience mushy button mashes that you’re not entirely sure if it worked or not.</p>\n<p>The quality of leather has also been surprising high. Admittedly it doesn’t feel as soft and supple as that adorning high priced cases, but it has worn very well in the few weeks I have been using it. I do think that leather cases look much better with a little wear on them, but a quick wipe with a cloth to take these review pictures and it looks good as new again!</p>\n<p>My only criticism would be the logo across the back. This could be personal preference here, but I’m not entirely happy having Jisoncase across the back of my phone. A subtle Apple it is not, more like a tramp stamp across the rear of a very expensive purchase. This is of course a minor issue given the quality of the case for a very reasonable price. The case is available in saddle brown as pictured above, but also black, blue and red. For the a fraction of the price of an Apple case, this is a bargain – grab one from <a href=\"http://www.jisoncase.com/iphone-x-genuine-leather-slim-case-ipx05a_p0059.html\">Jisoncase website</a>, <a href=\"https://de.aliexpress.com/store/product/Jisoncase-Leather-Case-for-iPhone-X-Case-Cover-Genuine-Leather-Luxury-Brand-Slim-Anti-knock-Back/339855_32834930108.html?spm=a2g0x.12010612.0.0.2d973e5dvBNQLV\">Aliexpress</a> or <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2usrzY5\">Amazon</a></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"title": "Jisoncase iPad Pro Case Review",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>For as long as I have been using an iPad as my main computer I have struggled with where to keep it. I have never been a fan of many case designs as they often add a lot of weight which makes holding an iPad much more difficult. Couple this with the fact a case is pretty much redundant while in use, it’s usually in my hand or being used propped up in the Smart Keyboard, there simply hasn’t been anything to fill the void.</p>\n<p>So when Apple introduced leather sleeves with the 10.5 inch iPad Pro I was interested to see if they would work – but at £130 it was far to much money to simply test one out. Thankfully as with everything made over the last few years, it has been reproduced at a much more acceptable price point – introducing the Jisoncase iPad Pro Case. All the features, but at a considerable saving and I’ve been trying one out for a couple of weeks – here is my review.</p>\n<h2><strong><strong>Design And Usage</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>The case fits the iPad Pro and pencil snuggly inside, it is reassuringly fitted to the design and offers pretty good protection from everything other than a very high drop. It pretty much copies the official Apple design with real brown leather that is lined with soft material on the inside. Meaning not only is your iPad going to be protected, it’s going to be dusted off while inside the case and more importantly you’re going to look good carying it.</p>\n<p>The cover is also available in black or red, but I opted for the brown colour to match my other brown peripherals. The leather, although not as high quality as more expensive cases, appears to be wearing very well – although a bit of wear and tear makes a leather case look much better in my opinion. So I am actually looking forward to it appearance after a few months of use. I am much more comfortable putting my iPad into my bag knowing it has more a little more protection.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2018-06-21-jisoncase-desk2-1.jpeg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/577d572c14.jpg\" alt=\"2018 06 21 jisoncase desk2 1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I was initially very sceptical about using the case, and put off a little due to the sung fitting, but after a few days of use the case provided a great deal of protection given the amount of traveling I do. Thankfully there is also a slot to store an Apple Pencil, seeing as I have already lost two, this should hopefully make sure I know here it is and it is protected. Unfortunately it isn’t all good news because I cant use it with the Smart Keyboard.</p>\n<p>Unlike other cases there is absolutely no chance of fitting an iPad in with Smart Keyboard attached. I can just about wedge it in with enough effort, but this just isn’t practical. I presume the leather will stretch over time, but when compared to simpler cases on the market I really shouldn’t have to stop using the keyboard when I want to put it in a case. I considered getting an occasional keyboard, however as great at the case is, given my <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2017-02-19-one-year-ipad-computer/\">usage and the amount of work I do on my iPad</a> I can not justify making changes to my workflow just to use this case.</p>\n<h2><strong><strong>Conclusion</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>I am not really sure where this now fits in, I use the Jisoncase iPad Pro Case a small amount when at home, but without storage for my keyboard the usage when traveling has stopped. If you use just the iPad and Apple Pencil (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gr36/status/997016619477069826?s=21\">which according to my poll</a> quite a few people do) then this is the case for you. Great quality, nice looks and protection can be found at a bargain price point.</p>\n<p>You can buy the case on <a href=\"http://www.jisoncase.com/ipad-pro-leather-stand-bag-pro22m_p0061.html\">the Jisoncase Website</a> , <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jisoncase-Leather-Sleeve-Pencil-TC-PRO-23M20/dp/B0753FYWBW\">Amazon</a> or <a href=\"https://de.aliexpress.com/store/product/Luxury-Leather-Sleeve-Case-for-iPad-Pro-10-5-2017-Pouch-Bag-Folding-Cover-with-Pencil/339855_32833536134.html?spm=a2g0x.12010612.0.0.456419ceiyy44O\">Aliexpress</a>.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

This isn’t perfect but the best way is to use Bear to add files as attachments to Things.</p>\n<p>Bear has a great implementation of file attachments to notes, you can clip pretty much anything you wish. The app will then show file links inline, allowing for other notes and attachments to be placed as desired. Thanks to the developers love of URL schemes you can then link to the note from Things.

That is not to say I couldn’t do most of these things in other apps, but the automation seems much more approachable. It also helps that people like Federico at MacStories keep giving me inspiration for more Workflows.  <a href=\"https://workflow.is/workflows/8a204d55398b44a1b7df854b746227c6\">This Workflow</a> simplifies one shared with <a href=\"https://club.macstories.net/\">MacStories members</a>, and allows me to quickly add webpages that I want to read later, or ones I want to write about to Things.</p>\n<p>It takes Safari webpage links, finds the article title and webpage, prompts for a tag and due date, then puts all of that information into Things for you to look at later. The date can also be input in natural language as <a href=\"https://gr36.com/2018-03-03-natural-language-dates-in-things/\">discussed in an older post</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a1f2bca0b1.jpg\" alt=\"2018 03 04 things article screens 1\" title=\"2018-03-04-things-article-screens-1.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"1000\" height=\"498\" />All of the information is then crammed into a URL which might look complicated but is in fact surprisingly easy. Due to the automation features packed into Things 3.4 the URL will open in the Things app and add in your desired todo item. Including article title, website information and of course the URL as a note, so you can pick up where you left off.</p>\n<p>This simple Workflow is really easy to customise if you wish. I use one without a due date which can be deleted if you want to. You can also create a list in Things for all of these articles instead of adding a tag. Just change the long URL at the bottom to read <code>&amp;list=</code> instead of <code>&amp;tags=</code>.</p>\n<p>There is a whole list of possibilities that you could build into the URL scheme if you want to take a look what Things supports head over to their support page.

Grab it from the link above and put it to use, it’s as easy as pie.</p>\n<p>The first prompt will ask you for a title for your todo, the second will ask for any notes you wish to ask. Lastly there is a prompt for the date for the reminder. This can process regular dates and also the natural language you desire, convert this into the format Things needs and put it all into the app.</p>\n<p>You can customise this as much as you like with tags and projects.

Cases are another thing I am never happy with, always looking for the new thing that will keep my pride and joy safe.</p>\n<p>Finding the balance point between protecting your phone, but also not adding too much weight or bulk is a difficult choice. Whilst the <a href=\"/post/2017-11-08-iphonex-impressions/\">iPhone X is great</a> and gives me a nice big screen to use one handed, it is heavier than previous models, so adding the official case has bumped the weight up to almost the tipping point.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2017-12-28-Lopie-seaisland-inside-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/281238dd84.jpg\" alt=\"2017 12 28 Lopie seaisland inside 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>When my phone took a <a href=\"/post/2017-08-20-careful-with-my-phone/\">tumble earlier this year</a> it survived only because of the official leather case. Others would have provided it with similar protection, but it has made me so fearful of a similar accident with my £1000 purchase. I just <a href=\"/post/2017-11-04-few-hours-naked/\">can’t use it naked for very long</a>. So ever in search of something new I ordered the Lopie Sea Island Corton Series case and here is my quick review.</p>\n<p>The only reason I ordered this model is because the Verge adorning it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16744278/apple-iphone-x-leather-case\">the best leather case</a>, and for £15 I figured why not try it. I wasn’t quite banking on an estimated delivery of 20–25 days though! Thankfully it arrived after 20, well packaged and made of great quality materials. The Lopie Sea Island Corton Series case is covered by a combination of a tweed like material at the top and a leather at the bottom. My particular version is light brown.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2017-12-28-Lopie-seaisland-camera-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/42f5e7f477.jpg\" alt=\"2017 12 28 Lopie seaisland camera 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Case Pouch</strong></h2>\n<p>I’m not a fan of keeping bank cards, or any other type of card for that matter tucked in the back of my phone. Some people use their case as a faux wallet and store everything in there. However great this seems in practice, it can be extremely annoying when you want to actually use the phone.</p>\n<p>This for me is the only sticking point of a great case – there is a card slot in the back of the phone. Where material meets leather, for some reason Lopie made it a pocket. However I have never tucked a card in there, and never will. The small gap is barely noticeable and I struggle to get a finger nail in there to prise it open. Should you wish to use it to store a card or two, I have no doubt the leather will stretch to accommodate this. However once this is done, there is no going back, it will be a pocket forever.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2017-12-28-Lopie-seaisland-buttons-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a0e50da76d.jpg\" alt=\"2017 12 28 Lopie seaisland buttons 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h1><strong>Feel</strong></h1>\n<p>The pouch does mean that there is a difference in height of the two materials. When handling the phone, you will notice a ‘lip’ that takes a little getting used to when compared to standard staple cases. For the last couple of years I have settled into moving backwards and forwards between an Apple Leather case, and also an Apple silicone case. So having any difference in texture felt strange to start but an easy enough compromise.</p>\n<p>The leather strangely ads a certain slippery feel when compared to the grip of the material at the top. However I have every confidence the leather will age well, and some doubts that the top of the case will do the same. The case will provide a good level of drop protection but the material will definitely suffer should it happen outside.</p>\n<p>The designers have offset the grey fabric against extremely tactile if a little garish buttons. They compliment the colouring of the leather reasonably well, however highlighted handset buttons seem to be the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/lets-talk-about-that-pixel-2-contrast-color-button-though/\">in look at the moment</a>. With that said they are sturdy and offer reassuring clicks when pressed, something missing from most cases around this price point.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>This is a great case for the price point. It offers luxury akin to the official Apple cases but at a fraction of the price. It will take a while to get to you, but it is definitely worth the wait. The attention to detail on the buttons and also the second sim and ejection tool pocket found inside the case, all lead me to believe in the workmanship gone into the Lopie Sea Island Corton Series case.</p>\n<p>More than anything, this case has made me realise how much I would love a case made of the fabric material. Google did a great job with the Pixel case, and I’m hoping someone will make one in the very near future. However this case is one of the best I have tried. Stylish and comfortable to hold without much bulk.</p>\n<p>You can buy the Lopie Sea Island Corton Series case in Light brown <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075D8LT12/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B075D8LT12&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=0f1e5d08361281d9e08c2252c5fa7a17\">from Amazon</a>, it is also available in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075D8R8CX/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B075D8R8CX&amp;linkId=e7faa700b036d67814c768bdc8097b50\">Coffee Brown</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075DCHGLF/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B075DCHGLF&amp;linkId=3a7b46dec0660dbc69dba02ce1435226\">Dark Brown</a>.

				"title": "Journaling With Day One Review",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>I’ve been toying with the idea of journaling for a long time. I’ve started jotting things down several times, but never really got the hang of it. Although I liked the idea of having a <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/23f1d1c23df5?source=linkShare-fa062289c217-1512807706\">physical diary of my thoughts</a>, I was always worried it wouldn’t stay personal. So a digital version seemed like the only way and thats where Day One comes it. Helping me to journal as much as I like keeping it safe and secure.</p>\n<p>The version in current use is actually the second iteration by developer <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/day-one-journal/id1044867788?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4\">Bloom Built</a>. Even this iteration has existed since 2016, so this is not a new app or service. Many users have been on a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ljrain/status/931876494325972992\">steak for years</a>, and the app is constantly being improved and updated. I’ve been using it on and off for 3 years to store some thoughts, as well as setting up IFTTT recipes to capture <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/applets/395684p\">my Instagram</a>and blog posts. However over the past few weeks I’ve been using it daily to capture my thoughts and feelings to much benefit to my mental health.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2017-12-09-day-One-mockups-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/923899ceee.jpg\" alt=\"2017 12 09 day One mockups 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Using the app</strong></h2>\n<p>The design of the app is extremely easy to understand and dare I say it very pleasing to use. If you wish to make an entry simply tap on the cross in the main area or at the bottom of your entry list. The icons at the bottom of the screen are a little confusing, from left to right you have the option to quickly change journal (you need a plus or greater to do this), filter image moats, make an entry, show the locations of your posts or bring up a large calendar.</p>\n<p>Once you get the hang of these they become natural but certainly could be be more clear. For example you can also change journal in the top left of the main screen, so why you need two options is unclear. However a small UI confusion can be forgive because the rest of the interface is very clear and easy to use. Tap either cross to make a post and begin your journaling journey.</p>\n<p>In the entry screen you can add in text formatted as you desire with headings and other styling. You can also add in photos already taken or capture you own straight from the app. Many other apps I have tried prioritise text entires above anything else, but with Day One I have clipped in images that have caught my eye, and many that have displayed my current feelings in an image. If I simply want to enter a location for me to expand on later, I can open the Apple Watch app to drop a pin or dictate a quick entry.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2017-12-12-dayone-watch-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/33190ec48c.jpg\" alt=\"2017 12 12 dayone watch 1\" width=\"1400\" height=\"369\" border=\"0\" />If you wish to post your entries to other platforms such as a blog there are several export options through the share sheet.</p>\n<p>Those wishing to capture every inch of their lives can also automatically add locations, current weather, tags and even your activity data to journal entries. Don’t worry if this is too much information for you to give up because not only is syncing encrypted between devices (Premium required), you can also secure the app with passcode or TouchID/FaceID.</p>\n<h2><strong>Price</strong></h2>\n<p>Day One has adopted the subscription payment model that causes so much divide in opinion. I purchased the app before this move so I get a slightly different level but for new customers you have a choice of level.</p>\n<p>The App is completely free to download and use. You can journal away and never pay a penny. With the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One journal</li>\n<li>One photo per entry</li>\n<li>Unlimited entries</li>\n<li>Local backups (including iCloud device backups)</li>\n<li>Exporting (PDF, JSON, Plain Text)</li>\n<li>Book Printing</li>\n<li>Activity Feed (iOS)</li>\n<li>Maintenance and non-Premium updates as needed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Users can then upgrade should they wish to add in extra features. This costs $34.99 USD/year or $3.99 USD/month. For this price on top of the free features you shall receive:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited journals</li>\n<li>30 photos per entry</li>\n<li>Mac app with Premium features</li>\n<li>Unlimited syncing with Day One Sync</li>\n<li>End-to-end encryption with Day One Sync</li>\n<li>Discount on book printing (currently available in US only)</li>\n<li>IFTTT integration</li>\n<li>Access to Day One Web (beta) and Android (when released)</li>\n<li>Future access to Premium features like audio recording, writing prompts, video entries, additional photos per entry, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although a subscription service <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/29/day-one-app-now-a-subscription-service/\">always proves to be controversial</a>, most users simply do not need to pay anything. Day One offers fantastic value for money for those wanting to get started. Users can to dive straight in and start filling in a journal with unlimited entries including one photo for free. Only if you require multiple journals, syncing, or <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/day-one/id1055511498?mt=12&amp;at=1000ltj4\">access to the Mac app</a> will you need to spend any money. Providing that you use iCloud backups when you get a new device, you won’t even need to worry about syncing to the cloud.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2017-12-12-Dayonemacapp-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/85c5343f34.jpg\" alt=\"2017 12 12 Dayonemacapp 1\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>URL Support</strong></h2>\n<p>Day One has great support for third party API use and also URL schemes for new entries and opening into specific areas.</p>\n<p>Create Entry with Text <code>dayone://post?entry=</code> Create Entry with Tags: <code>dayone://post?entry=Hello Self&amp;tags=My Tag, Test</code> Create Entry in Journal: <code>dayone://post?entry=Hello Self&amp;journal=Day One</code> Create Entry with Clipboard Image: <code>dayone://post?entry=Hello Self&amp;imageClipboard=1</code></p>\n<p>This will allow you to use use shortcuts in <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/launcher-with-multiple-widgets/id905099592?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4\">Launcher</a> or <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4\">Launch Centre Pro</a>. <a href=\"http://dayoneapp.com/2016/03/day-one-ifttt/\">IFTTT support</a> requires the paid upgrade, however the API only works as a write API, there is no read API. So support is limited to ‘THAT’ rather than universal usage. I have asked Day One for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GR36/status/939461078471335936\">expanded support</a>, and it isn’t on their roadmap as yet.</p>\n<p>There are also a wide range of tools available for Day One, ranging from <a href=\"https://github.com/underscorephil/todoist_dayone\">Todoist scripts</a> to importing entries from other apps. So you really can dig in and make Day One the centre of <a href=\"https://intercom.help/dayone/day-one-2-0/day-one-tools\">your daily routine</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>In contrast to every other <a href=\"/tags/app/\">app I have reviewed in the past</a>, the conclusion for this app split into two areas. The benefits of Journaling regularly have paid off on my mental health, and allowed me to write down the way I am feeling without the worry of those feelings being exposed to anyone else but me. There is also the conclusion of using the app itself.</p>\n<p>Day one provides the opportunity for you to use the app completely free of charge and reap the benefits. I have used other Journaling options and dismissed them straight away due to ease of use. There are no such issue with Day One, the app is really easy to use, and is very well designed for the most part. If you want to start journaling, look no further than the Day One.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "iPhone X Initial Impressions",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>As you may or may not know I don’t bother <a href=\"/post/2017-07-07-ipad-pro-initial-impressions/\">writing reviews anymore</a>. There are hundreds of great videos and long form pieces out there to satiate your appetite for that kind of thing. However I usually share my initial thoughts on using new devices – and here are mine on the iPhone X.</p>\n<p>This unwillingness to spend hours wiring a full review is further exaggerated by the hype surrounding Apples new device. There isn’t much to write that hasn’t already been covered in one way or another. The hardware is top notch see what I did there) but I didn’t expect anything less. Apple’s design <a href=\"/post/2017-10-06-apple-design-failing/\">compromises and hardware choices</a> may be questionable now, but their ability to <a href=\"/post/2017-11-06-apples-service-advantage/\">make a customer feel</a> happy they are spending lots of money is undeniable.</p>\n<p>The phone itself is another step forward in quality feel from previous iPhones. The use of polished metal and glass makes for an extremely premium feeling device. Anyone that handles it will feel like they are touching a thousand pounds worth of device. Using these materials does have a trade off in weight, the iPhone X is noticeably heavier than similar devices, this is without doubt a reassuring feel but it hurts my pinky when adopting my usual grip.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"iphone-x-notes-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8a4ce78c61.jpg\" alt=\"Iphone x notes 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h1><strong>Screen</strong></h1>\n<p>The 5.8” OLED display dominates the front of the phone, this is no more obvious than when first powering on the phone. The white screen of the setup screen creates wonder and intrigue from the very first second. Combine this with the boost in resolution to 2436×1125-pixel resolution at 458ppi and the True Tone technology you have a device that not only looks but feels like the future.</p>\n<p>Of course it isn’t, this is Apple playing catch up to the Galaxy S series but for an Apple user the brightness of an OLED that keeps the Apple colour accuracy tremendously improves the experience. Even in bright sunshine the screen is bright and easy to view.</p>\n<p>The usable area of the handset is going to frustrate users coming from a iPhone Plus model, the keyboard does not have the space that the wider handset provides. Although I have found the device fantastic to use, I often write on my phone and have found it a much better experience than my previous regular sized iPhone 7. Apps and webpages are much more suited to a taller display, meaning the keyboard is a little taller and raised slightly towards the middle of the phone than previous models.</p>\n<p>There is without doubt a blue shift when looking at the screen at very acute angles, it remains to be seen about burn in – but these are just the ofset things about OLED screens. The screen is stunning in every situation and the notch disappears almost instantly and is a complete non issue.</p>\n<h1><strong>True Depth And FaceID</strong></h1>\n<p>The notch allows for one of the most controversial features of the new phone, FaceID. By removing the home button and going all in on FaceID Apple have changed the way you use your phone. I am not a massive fan of this shift in authentication however it has meant that being more secure has faded into the background. It has worked flawlessly for me, all meant that I no longer have to think about pasting in passwords from 1 Password or entering secure apps.</p>\n<p>As stared of for this, using the device flat on a table is slightly more awkward, and holding the device pointing at your face needs to become a habit. Going forward I have no doubt that this will improve, however as it stands right now it is absolutely fine.</p>\n<p>The true depth camera has also allowed for portrait selfies, which works as described and also animating your very own emoji. Animoji is a unsurprising hit, if a little annoying for those that don’t have an iPhone X. I have no doubt this fad will run out of steam, but at the moment it is a enjoyable way to communicate.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"iPhone-X-Camera-portrait-1-1.jpeg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bb3d6b9491.jpg\" alt=\"IPhone X Camera portrait 1 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"334\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h1><strong>Camera</strong></h1>\n<p>I wouldn’t go so far as to say I am disappointed in the camera, but it doesn’t offer anything over the camera on the iPhone 8 Plus. It does feature OIS on both of the lenses but I am yet to see any benefit to this. Zoomed images are still noisy and fail to capture quite a few snaps I have tried. I still default to using the wider lens and getting a bit closer, which is a real shame.</p>\n<p>Focus also takes quite a long time to action, I feel the camera app itself is not intelligent enough for a modern smartphone and wonder if it is trying to do too much before taking a snap. Perhaps adopting an post processing model would make the experience better – and for the love of god please do something with the increased screen size!</p>\n<p>Not even a week since getting the phone I would say I am very pleased with the phone overall. It doesn’t change the way the phone is used, bar the new gesture based navigation. This still takes a little too much brain power to remember, however this must remove ten years of muscle memory so I have no doubt it will sink in soon and feel natural.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally it is still an iPhone and those that are Android users are not going to be attracted. However Apple have caught up to the pack now and sell a modern smartphone. For someone so on the fence about buying the phone I am very glad I did. I am not sure those that purchase their phone outright and have a modern iPhone should rush to upgrade, however if your in the market for an upgrade look no further than the X.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>There has been lots and lots of noise following the iPhone event on Tuesday, Which is one of the reasons I have left this post for a few days. As normal falling into two camps of opinion, which is always to be expected, however the prevailing narrative is that the iPhone x is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16291244/new-iphone-x-photos-video-hands-on\">the future of smartphones</a> in a product made now – unfortunately this simply is not true.</p>\n<p>The truth is that once phones like Samsung’s <a href=\"http://www.coolsmartphone.com/2017/06/30/a-mobile-love-story-comparing-the-galaxy-s8-and-the-lg-g6/\">Galaxy S8, the LG G6</a> and various others from <a href=\"https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/09/mi-mix-2-designer-philippe-starck-talks-phone-design-bezels.html\">Chinese OEMs</a> started hitting the market the traditional iPhone design became old. It was certainly iconic, but rooted in design and technical capability of a decade ago.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/63051934c9.jpg\" alt=\"IPhoneX mockup png 1\" title=\"iPhoneX-mockup.png-1.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"283\" />Smartphone manufacturers are already producing handset of equal design and production quality equal to the iPhone X. The bitter pill to swallow is that Cupertino until now had been relying on legacy install base for sales results. The materials used and the manufacturing process may be a large step forward, but the design of the iPhone X shows that Apple is just catching up to the already high bar.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that Apple have crammed in a huge amount of technology and achieved a screen to body ration that is <a href=\"http://www.gsmarena.com/iphone%5C_x%5C_screen%5C_to%5C_body%5C_ratio%5C_compared-news-27264.php\">leading the pack</a> – but does this really matter to users? FaceID although very impressive, feels a little too much like a compromise. Questions still exist if Apple believe this is the way we authenticate for years to come, or if it was developed simply because they couldn’t get TouchID to work under the screen.</p>\n<p>Samsung beat Apple to a full screen handset and are set to have another crack at it in a few months time. Leaving Apple to inevitably play catch up once again. iPhone X is not tomorrow design today, it is todays design but a few months late.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Sure enough, just after deciding that my workflow of using <a href=\"http://www.gr36.com/bear-and-ulysses/\">Bear and Ulysses</a> to write all of my content was pretty much perfect – I’ve changed again. For the past week I have been exploring using Apple Notes instead of Bear now that iOS11 is about to drop, and it seems to be working very well.</p>\n<p>The Stock Notes app on iOS has rightly got a lot of stick over the years. There are some people <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/ios/ipad-diaries-optimizing-apple-notes/\">that wouldn’t use anything else</a>, but many more users simply require a much more powerful app. <a href=\"http://www.gr36.com/bear-the-serious-notes-app/\">Bear has filled that gap</a> for me since launch, making writing in markdown a beautiful experience and dead simple. However it always felt a little redundant paying for two subscriptions when they both do a very similar job. After learning how to improve lots of areas of my organisation through the <a href=\"http://www.gr36.com/learn-ulysses-writing-app/\">Learn Ulysses course</a> this was even more the case, so I wanted a replacement.</p>\n<h2><strong>Apple Notes in iOS11</strong></h2>\n<p>With iOS11 Apple have improved Notes in many ways to make it more user friendly. Filing has become much more simple, drag and drop works flawlessly and the overall speed and app experience is much smoother. These improvements make it much easier to jot down quick ideas, saves links to look at later and even do some drafting if your heat desires.</p>\n<p>What’s more I can use Siri to dictate a note I quickly think of, and unfortunately <a href=\"http://www.gr36.com/siri-falls-down-default-apps/\">Siri cant do that</a> for every app at the moment. There is also the option to make hand written notes or annotations in line with text, add in images and lots of things you couldn’t do very well or the implementation was a bit clunky. One thing particularly useful is the ability to quickly launch the Notes app with an Apple Pencil double tap on the lock screen.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bb02dad611.jpg\" alt=\"Image 05 09 2017 12 11 1\" title=\"Image-05-09-2017-12-11-1.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"425\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Downsides</strong></h2>\n<p>I still miss a few things that can be found in more powerful apps. Tagging being the main one, as there is no way to organise notes other than in chronological order from last edited or Alphabetical. Folders are possible, however going backwards and forwards between them is not an easy task on iOS. This is partly made up for by a very fast and reliable search function, which even understands your handwriting if you’ve made some notes with the Apple Pencil.</p>\n<p>The worst thing for publishing is Apple Notes app insisting on using a weird version of Rich text so converting to markdown is a pain. I created an <a href=\"https://workflow.is/workflows/b75d1fc9f97e476d8a3e3765321184ea\">Apple Notes to markdown Workflow</a> which automates the switch to Markdown, which is infinitely more friendly to work with for publishing. This Workflow also copies the resulting Markdown to a new sheet in my ‘ideas’ folder of Ulysses. I can then continue to draft this until I’m happy, add images and publish.</p>\n<p>There is no X-Callback URL support in Notes what so ever, and the sharing of notes to other apps can sometimes go a little wonky depending on the app. However all in all the improvements made to app have made it a serious contender to be put back on many users main screen.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1bc9449bf0.jpg\" alt=\"Apple notes iphone7 1\" title=\"apple-notes-iphone7-1.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>I would like to see more user features in upcoming versions of Notes, perhaps the ability to change the font to something more readable. Proper Rich Text would be much easier to use than the current implementation, but I’d really love basic text or markdown support – although I don’s see that ever happening. However I would edge you to give notes another chance and see if the improvements make your life easier.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Ding! One new post incoming.</p>\n<p>I think everyone will agree notifications from your technology are annoying. Yet everyone puts up with them to a point where it’s just a haze of buzzing, beeping and dinging that rings in your ears for your entire waking hours. I have <a href=\"https://www.byodpodcast.com/episodes/episode-1-renders-of-leaks-of-lies/30/4/2017\" rel=\"nofollow\">talked quite a bit</a>about being engaged with the world and notifications are my next assault.</p>\n<p>For the past couple of weeks I have been experimenting with tuning out all non essential notifications. Unfortunately the iPhone doesn’t have a notification system that is as intelligent as Android, but it allows for some tuning and minimisation. However this extends to tablets, computers and my favourite bit of technology smartwatches.</p>\n<h2>The Apple Watch</h2>\n<p>Previously a big advocate of the Apple Watch, the wrist strapped device has allowed me to be more engaged and silence my phone more often. Yet the action of checking my watch when it taps me on the wrist is almost a greater social faux pars than glancing at a phone.</p>\n<p>Smart watches are more of a balance than other equipment in use. On one hand it allows the accompanying phone to be on silent much of the time and interruption for only important notifications. Yet on the other its a piece of technology strapped to your wrist for the sole purpose of solving a problem that is easier solved.</p>\n<h2>Notification tuning</h2>\n<p>This is a movement I want more users to be aware of, notifications are easy to control and manage straight from your handset. Only you can decide what you need to see, if you need it to beep, or if its important to you. Personally social media notifications are turned off for me, as are pointless app such as games and shopping apps.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/751a770039.jpg\" alt=\"2017 10 23 notification screenshots 1\" title=\"2017-10-23-notification-screenshots-1.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"412\" />These types of apps have a tendency to pop up notifications for little reason other than to get you engaged with the app again. Attention is the commodity the trade from and sell it to advertisers. If there is nothing important the app can tell you, switch them firmly to off!</p>\n<p>The rest is up to you, experiment with what you need interrupting your life. Despite you t<a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/digital/needy-technology-too-many-notifications-causes-users-to-tune-out/\" rel=\"nofollow\">hinking that it doesn’t affect</a> you it’s surprising how much calmer and happier your life becomes from seeing less pointless information.</p>\n<p>The only issue with this approach is the possibility of gameify your notifications. Constantly checking the app to see if you have any notifications. There is no way around overcoming this, the apps and screens we use are <a href=\"https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/what-is-technology-doing-to-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">specifically designed to keep us engaged</a> in them. Hopefully sanity will prevail and you will quickly realise that many of you beeps and dings are simply not useful to you.</p>\n<p>There also needs to be some realisation from a user that it is also quite arrogant to think you need to answer every notification straight back. Not only in the self created bubble where you think that you are so important enough to warrant an immediate reply. Also that picking your phone up in the middle of being engaged in something else is amazingly annoying.</p>\n<p>Without getting too critical and socially scolding this issues is almost socially accepted now. We all have a story of observing others who are too engrossed in another activity to be aware of what is around them. Yet the haze will continue until more people cut out the noise.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"title": "A Smaller Phone Makes Me Much Happier",
				"content_html": "<p>Since just before Christmas I’ve been questioning many things in my life and making improvements wherever I can. Not due to anything in particular, simply an attempt to make myself happier and more engaged with life. This has lead me to some great places. I have been <a href=\"https://medium.com/simple-words/me-meditating-yeah-right-be7ae66f1c5\">meditating</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/simple-words/social-media-and-my-mind-77ade3309982\">cutting down my social media use</a> and for the most part <a href=\"https://medium.com/simple-words/turn-the-phone-over-c72b99cbb58a\">cutting down my phone usage</a>. Not only for the benefit of me, but also for the benefit of the people around me.</p><p>Around a month ago I made the decision to ditch my pocket busting iPhone 7 plus, and downsize. In fact I opted for something significantly smaller, an iPhone SE. The amount of questions I have received is quite shocking, but the answer to anyone wondering why, is both long and complicated.</p><p>I went into a reasonable amount of detail on an episode of the <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/byod_podcast/episode02\">Bring your own device podcast</a>. Which covers much of my feelings around my smartphone. This ultimately devolves into two parts. The first of which is why an iPhone SE and the second is why bother.</p><h3 id=\"why-an-se\">Why an SE?</h3><p>Well I’m not adverse to using a smaller phone, I used an iPhone 5s (that is still in my draw) for quite a while. Yet I wanted the whole experience, I didn’t want to loose Apple Pay and the better camera so an iPhone SE seemed ideal. Couple with this the fact that the SE doesn’t seem to have maintained its resale value like other iPhones, I managed to pick up a 64gb version for just £200.</p><p>The IPhone SE is an amazing handset, especially given the price point that I picked it up for. It keeps all of the build quality, attention to detail and ability, yet reduces the strain on my pocket and my mind. However it is not all good news, there are some compromises to using something that is a few years old now. I miss the iPhone 7 new style home button, regular buttons now feel archaic, and the hardware is far from perfect. This most obvious of which is the low resolution screen and the battery life.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/d2005f6876.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><h3 id=\"why-bother\">Why bother</h3><p>The real answer is very complicated, so strap yourself in for a bumpy ride. It’s going to get very preachy and very weird for someone so engrained in technology like myself. The reasons for which are not to dissimilar to my feelings surrounding <a href=\"https://medium.com/simple-words/the-dangers-of-being-a-phonehobo-d1db2fabd31a\">not becoming an phonehobo</a>.</p><p>Currently the smartphone is both bringing us together and tearing us apart. That is not a local issue, it is a human problem, the smartphone is coming between human interaction is a huge way. We are not the humans from Wall-E on big floating chairs yet, but scientific research says we are not far away.</p><p>Research <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/4661907/The_effect_of_smart_phones_on_social_interaction\">tells us that the sheer presence of a smartphone</a> make interaction less meaningful for both parties and gives the illusion of neither party being engaged. It changes the very ideas we form when interacting and changes them for the worst. This is not a debatable occurrence, it is undeniable consequence of having this equipment around.</p><p>The fact is that most people won’t care, but when I am also responsible for two young kids that should feel my engagement with them as much as I do, then it is an issue for more than just myself.</p><p>I remember a time when I was mad that an Android phone I was testing didn’t get more than 4 hours screen on time. Even in a week that’s more than a whole day just staring at my phone. If moving from 5.5inches down to just 4” forces me to use my phone less, it’s a win for everyone.</p><p>The consequence of having a much smaller screen on my phone is that my phone is now a phone and not a computer in my pocket. The motivation, if not simply the ability, for me to do things on my phone is almost completely removed. I am much happier with a smaller phone, and I am not alone making this switch – give it a try and you might find the same.</p>\n",

				"title": "Zoho Notebook Review",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>There can’t be many iOS or Mac app for note taking that I still haven’t tried. As soon as I’ve reviewed an app, gone through all the setting up process and made a choice to switch, I start looking around for other apps. I have a major fear of missing out on something that could be a better fit. Truth be told it costs me a fortune, subscription services or expensive one off payments seem to be normal now – but not with Zoho Notebook.</p>\n<p>Notebook by Zoho is completely free, with a promise for it to always to remain so. There are no adverts, no add ons and nothing to pay – ever. That’s a big promise but the costs of supporting the app are maintained by the developers other projects. They make a lot of other products, but have a huge aim for this one, for it to be the best!</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2017-10-24-zoho-search-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0b09635ff2.jpg\" alt=\"2017 10 24 zoho search 1\" width=\"596\" height=\"68\" border=\"0\" />Zoho set their stall out early and <a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/notebook/evernote-alternative.html\">advertise themselves as a free Evernote alternative</a>. “Looking for an alternative to Evernote? we can’t blame you” sits proudly on their webpage, indicating very early their intentions. They truly believe Notebook is a much better app, available for free with “roughly 80% of Evernote’s features”. Notebook is available for iOS and Android with a <a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/notebook/notebook-for-mac.html\">companion Mac app</a> should you wish to work on desktop to. This includes a safari plug in for working with webpages, unfortunately there is no web access as yet.</p>\n<p>An app for Windows is also missing, so this can’t be considered truly multi platform and offer everything Evernote does. Although with that said the Mac app is a relatively new addition, missed from several reviews so it may come in the future. The Mac app also support the 2016 MacBook Pro Touch Bar, so you can tap through shortcuts and also secure your notes with Touch ID as you can on an iPhone or iPad.</p>\n<p>They also promise that they will never, in contrast to Evernote, look at your notes or information. There is a conflicting back and forth whenever this is discussed, however if that practice is a concern of yours then Zoho is the place to go first. Bare in mind also that sync is provided by their own servers and not iCloud so there is a small compromise to be made.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2017-10-24-zoho-screenshot-1.jpeg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/81544cb9fc.jpg\" alt=\"2017 10 24 zoho screenshot 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"398\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong><strong>Design</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>The Evernote comparisons don’t just end with the applications intentions either. It is clear where they get the inspiration from, but if I’m allowed to be somewhat subjective they do a much better job of it. Notebook is often considered one of the <a href=\"https://gr36.com/zoho-notebook-review/thenextweb.com/apps/2016/07/13/zoho-notebook-prettiest-note-taking-mobile-app-youll-ever-use/?amp=1\">best looking notes apps you will come across</a>, and I couldn’t disagree. The design and layout of every option is well thought through, if a little minimalistic. Great design is something that can become increasingly difficult when your app does as much as this one.</p>\n<p>The main display of the app takes its inspiration from physical notebooks. Allowing users to split notes into different books based on whatever you wish. This could be the purpose of the note, or a category of your choosing. You can then customise these with its own front cover from a large selection and display the notebook to your own liking.</p>\n<p>This is a design choice I have consciously stayed away from with other apps in the past and much prefer a traditional notes app display. There is no way to tag notes or display them on any other way than one notebook or another. This took a little getting used to, and feels a little strange. It is also worth noting that even on the iPhone 7 plus there is no landscape layout which is more than a little annoying.</p>\n<p>Inside the Notebooks are your actual notes, displayed either by date or alphabetically. These are customisable with different background colours, although these can only be defined after creation. You can create simple text notes, but also drawings, voice memos and checklists. The display of the note is tailored for the note type, so audio is playable and images are very visible.</p>\n<p>The four options to start a note are a little confusing at first, and it should be questioned if they are really needed. Notebook has the ability for a note to contain multiple note types, but you must start with a text note. So there is no ability to add text to a voice memo. Zoho should consider implementing a similar approach to OneNote and treat all notes the same, this would offer a much more understandable experience.</p>\n<p>If you like to scribble down your thoughts handwritten notes are one of the most pleasurable things about Notebook. The developers have taken great care in making sure your quick doodles or jotted notes are taken care of. This works very well with the Apple Pencil, although you can use any stylus or indeed your finger if required.</p>\n<p>There is nothing worse than spending ages looking for the note you previously made and Zoho does everything they can to make notes easy to find. There is no OCR on hand written notes unfortunately so search will only include your text notes but will search through all notebooks with perfect results on each version of the app.</p>\n<p>You can also snap pictures, clip webpages and even add a full article into here – particularly handy if you read lots of webpages or store ideas all into one notebook.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2017-10-24-zoho-clipper-1.jpeg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e5b2cadc25.jpg\" alt=\"2017 10 24 zoho clipper 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"413\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong><strong>Web Clipper</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>One of the standout features of Notebook is their <a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/notebook/web-clipper.html\">web clipper</a>, which is something that every app with at least some enterprise ambitions must include. You’re able to easily clip text, images and also entire articles and save them to your included unlimited storage.</p>\n<p>When clipping a webpage there is an inbuilt option to clear the page of everything other than the article. Which removes those pesky ads and videos we all hate. This option could help some eliminate a read it later service or a long list of bookmarks. It works surprisingly well, equal to that of Pocket or Instapaper removing all adverts but also images. Although it lacks some customisation for reading options such as font type so couldn’t completely replace an offline reader for pure functionality.</p>\n<p>However Notebook <em><em>could</em></em> very easily replace a service such as Pinterest for saving ideas around any subject all in one place.</p>\n<h2><strong><strong>Zoho Notebook Verdict</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>The app is missing out on too many features for <em><em>my</em></em> personal use, but I do wonder how many people pay for a service such as Evernote and would be perfectly fine with this app. However there are some things missing to truly complete with the large services people use.</p>\n<p>Much of my cons with the app are related to my specific use case. I would love to see a tagging and labelling system rather than based on traditional books. There is no way for me to add a note to more than one book, which might seems strange but some of my text needs to be displayed in multiple places.</p>\n<p>There is also no collaboration or sharing available within the app with sync only provided by their own servers. Notes are not kept in iCloud or Dropbox so your pretty much locked into the service once started. There is also no URL scheme support available which is detrimental to my Workflow and therefore iPad usage.</p>\n<p>With that said this new upstart in an already very crowded area is a welcome addition. If you <em><em>are</em></em> looking for something free, easy to use and with simple features there is no point looking anywhere else than here or <a href=\"http://www.gr36.com/google-keep-as-a-writing-tool/\">perhaps Google Keep</a>. The future looks very promising for Zoho Notebook as this is still a new app in development, so I will be keeping an eye on them with interest.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "One year of the iPad Pro as my computer",
				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The shocked look when I tell people that my primary computing device is an iPad is brilliant. I’ve actually been working on an iPad for a little over two years, and have replaced pretty much all of my computing with an iPad. First with an iPad Air 2 and now with a 9.7” iPad Pro.</p>\n<p>With pretty much the same argument to working on a Chromebook, people are too eager to dismiss the iPad as a computer. When the truth is it’s actually pretty easy. With a little investment in software and some time invested in setting things up the way that suits you best. You can do. Out of your daily tasks with little thought, but dig in deep and you can do 99% of your requirements on one device.</p>\n<p>Quite a few of my <a href=\"http://darylbaxter.com/\">friends have adopted the same approach</a> now the iPad has a great keyboard case, and use it as I do. Unfortunately most people don’t want to put in the time and are often dismissive, however I really think more people should embrace the iPad as a computer.</p>\n<h2><strong>Apps to do anything</strong></h2>\n<p>Let’s be honest, as great as iOS10 is there are still holes in Apples OS. Thankfully most of these are filled by the rich app ecosystem. I have spent far too much money on apps over the years, and unfortunately most of the expense has been on apps that I no longer use. Reviewing the use case of new apps, trying things out and experimenting. Only for it ultimately to fall short in some area, not meet my needs or very often become superseded by something better.</p>\n<p>I never have many apps on my iPad, but what I do have installed are used often. I made the mistake very early on of carrying around a replica of my iPhone on a bigger scale, but quickly realised there is no need. Both devices have completely different uses and should be treated as such. Don’t flood your iPad with social and communication apps unless you intend to use them often.</p>\n<p>With that all said there are a few apps I can’t do without:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workflow</li>\n<li>Ulysses</li>\n<li>Notes – <a href=\"http://www.gr36.com/2017-01-19-bear-app-review/\">now replace by Bear</a></li>\n<li>Documents</li>\n<li>Medium</li>\n<li>Pocket</li>\n<li>Notability</li>\n<li>Day One</li>\n<li>Linky<br />\nThese apps are the ones used daily, when writing or reading. I have a lot of media apps for watching movies or TV shows at the gym or while traveling, but your use case will vary. I will not go into extensive details about everything I use, but give you a shallow overview, if you want to dig in deep check out <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/working-on-the-ipad-one-year-later-still-my-favorite-computer/\">MacStories second update on</a> using an iPad Pro.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Automation</strong></h2>\n<p>This is where almost everyone I speak to falls off and sticks to more traditional means. Maybe it’s because things are easier, maybe it’s muscle memory, maybe there isn’t a real reason, but users fall by the wayside quite early. However with a little work and research you can pretty much achieve anything you need from a computer and often make it much more straight forward.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a74515050d.jpg\" alt=\"Ipad pro workflow 1\" title=\"ipad-pro-workflow-1.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>Workflow</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/workflow-powerful-automation-made-simple/id915249334?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4\">Workflow is not complicated</a> nor confusing it just takes a little time investment and reading to get the hang of it. I’ve been using the app for more than a year and it is the best app I have ever bought, it is the cornerstone of much of my productivity.</p>\n<p>Think of Workflow as Automator for iOS, plugging into countless (but not every) app and making things much easier. It works by creating recipes by dropping actions together. You can then feed information into the recipe, ‘run’ them and get your desired outcome.</p>\n<p>I have invested time in making Workflow recipes or finding <a href=\"https://workflow.directory/\">them in other people’s blogs</a> and making them my own. They do all sorts of things for me, from resizing images for publishing to wrapping my screenshots in device frames and stitching images together.</p>\n<p>My most used of which isn’t my own work but I have modified it slightly for use on my blog. Jordan Merrill created a screenshot builder for you to easily import into your own set up, the full guide is easy to follow and can be <a href=\"https://www.jordanmerrick.com/posts/screenshot-builder-workflow/\">found here</a>. You can also achieve a similar result using the <a href=\"https://appsto.re/gb/42_C2.i\">app LongScreen</a>, select your screenshot and tap the magic wand at the bottom.</p>\n<p>I also use several workflows for resizing images for my featured image sizes and also <a href=\"https://workflow.is/workflows/b4f8cf8ce27841b2a5624d84c83d7d3a\">combining my device images together</a>. However these are only a small selection of workflows that I use, over the last year or so I have built up an armoury of resources. Allowing me to adapt or create recipes for many of my daily tasks.</p>\n<p>There would be no point sharing many of these as they would be unique to my image sizes etc, but they are pretty easy to create with a few minutes digging in. If you are serious about using Workflow there is no better resource than the <a href=\"https://club.macstories.net/\">Club MacStories newsletter</a>, for the small subscription you get access to all of the content created from which there are hundreds of ideas.</p>\n<h2><strong>Notes, words and writing</strong></h2>\n<p>The title of this post started of as “running my blog from an iPad” because that is exactly what I do. I spend most of my time writing on my iPad or digesting what I am about to write. I have used many apps over the years, starting on Google Docs, graduating to the markdown editor Byword. I now use the amazing if a little expensive Ulysses app.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c2d13a3591.jpg\" alt=\"Ipad pro ulysses 1\" title=\"ipad-pro-ulysses-1.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>Ulysses</strong></h3>\n<p>There must already be millions of words already written about Ulysses, it is considered the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ulysses/id623795237?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4\">pro wiring app on Mac</a> and only relatively recently <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ulysses/id950335311?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4\">came across to iOS</a>. I resisted for a long time purely down to price, and the fact that at the time Byword was a perfectly good Markdown editor. Yet the move was smooth and a very rewarding one.</p>\n<p>The deciding factor was publishing. Ulysses allows me to see exactly how an article will look before publishing. Although publishing to WordPress is available from a few different apps, compatibility and preview where always not quite right. Meaning I had to use the a webpage or god forbid the awful WordPress app to correct things. Whereas I can input local images into a document and they will be uploaded along with all of the text.</p>\n<p>Organisation and syncing in Ulysses is also second to none, allowing for articles written on any device I own, syncing to all and organised exactly as I wish. Most other Markdown apps use an iCloud folder sync that can be slow and very unreliable. Not to mention that dumping all of the files in one folder means trying to find an old file can be a nightmare.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c0b0f9c3f2.jpg\" alt=\"Ipad pro bear 1\" title=\"ipad-pro-bear-1.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>Bear</strong></h3>\n<p>The regular old stock Notes app that has been my place to store everything has recently been replaced with Bear. By calling Bear a notes app it is much more approachable. When in reality it is a Markdown editor at heart. Allowing you to add in formatting while typing, for sharing later or simply for your own use. With a couple of key strokes you can add in links, headings, tick boxes, and even images.</p>\n<p>Bear has been expertly designed in both aesthetics and function. All of your notes are listed on the left hand menu, which can be accessed with a right swipe. Once you are editing or looking at a note the developers have made all of the formation options available in a shortcut bar above the keyboard. This sounds a simple thing to do, but lots of others hide these away behind a formatting menu.</p>\n<p>I have slotted Bear in between my current writing app of choice, Ulysses, and my brain. It gives me the ability to format and position text in a small light weight app before moving them to Ulysses for images and publishing.</p>\n<p>I also use Notability quite often for hand written notes, these are usually more work related than writing but there is something really great about hand writing notes. The Apple Pencil also allows me to jot down things if the mood strikes me, although I have found myself not using these as often as I expected. Should the new iPad Pro be launched with a new Apple Pencil I will think twice about punching it as this just isn’t what I have used my iPad for, although many people use it daily.</p>\n<h2><strong>Documents app as a document picker</strong></h2>\n<p>The cry from those dismissive of a productive iOS user is that you can’t do anything without a file system. Unfortunately in the past this may have been true, but since iOS 8 users have been able to do much more and very easily. The introduction of iCloud Drive with iOS 10 is the closest users have come to a file system, and is already proving to be really useful.</p>\n<p>Not only because syncing of documents is much easier, with far more file types supported. With this has come syncing from a mac computer of all users documents into ‘the cloud’. Meaning working from anywhere is possible, whatever you are doing there is a wealth of apps out there to help.</p>\n<p>With that said the major upside to making the ‘drive’ part of iCloud more accessible has been allowing apps to use the storage area to manage files much better. <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/documents-5-file-manager-pdf-reader-and-browser/id364901807?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4\">Documents by Readle</a> is an essential app for users wanting to work with specific files and be productive.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cfa3c836d9.jpg\" alt=\"Ipad pro documents 1\" title=\"ipad-pro-documents-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"597\" height=\"181\" />This plugs in perfectly with PDF expert, which is an essential if you work with PDF like I do. I can open, read, edit or sign documents and email them back. Whereas in the past I would have to print off pages, to then scan them back onto a file again.</p>\n<p>If you don’t want to use iCloud, or you have to use storage elsewhere then Documents can grab documents from Dropbox, Google drive, Box, One Drive and almost everywhere else including an FTP server. The design could do with an update, but it is functional and works perfectly – which is exactly what’s needed.</p>\n<p>Documents can manage almost any file type, allowing users to open, edit and send them inside the app. It even allows you to download and extract zip archives from web links using an internal browser. File management is still not desktop class, but I would argue that it really doesn’t need to be. Ask yourself what you actually need to do with the files on your desktop or laptop and I would say 70% of that can be done on iOS.</p>\n<h2><strong>Medium and reading</strong></h2>\n<p>I’ve been publishing everything for the past year or so to Medium. My personal blog, tech stuff and also posts that I’ve started writing about my daughter and her life with a disability. When I first decided to do this, Medium was fresh and new, with a growing reputation of the place to be. I loved that they had control about how things looked, not only because I didn’t have to work maintaining and managing a theme for the site, but also because everything looked the same.</p>\n<p>It was a place I went to read things, and so did many many other people. Open the app and there was a wealth of available content that was relevant to what you like. Medium expanded my reach to people that had no idea about my website, but perhaps read the same sort of things as I produce. I let their trusty algorithm serve up my posts to people it felt would read it. A win on all sides whichever way you looked at it.</p>\n<p>Even though this has changed over the last few months there is still lots of interesting articles that people publish to the platform, it is a staple app for digesting content. The iPad app is also a really nice writing app to publish from, even though I use Ulysses the Medium app stands up pretty well it terms of usage.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f9699356bc.jpg\" alt=\"Ipad pro dayone 1\" title=\"ipad-pro-dayone-1.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Journaling on Day one</strong></h2>\n<p>For the last couple of years I have gone backwards and forwards with journaling, both in the digital and physical sense. I am no longer writing in here, although it is a great app if you want to write and even publish a blog from here. My usage is as a scrap book to store links to everything I write and pictures I post.</p>\n<p>Along with IFTTT recipes I have stored everything I post for every website I write for, and also Instagram photos. As I produce more and more content on the digital web Day One keeps a record of all this, dated and linked for me to look back on.</p>\n<h2><strong>Pocketing things to read later</strong></h2>\n<p>The reason my iPad is so useful to me is because I can fold it out into a writing device with keyboard and tap away until my hearts content. I can do this for hours with great battery life and then simply fold it up and slip it into a small sleeve in my bag. Yet the greatest thing is pulling the keyboard off and just relaxing, reading a book or more often than not catching up on my <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pocket-save-articles-and-videos-to-view-later/id309601447?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4\">reading list in Pocket</a> .</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/05ad76678c.jpg\" alt=\"Ipad pro pocket 1\" title=\"ipad-pro-pocket-1.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" />I have gone backwards and forward with read it later services over the last few weeks, but in reality there is only two to be considered. Pocket or <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=100ltj4\">Instapaper</a>, it is that simple. I recently switched away to Instapaper, and even <a href=\"http://www.gr36.com/how-to-move-from-pocket-to-instapaper/\">wrote a guide on how to do it easily</a>, but after some issues with Instapaper syncing I’m back using Pocket. The social sharing and also the recommended articles are a great service where you can discover things that may have slipped you by.</p>\n<p>Setting this up with IFTTT recipes for sharing is dead easy, and you can even follow your social media friends to see what they are recommending and widen your reading circle.</p>\n<h2><strong>Sharing with Linky</strong></h2>\n<p>I discovered Linky <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/linky-adds-a-more-powerful-share-sheet-to-ios-8/\">completely by chance whilst looking</a> for something to share links on a business twitter account I manage. This simple app is one of the most straight forward but yet the most confusing if you dive straight in. In broad terms it is a share sheet app that allows easy sharing of information to multiple accounts on social mediate in recent updates it has gained lots more features.</p>\n<p>When opening the app you are greeted with nothing but a browser, yet its real power comes from the share sheet. This is indispensable to me for sharing to more than one twitter account, but also for clearing Apple News links! This caught me out several times when sharing interesting articles, meaning people on other platforms cannot read them, nor can people that have removed the app.</p>\n<p>When sharing from inside Apple News Linky will find the regular link and share that instead.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/92cd4e9ae7.jpg\" alt=\"Ipad pro linky 1 1\" title=\"ipad-pro-linky-1-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"241\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Can’t Do’s</strong></h2>\n<p>Unfortunately the iPad just cant do everything, there are some things that a desktop type browser is essential and no amount of mediating with Documents will work. This ranges from simple things such as options and menus not appearing on mobile safari version of web pages. Right the way through to recording audio whilst taking part in a podcast.</p>\n<p>These types of things crop up in the most annoying places, such as my resent adventure <a href=\"http://www.gr36.com/how-to-move-from-pocket-to-instapaper/\">moving from Pocket to Instapaper</a>. There are also gaps in the armoury that is provided by the App Store to. For example the desktop version of Garadgeband is a great app for editing podcast audio, yet the iPad app doesn’t even entertain the idea.</p>\n<p>There is still no option for these few very important use case of mine. So sitting in front of a Mac is still unavoidable for some tasks. Although these issues are decreasing more and more over time. Using an iPad is less about computing power and more about versatility. Perhaps this is the reason many Windows laptop have taken the convertible route? I am more than certain we will never see a convertible macOS device, but we already have a brilliant iOS one.</p>\n<h2><strong>Using an iPad</strong></h2>\n<p>As more and more people realise that much of what they need to do on a ‘computer’ can be done on less traditional hardware the world changes. The frustration is users being put off by media commentary before they have ever tried using one, the same headlines written by tech blogs are regurgitated by end users. I see the same people argue that you can’t work on an iPad are many of the same supporting the use of a Chromebook.</p>\n<p>I would challenge everyone to find many use cases where you can’t use an iPad for most of your computing tasks. The iPad offers unrivalled battery life for usage whilst traveling, combined with something that is lighter than any laptop available.</p>\n<p>The OS and extensive suite of apps in many ways are more capable and straight forward than a desktop OS. If you want to make the most of using your iPad as a computer, it doesn’t have to be an iPad Pro at all. Yet you will need to spend a bit of time deciding what you want to use it for, and open your mind to the possibility.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’m starting to think I have a problem, I just can’t leave things alone. Once I find a great app that does what I need, I write the review and then start looking at other options.</p>\n<p>Days after finding <a href=\"http://www.gr36.com/bear-the-serious-notes-app/\">Bear to write everything from short notes to full posts</a> I was eyeing up other Notes apps. I decided to give Google Keep a try and it is actually pretty good. Not really as a notes app, but for reminders and todo lists.</p>\n<p>I’m sure it makes a very good notes app for those quick little notes you occasionally need. The whole UI is based around post it notes after all, yet it doesn’t hold a candle to other notes apps in terms of features.</p>\n<p>You can attach images, voice notes and URL’s but only one per note. Users can also forget about any kind of formatting or inline linking, but these features don’t feature in the stock iOS app either. It is only third party options, that usually come at a premium, that leave Google Keep in their wake. With all that said it does everything <em><em>most</em></em> people will need to do. Doing the simple things very well indeed and syncing notes to iOS, Android and the web.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a87972beab.jpg\" alt=\"Google keep screenshots 1\" title=\"google-keep-screenshots-1.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"398\" />Google are great at keeping everything simple and easy to understand, doing a great job with the Keep app. Everything is controlled from a left hand menu accessed using the ‘hamburger’ icon in the top left. The design is very Googley, using their own material design but still following an iOS familiarity. The design won’t be to everyone taste, yet it holds a certain charm.</p>\n<p>The simple design allows it to handle reminders and todo lists perfectly. It is a breeze to add straight forward notes or customise them with Labels, reminders and colour schemes should you feel the need.</p>\n<p>It is surprisingly convenient to use, and in many ways punches well above it’s weight when compared to many todo apps. The app is also completely free which is a major bonus, considering the cost of most iOS todo apps seems to be £20+. You will need a Google account though, so nothing after that point is ever completely free.</p>\n<p>By setting up labels for Writing, Home and Work; heavy use of tick boxes and reminders I have managed to set up a use case that is very similar to my Todoist setup. If you are in two minds if to stump up the cash for a year of a power todo app it might be worth checking out Google Keep first. It could very easily save you quite a bit of money per year.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>Notes apps are a strange thing to review. Everyone already has one built into iOS, and the vast majority of people will never look anywhere else. I was one of those people until I was able to delete first party apps, and <a href=\"http://www.gr36.com/todoist-review/\">much like replacing reminders with Todoist</a> – I’ve replaced Notes with Bear. Here’s my review.</p>\n<p>By calling Bear a notes app it is much more approachable. When in reality it is a Markdown editor at heart. Allowing you to add in formatting while typing, for sharing later or simply for your own use. With a couple of key strokes you can add in links, headings, tick boxes, and even images. However if that is too much for your brain to remember there are shortcut buttons at the top of the keyboard.</p>\n<p>Whether you are jotting down a quick note to yourself, or starting a long page of prose, nothing will disturb your writing. Images can be inserted and formatted to your liking, meaning that as you type you will be looking at exactly how the document looks. This wont make a blind bit of difference to simple notes, but perhaps it’s time to take even your personal notes to the next level!</p>\n<h2><strong>Subscription Model</strong></h2>\n<p>Like many pro apps available now, Bear adopts the freemium model. The app is free on all platforms, with a monthly or yearly subscription to unlock pro features. Your use case may or may not need these features but they include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sync</strong> all your notes between Bear for iPad, iPhone, and Mac. Powered by CloudKit. Learn more about Bear’s sync and autosave in Organise and publish.</li>\n<li><strong>Export</strong> your notes to a variety of formats for publishing and sharing elsewhere.</li>\n<li><strong>Beautiful Themes</strong> – eight at launch, and more to come, to give you just the right, comfortable environment for your creativity to flourish.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are unlocked via a single subscription that covers all your devices, paid directly through the App Store. If you want to try out the Pro features you can claim a free week by signing up for the subscription, so you won’t be charged for the first week of use. So if you try it and don’t like the app, cancel before that time and you wont be chanted a penny.</p>\n<p>For the benefit of the review I will looking at the best version available, so I will be testing the Pro version. Bare this in mind during discussion of things like sharing if you don’t want to pay the £1.49 a month or £13.99 a year subscription. To me the subscription is well worth it for sync and the sharing options, but take this into account before jumping in.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"bear-review-premium-1-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/17549e07fa.jpg\" alt=\"Bear review premium 1 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"353\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>The Good Looking Notes App</strong></h2>\n<p>Rarely do you discus the design and UI of what appears to be such a simple. Yet Bear is one of the nicest to look at and simplest to use apps I have come across recently. Often the pretty facade quickly slips when you are searching for options or digging into menus to find things hidden for no good reason.</p>\n<p>Bear has been expertly designed in both aesthetics and function. All of your notes are listed on the left hand menu, which can be accessed with a right swipe. Once you are editing or looking at a note the developers have made all of the formation options available in a shortcut bar above the keyboard. This sounds a simple thing to do, but lots of others hide these away behind a formatting menu.</p>\n<p>Bear takes on exactly the same design in its companion Mac app, which is also available for free. The Mac app <a href=\"http://www.bear-writer.com/faq/Shortcuts/Mac%20shortcuts/\">supports loads of shortcut keys</a> but as yet doesn’t support any touch bar keys if you’ve updated to a 2016 MacBook Pro like I have. This is a shame, as other apps such as Ulysses has already pushed into this field, but it will only be a matter of time, so double check as they may have updated after publishing this review.</p>\n<p>You only realise what is lacking form other apps when an app does it right, instantly clicking and fitting into your workflow. Remembering shortcut keys is sometimes confusing, and they are never universal! So making shortcuts easily available makes it much easier when first writing in the app. You can of cause use CMD+ shortcuts on the iPad with an attached keyboard to.</p>\n<p>There are 8 different design options available in the app with more to come, including a dark mode for those that like using black. With that said design is more than just making things look pretty, as John Maeda says it is about meaningful results. The right balance of beauty and usability has been made here, the great design leads to a pleasing to use experience and an easy to understand menu and note organisation method.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"bear-review-screenshots-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0811410308.jpg\" alt=\"Bear review screenshots 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"398\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Tags</strong></h2>\n<p>If you already use a powerful note taking app or service you will more than likely already use tags profusely. Tags, or any kind of organisation features are drastically lacking from the stock app which is annoying because these features are what make taking notes in an app so useful. By adding a simple # in any part of your text you can link similar notes together without fuss.</p>\n<p>Bear will then list all these in the side of the menus, making them easy to edit and easy to find what you are looking for. Quickly falling into this practice as a writer is easy, with different publications linked and also tags for ideas and work in progress (WIP) articles.</p>\n<p>The use of the hashtag is instantly recognisable to an Evernote user, <a href=\"http://www.bear-writer.com/faq/?q=migrate\">you can even migrate all of your current notes pretty easily</a>. The hashtag also makes tagging your notes instantly accessible to all, pretty much every smartphone users know how they work.</p>\n<p>Users are also able to nest tags with ease, so organisational options really are limitless. By adding / to the tag you can organise until your hear is content. My article # now has article / ideas and a article / wip nested tags.</p>\n<p>What your notes app contains is really up to you, and something that is as unique as the apps you use to get things done. Some users purely want a note pad and nothing else. If that is the case Bear will offer you a much better method of organising your notes. However the subscription may be expensive purely for this.</p>\n<p>Whereas I use my notes to write out ideas for articles and later flesh them out into almost full posts. Because Bear offers me so much more in terms of exporting options I have instantly taken to it.</p>\n<h2><strong>Sharing</strong></h2>\n<p>Once agin the sharing options of this Notes app are right up there with a serious writing app. It offers the option for exporting the notes you have made in such a wide range of options it might take a while to work out which one you really need.</p>\n<p>Powerful exporting options are missing from a number of similar app, with many simply offering rich text exporting and some apps offer none! Where as there isn’t many options you would need that Bear doesn’t support. With a simple swipe left while viewing a note you can share in Text, Markdown, PDF, HTML, Rich Text, DocX and if that wasn’t enough you can even export as an image. No more screenshots of your notes to publish in Instagram and Twitter.</p>\n<p>This makes everything from writing stories to documents through to just jotting things down to remember a breeze. I have gotten into the habit of attaching PDF’s into Todoist tasks and also Fantastical appointments, simply because I can with relative ease.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"bear-review-landscape-1-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a95e5a17c2.jpg\" alt=\"Bear review landscape 1 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"298\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h1><strong>Deep Dive</strong></h1>\n<p>My habits of late have changed to delve a little deeper into my app reviews. Finding all manor of ways to use apps to their full ability. If you need a hand with what all of these terms mean, I will be writing a guide shortly. Safe to say you will need to <a href=\"http://www.gr36.com/how-to-get-started-with-workflow/\">invest in Workflow as a minimum</a> .</p>\n<p>The developers of Bear are taking iOS automation seriously straight from the start. Implementing loads of URL call back options. The format of Bear URL Scheme action are as follows</p>\n<pre><code>bear://x-callback-url/[action]?[action parameters]&amp;[x-callback parameters]\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are far too many things to go into and the extent you can customise quick launches and opening is huge. If you want to go through the full FAQ section and find all the <a href=\"http://www.bear-writer.com/faq/X-callback-url%20Scheme%20documentation/\">parameters head over to the Bear website</a> .</p>\n<p>Two schemes i have used considerably is the simple /open-note parameter</p>\n<pre><code>bear://x-callback-url/open-note\n</code></pre>\n<p>and also opening a specific tag – in my case my work in progress tag so I can see what needs some work on at any point.</p>\n<pre><code>bear://x-callback-url/open-tag?name=article/wip\n</code></pre>\n<p>These can be customised as much or as little as you require, but it is great to see developers spending so much time building in the requirements of power users like myself.</p>\n<h1><strong>Bear Verdict</strong></h1>\n<p>When I start reviewing a new iOS app that replaces a first party option I often ask myself if anyone is likely to use it above the stock app. The reality is that _<br /><em><em>most</em></em> users are never going to look for something different. However that is not to say that no improvements can be made.</p>\n<p>Bear is above and beyond a notes app, almost to the level that labelling it one is so far off the mark it is stupid. Bear is more along the lines of a writing app, it does more than many available Markdown editors. Being able to export and share things with ease, it would replace my old writing app of choice ByWord very easily.</p>\n<p>I have slotted Bear in between my current writing app of choice, Ulysses, and my brain. It gives me the ability to format and position text in a small light weight app before moving them to Ulysses for images and publishing. If you simply want a notes app that syncs to all your devices, then look no further than the stock app. If you are looking for something with as many power features as you can cram into an truly gorgeous looking app, then the small subscription is a no brainer.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "Todoist - My New App to Get Things Done",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>For as long as I can remember I’ve had a weird draw to organising things. It started with stationary and folders, and in the digital age expanded into spreadsheets and lists. I consider myself an organised person – yet one app has improved this further, <a href=\"https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327\">Todoist</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m not even going to pretend this app isn’t expensive. If you are not a big user of todo lists or you’re not looking for something to improve your productivity then this may not be the app for you.</p>\n<p>There is a free trial available though, download the app and sign up, then wait for the offer by email. It usually pops into your inbox after a day or so or <a href=\"https://doist.grsm.io/gregmorris5327\">sign up here for a free account</a>. This will give you a month of premium services, so you can sink your teeth into the app and decide if if outlay is worth it for your use case. With that said I haven’t been using Todoist very long, but have already signed up after a few days of getting my set up sorted!</p>\n<p>If you are serious about productivity then the £21.99 per year subscription model won’t be an issue for you. It is a shame you can’t spread the cost monthly like other services, but is works out less than £2 a month really. Premium services include some pretty great features so you won’t be disappointed. For the purpose of the review I will be covering Premium features and these include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Task Labels &amp; Reminders</li>\n<li>Location-based notifications</li>\n<li>Add tasks via email</li>\n<li>Attach files and comments to tasks</li>\n<li>Automatic backups</li>\n<li>Productivity tracking and charts</li>\n<li>iCal synchronization</li>\n<li>Project templates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Todoist is completely cross platform with 13 different apps available for various platforms, including a web sign in for everything else. This is a feature lacking from quite a few competing apps, allowing for a log in from any device. You can also collaborate on tasks should work colleagues or friends also use the app, they stand a good chance as Todoist currently has 3 million users.</p>\n<h2><strong>Sort Your Tasks</strong></h2>\n<p>For many years I have been using iCloud Reminders and Notes perfectly well. This is an excepts app and pretty good solution for most users, but Todoist turbo charges organisation and productivity. More than this it makes everything easy to understand. Breaking all your tasks down into Projects and allowing you to set labels and organise with filters.</p>\n<p>Not only is the layout of the app easy to understand, Todoist makes adding tasks a breese. The apps allows for entry of whatever it is you need to get done in natural language in a similar vain as one of my other favourite apps Fantastical. Setting up a task is as easy as inputting the description followed by when you want to do it e.g. “Publish new story tomorrow at 9am”. You can also attach this task to a Project by adding #project name and a Label by adding @label.<br /><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2017-10-24-Todoist-review-iphones-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c794feac6e.jpg\" alt=\"2017 10 24 Todoist review iphones 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"398\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Projects</strong></h2>\n<p>When opening the app the first things you will come across are Projects. Think of Project as an area in which the task falls into, these really should be called ‘groups’ or some <a href=\"https://medium.com/by-vernon/this-is-how-i-set-up-todoist-and-actually-gtd-3867e5e887a8#.eg67ygm5b\">people refer to these as ‘Buckets’.</a> These took me the longest time to get my head around, the name more than anything threw me off. Splitting tasks isn’t a unique thing for an app to do, however identifiers such as ‘home’, ‘work’ and ‘writing’ makes understanding them easier.</p>\n<p>Although you can set up projects however you wish. This could be used on an ad hoc basis for specific projects for project management, or used as I do just for a specific area. The amount of different options really are limitless, you can create sub-projects under main projects to ensure everything is organised and also implement colour coding to make everything easy to see.</p>\n<p>Inside the projects you place those pesky tasks that need to be completed. Giving them a description and customising them as much or as little as you like. You can structure sub tasks underneath them, you can leave comments on the task and even attach a range of files with ease. This is amazingly pretty unique for a task manager – most seem to support only pictures or voice recording. Whereas Todoist will allow images, text files, pdfs and many more.</p>\n<p>Tasks can also be given a priority, or Flag, dependant on how important they are. This will dictate where they appear in your lists. You can also set this by dragging and dropping tasks into the order you want them, or simply adding some Labels.</p>\n<h2><strong>Labels And Filters</strong></h2>\n<p>I made the mistake of rushing into Labels and thinking they would work the same as my Ulysses tag Workflow. However I found a bit of <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-ways-i-use-todoist-getting-things-done-gtd-brad-bush\">inspiration from the internet</a> and created different Labels dependent on time they would take. If I had a spare hour I could just look at that specific tag, meaning tasking could be squeezed into any spare time I had. Productivity x10!</p>\n<p>That really helps when you combine Projects and Labels into easy to view Filters. Filters allow you to easily see any task that fits into set criteria. You can set them for anything you wish by using Todoist advanced query system, combining them to make sure you only see what you need.</p>\n<p>For example I have set up filters for Writing tasks that are Labeled 10mins, so I can see anything that just needs a proof read. Or another for any tasks that really need to be done today – of cause coloured red and named URGENT!</p>\n<p>I have many overlapping filters that can pull anything that needs doing with a specific requirement. What’s more is that if my needs change, the app designers have made it so simple to create or edit filters it takes a few moments. Filters are really what has made tasks easy to see and finish when spare time occurs, rather than picking through iCloud reminders to see if I. Office anything I could do.</p>\n<h2><strong>More than you think</strong></h2>\n<p>Todoist also fills all the basic requirements, such as the ability to set reminders for tasks that need to be done at a certain date/time. Reminders can also be set for when you reach a certain location, so it’s easy to assign things that need to be done when out and about. Reminders could be set for simple things such as shopping requirements or just tasks you need to do as soon as you get home.</p>\n<p>If you miss a date or time, Todoist will even reschedule the task quickly and easily. Either automatically with a suggested best time to fit the task into your day. Or you can set it to another specific date/time with a couple of taps. Don’t worry about those recurring issues either as you can set the same task to come back or a regular basis. So the gym reminder won’t go away that easily if you don’t want it to!</p>\n<p>It is also worth mentioning that the app will sync all your Tasks, Project, Labels etc to all of the device you have. It does this quickly and solidly, with no fall out. I use Todoist on iPhone, iPad and two different Macs with flawless results. I keep bashing iCloud reminders, and in the most part I have had very little issues, but when they did occur tasks wouldn’t sync to other devices or they would just disappear completely.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"2017-10-24-Todoist-review-tick-1.jpeg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/26a9107f7b.jpg\" alt=\"2017 10 24 Todoist review tick 1\" width=\"599\" height=\"388\" border=\"0\" />The app also awards you ‘Karma’ for completed tasks. This has been heralded by some as a great incentive to create and complete tasks on time but hasn’t served any purpose for me. However if you like competing with yourself then you might find some motivation from it. For every completed task you are awarded some points, these combine to boost you up the five different levels.</p>\n<p>Right now I am sat at 1160 with a Novice label, however I have only been using the app a short while. The karma screen can be found at the top next your name, and does give you some good info about over due and completed tasks. If its annoying you can turn Karma off completely and the space will indicate how many task you have completed instead.</p>\n<h2><strong>Deep Dive</strong></h2>\n<p>With all of this said, they real beauty I have found in the app is its support for URL call back and <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/todoist\">IFTTT integration</a>. If you’re reading this section I’m pretty sure you already know what these can do for you, however it is nice to see such large development in the area.</p>\n<p>Macstories uncovered that Todoist <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/why-i-left-icloud-reminders-for-todoist/\">supports several undocumented URL scheme to help automate opening specific areas of the app</a>. To quickly see a weekly over view set up Launch Centre Pro or Workflow to open: <code>todoist://next7days</code></p>\n<p>To search for a task<br /><code>todoist://search?query=prompt</code></p>\n<p>Or quickly add a task<br /><code>todoist://addtask?content=prompt&amp;date=prompt</code></p>\n<p>This is also far from the limit, there is inbuilt support in AirMail to send emails straight to Todoist, which come in handy for tasks that you need to refer back to an email. The app also supports integration into Google calendar and iCloud calendar, so your tasks with a date can been seen in your appointments.</p>\n<h2><strong>Todoist Verdict</strong></h2>\n<p>With all the features outlined above the options for your set up really are limitless. All of them combine to make Todoist such a delight to use as an everyday tool. The interface is easy to understand and uncomplicated, which is the downfall of similar apps. With not too much work you can designate an area and a time frame to make sure you can cram all your tasks into any amount of time.</p>\n<p>The price may be a downfall for some, and it really is a shame they do not offer a monthly subscription option. However with the constant improvements and the ability the app has, if you have the cash consider the investment well worth it.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "Healthface - An Uncomplicated Apple Watch Complication",
				"content_html": "<p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>\n<p>I held out as long as I could, but I have now caved and bought a Series 2 Apple Watch. Not because it is anything revolutionary, not because I accidentally killed my original version (although I kinda did) but because health and fitness has become so important to me I feel the investment is worth it. I have also found a perfect complication to match my new Nike + version – Healthface.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately Apple still have not allowed third party watch faces, yet made a small compromise with adding in custom complications with watchOS 2.0. Some apps have embraced the concept and updated their apps to add in everything from weather to quick links into their apps.</p>\n<p>Yet very few apps have really invested in the idea of complications, and developed anything new. <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/uk/app/healthface/id1176374647\">Healthface by Crunchy Bagel</a> is an excellent and uncomplicated iOS app that displays health data on any accompanying Apple Watch.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"healthface-review-featured-1.jpg\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/38699d91b9.jpg\" alt=\"Healthface review featured 1\" width=\"500\" height=\"293\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<h2><strong><strong>Complications</strong></strong></h2>\n<p>The best part about the whole experience is the ease at which you can display a whole range of metrics right on your Apple Watch. Customise the amount of info displayed and place it on your watch face of choice in both a small or a large complication. Anything that is recorded in the health app can be displayed by Healthface on absolutely any watch face.</p>\n<p>I’ve stuck to the boring step count or mindful minutes depending on the watch face I am using at the time. Although you can set anything from vitals, to body measurements or even reproductive health depending on your requirements.</p>\n<p>All of the set up is done through the iOS app, by default displaying all of the available watch faces you can choose from. Tapping on a watch face displays the type of complications available. These vary lots dependant on the face, the Mickey Mouse face for example has a Utilitarian small and Utilitarian large available. Where as my weekend watch face, Numerals, only has the Utilitarian small available.</p>\n<p>You can then adjust which information you wish to be displayed and also customise how you wish it to be displayed. You can customise the unit of measurement and also any icons displayed in the complication. With a live preview of how the complication will appear at the top of the screen, as seen on the furthest right screen shot above.</p>\n<p>Once the design is perfected, then you can place the complication on your watch face using a long press (force touch) and selecting ‘customise’. However because of how watchOS works, this complication will be the same across all watch faces that use that particular complication size. Meaning that unfortunately you cannot have different info displayed on different watch faces if they use the same complication size.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"healthface-review-screenshots-1.png\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7c1a56554f.jpg\" alt=\"Healthface review screenshots 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"265\" border=\"0\" /><br />Tapping on the complication will open up a screen where the information can be refreshed. You will only need to do this when placing the complication or changing the data displayed. I have found myself pressing the complication by accident a few times, it is a shame this cant be locked somehow. Although this is all by design from Apple, so these types of changes are outside of the developer control.</p>\n<p>The real benefit of Healthface is putting your complications to work for you. Saving time digging into the Health app on your phone when you simply want to see a select piece of data you are keeping an eye on. Want to see your steps quickly and easily, no problem. Prefer to see your average heart rate – easy. The options are limitless and it’s great to see a developer using complications to make life easier.</p>\n<p>Healthface is available <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/uk/app/healthface/id1176374647\">for £0.79 from the app store</a>, if you’re serious about health it should be a must.</p>\n<p><!--kg-card-end: html--></p>\n",

				"title": "Defence H2O by X-Doria Review",
				"content_html": "<p>The constant need to make smartphones as thin and light as possible has made them fragile. So anti ‘lifeproof’ in fact that you have no choice but to put them into a case. Some manufactures are making their phones waterproof, but they still don’t survive a fall if the worst happens. Thats where X-Doria comes in, a long time producer of tough cases, with the Defence H2O it makes your phone waterproof too.</p><h1 id=\"defence-h2o-overview\">Defence H2O Overview</h1><p>The X-Doria Defence H20 Waterproof Protective Cover Case that I tested is for the iPhone 6/6s. X-Doria want you to be able to take your phone everywhere by making their Defence H2O case waterproof, snow proof, dirt proof and drop proof. That’s a lot of proofs, but can the case really protect my phone from anything?</p><blockquote><em><em>Jump in the puddles, dance in the rain, swim in the ocean! Don’t let the fear of soaking your iPhone stop you from enjoying your life. With X-Doria Defence H2O, savour every moment without the fear of drowning your device.</em></em></blockquote><p>The case can be bought from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/X-Doria-Defence-Waterproof-Protective-iPhone/dp/B0187LRV6E\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Amazon in the UK</a>, and also this give you a heavy discount. Taking the cost down from the £59.99 RRP to £34.26 for the black or £47.71 for the white version we tested. All of these prices may vary though and are correct at the time of review.</p><h1 id=\"design\">Design</h1><p>With any drop proof case you are always expecting it to really ruin the design of your phone. Although this isn’t the smallest case in the world, it is surpassingly thinner that expected. Leaving the iPhone still easily pocketable, and adding loads of grip to the phone which is a really bonus with the iPhone 6 being so slippery. For extra reassurance there is even a lanyard in the box.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/91ac831360.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"660\" height=\"400\" /></figure><p>The design uses a bumper around the sides that ‘exceeds military standards’ in drop tests of over 2m onto concrete, complimented by an almost perfectly clear polycarbonate back. So the Apple logo and the iPhone tramp stamp can still be proudly on show, but more importantly it still shows your colour of handset. Meaning your choice of Space grey, Silver or either Golds are not hidden away like many other cases.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/46055539df.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"660\" height=\"330\" /></figure><p>The bumper also covers all of the buttons to keep it nice and watertight, but doesn’t loose any of the reassuring ‘click’ when pressing. They do however need a little extra force to press them down, but I have had a much worse experience from much smaller cases. The bottom is covered by a rubber flap which plugs the headphone and charging port, allowing them to be used when required, but doing so obviously removes all of the ‘proofness’ highlighted above.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/e9932fbe93.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"660\" height=\"330\" /></figure><p>The Defence H2O also covers the screen with an inbuilt protector. It is surprisingly thick with a small gap between the cover and phone screen. Glare in direct sunlight is almost removed, but at the expense of viewing the screen is sometime slightly inhibited in some instances due to the thickens of the cover. Thankfully there are no issues with the touch sensitivity nor the Touch ID sensor.</p><h1 id=\"usage\">Usage</h1><p>I am a big believer in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2fL0SJ6\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">smartphone</a> cases, with my iPhone spending most of its life tucked inside the official leather case. What that doesn’t give me however is any protection, well against anything really. When our smartphones are now our lives why not get some protection when you need it. The X-Doria Defence H20 Waterproof Protective Cover Case is so easy to get on an off again, if you’re even half active this is the case you will need on stand by.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/b2045139d3.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"660\" height=\"400\" /></figure><p>In fact with the case only bumping the weight of an iPhone 6 to 176g, you may find yourself using it for all sorts of situations. When enjoying some craft time with the kids I didn’t need to worry about putting my phone out the way. Or equally when bathing the kids or even when washing up, I had zero phone worry at all. Remember those times when anyone could be dunked into the swimming pool at any time? Those times return when your phone has protection this good!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/acfb9e9e40.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"660\" height=\"400\" /></figure><p>When using the X-Doria Defence H20 your phone can be immersed in water at a depth over 2m for an hour. I am not sure what you would be doing to need such a long time, but it’s reassuring to know you’re covered. I think more than this though it makes your phone life proof, free from the worry over not just water but also dust and dirt. It is a must for almost every user even just for occasional use you are out and about.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/95d2487b81.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"660\" height=\"400\" /></figure><h2 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h2><p>With the only downside being the cost, at an RRP of £59.99 it is more expensive that you might want to spend. Particularly for an occasional use case. However weigh this up against the cost of a replacement handset and its excellent value.</p><p>Is this case for everyone? No – if you live a life of office work and not much else then the Defence H2O really isn’t for you. However if like me, your life is filled with kids, sports and being anywhere near water keep one of these on stand by.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>If you spend upwards of 12 hours a day in a wheelchair, there is one thing you need to be with it, which is happy. Some need extra padding, some need a new paint job and a few accessories to make it theirs. However that just wasn’t enough for 16 year old Mohammad Sayed, he demanded more.</p><p>Already <a href=\"https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/discover\">a student at NuVU in Cambridge</a>, Massachusetts, Mohammed was in the right place. Students at the ‘experimental high school’ reduce the traditional courses of English and math to complete several practice projects. Honing skills in more hands on subjects such as manufacturing, engineering and design. They have showcased projects producing alternative and more stable crutches and even a prosthetic hand that can write.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/4f388f3179.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" /></figure><p>So he set to work hacking and modifying his own wheelchair using his 3D printing and design skills to completely transform his chair. Along with a few classmates they built Mohammed everything he needed – adding on a Laptop tray and a canopy with accessible storage. However showing what is possible they redesigned the chair to be propelled by <a href=\"https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/studios/hacking-a-wheelchair/hand-drive#tab-final\">a rowing motion rather than the normal pushing</a>.</p><h2 id=\"rowing-wheelchair\"><strong><strong><strong>Rowing Wheelchair?</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>Now this may not be the first <a href=\"http://gogrit.org/lfc.html\">person to try a rowing wheelchair</a>, but they are the first to make the whole process ‘cheap’ and easily available. The students claim that each part of the conversion only costs around $3 to make, all that’s needed is the metal bar to row yourself to your destination. That being said the 3D printer will set you back a fair few digits from your bank balance.</p><blockquote>“If you are someone with atrophy and the muscles you would use to push with your biceps are getting weaker, allowing for different types of movement could mean the difference between continuing in a manual wheelchair or being forced to convert to a power wheelchair,” – Mohammad Sayed</blockquote><p>The design is enabled with a racket system that will enable movement both backwards and forwards, although this came with several headaches. “none of us are mechanical engineers, so we went with the guess-and-check method.” added Kate Reed, 16. A true feat when considering the age and experience of some of the students.</p><h2 id=\"pushing-further\"><strong><strong><strong>Pushing Further</strong></strong></strong></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/82765aab4c.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"wheelchair 3dprinted diagrame\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>The really shows the ability of the students given extra attention in different areas. Mohammed added that this experimental high school had helped him not just with his practical work. Sayed was open with what the school has done for him. “Before NuVu, I didn’t do well in groups, because as a creative person you always push your own ideas, Communication was sometimes a challenge, but now I’ve learned.”Projects such as this really do push things that are becoming more possible with easily available design software and a 3D printer. All of the work is being open sourced, so you could take the designs and convert your own chair with the help of a 3D printing company.</p>\n",

				"title": "Black Mirror Review: “White Christmas”",
				"content_html": "<p>Right from the outset it’s obvious that this is a <em><em>Black Mirror</em></em> Christmas special filled with roast turkey, tinsel and snow aplenty. Also obvious from the very first scene is that the opening frames are building to a very different kind of Christmas special. Taking a delve into the not too distant, but very real technology influenced, dark and decrepit modern society.</p><p>Smile, it’s Christmas! The time for drinks, family time and peace on Earth to all men. Well maybe not all men, as the two main protagonists (played by Jon Hamm and and Rafe Spall) are clearly escaping or sentenced to escape away from the life they once had. From here, Charlie Brooker takes his usual stab at everything from Google Glass, to social media and even modern slavery and torture.</p><p>I told you this was dark, but all wrapped up in the way Brooker seems to cloud everything – just enough so the story seems to work on more than one level. The feature length special wraps three stories around each other, beginning at funny, and carrying right through to downright freaky. The story telling, writing and cinematography makes no changes from the two other short series we have seen before. If you haven’t already, then go a watch now as from here on in there be spoilers!</p><h2 id=\"romance-coaching\"><strong>Romance Coaching</strong></h2><p>With wit, humor, and just a few white lies, Matt (Jon Hamm) begins to tell the story of of how he ended up in the place he is now. It’s narrated with all the silky smooth demeanor that his stereotypical American appearance conveys. Using his skills to coach what he describes as ‘dorks’, in this case Harry (Rasmus Hardiker), all while observing through “Eye­Link” all in the name of sex.</p><p>Providing jokes, motivation and a little stage fright in order to end the night in bed, they believe they have ‘hit the jackpot’ but the winning lady in this case, mistakes Harry talking to Matt as mental illness. When Harry aims to motivate her to do what the voices tell her by changing jobs she mistakes this for a suicide pact. So instead of spending the night between the sheets, they spend it dying on top of it, all whilst being observed by his ‘coach’ and anyone that has brought the footage. None are unwilling to get involved when the worst happens, raising questions to our current wearable technology, mental health issues and willingness to walk away rather than help someone in need.</p><p>When Matt’s wife is understandably unhappy when she discovers his involvement, we first see the best piece of social media critique ever as she blocks him.</p><h2 id=\"blocked-out\"><strong>Blocked Out</strong></h2><p>Booker has taken the simple block option on social media and pushes this to what could be a logical extension. The person blocked simply becomes a greyed out vistal entity. The block solves nothing, conversation cannot conclude and nothing is resolved, yet the world moves on. Moving on is inevitable, as Matt’s day job raises all sorts of questions on what constitutes a human.</p><p>Matt’s day job is automating the homes of those rich enough to pay for the service, in this case Greta (Oona Chaplin), by implanting a small chip (cookie) into a persons brain to absorb ‘themselves’. They then record everything that makes up their personality and everything they like into lines of code, making smart and snide remarks to almost tease the ‘copy’ of a person. Once removed, this ‘person’ is put to work in automating everything in the house.</p><h2 id=\"forced-emotion-and-rushed-story\"><strong>Forced Emotion and Rushed Story</strong></h2><p>Empathy for those imprisoned in the cookie is built fast with very real human reactions eradicated in a short period of time. The general tone and reactions from the story felt very forced and rushed. A human is not just their physical self, that goes without saying, but questions to Matt about the barbarity of his actions are forced aside quickly as if rushed. When Matt describes his technique of breaking ‘them’ in without snapping completely it felt as though this story could have should have been covered in an hour long episode alone. Just by using the word ’empathetic,’ Matt both insults and compliments.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/529221a3fb.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /></figure><p>That’s all before we even move onto poor Joe (Rafe Spall) and his tale of woe. Casting bright colours against a plain white dusting of snow, Joes story starts with actions and sounds of love and joy. With an appearance from the same song when everything goes wrong in the second episode of <em><em>Black Mirror – </em></em>an offbeat rendition of Irma Thomas’ “Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand).”</p><h2 id=\"old-faces-and-ideas\"><strong>Old Faces And Ideas</strong></h2><p>This throw back also marks the point where everything will seem very familiar if you have watched previous episodes. After Joe is blocked by his pregnant girlfriend, it descends into a mixtures of old episodes and characters. You see images of dancers on Hot Shots and even the comedy show that spawned Waldo.</p><p>After spending years being blocked and not being able to see his daughter, it is eventually rescinded when she dies in a rail crash, so Joe is finally able to set eyes on his daughter for the first time. From here on out its twists and turns that are not to be missed so I won’t spoil them here. The one-off episode is available on 4OD and also should be available on DirectTV in the US from the 21st onward. Merry Christmas!</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Round is cool. That’s just a fact – wheels, money, Oreos… they’re all brilliant. We’ve only seen two attempts at round Android Wear watches, and just one if you count the flat tyre of the Moto 360. Why there isn’t more, only manufacturers know. Most have adopted the safe haven of a square. So here we are, left with the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1GmJPB6\">LG G Watch R</a>.</p>\n<p>You can stop thinking that this is a round version of the original LG G watch right now. Thats a very wrong assumption to make, as much like the <a href=\"http://techaeris.com/2014/12/04/sony-smartwatch-3-review-the-best-android-wear-watch-at-the-moment/\">Sony Smartwatch 3 I tested last week</a>, it has received spec bumps and improvements in all the areas that you need. The <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1GmJPB6\">G Watch R</a> (GWR) is competing with the specs of the Sony watch, in what many consider hardware version 2 on Android Wear.</p>\n<p>Unlike the original G Watch, design has been very much on the minds of LG when working on the GWR. Instead of the plain Nexus like design, we get something that looks a top of the range sports watch, all be it a sports watch from the 1990’s, and those design cues are straight from G shock.</p>\n<h2 id=\"design-choices\"><strong><strong><strong>Design Choices</strong></strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Its almost annoying that the numbered dial around the outside doesn’t turn, so I can relive some youthful games of marking how much oxygen I had left. This does mean that, along with the Moto 360, it can actually be mistaken for a normal watch – something distinctly lacking from LG’s first model. Being more at home with a suit in the office with the Moto 360, than out running with the Sony Smartwatch 3.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e3a6043354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"819\" height=\"410\" /></figure>\n<p>The large bezel around the outside replaces the flat tyre look of the Motor 60, its actually a full circle! This does add a little bulk, and slightly inhibits you a bit when swiping cards away. Being a large margin above the 1.3-inch P-OLED display, the design makes the usual palm over the device a little more difficult. The display is noticeably smaller than the Sony Smartwatch 4, maintaining 320×320 dimensions, but colors are much more vibrant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"strap-life\"><strong><strong><strong>Strap Life</strong></strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Coming with a leather strap its hard to know where LG want to sit the styling of the watch. You would expect a watch taking all its design cues from sports watches to come with a high grade rubber strap like most of the competition. However the bundled leather strap is a confusing mix of sports and fashion, and with the leather wearing within a few days around the fastening and strap end its clearly not high grade leather.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9209c87239.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"819\" height=\"410\" /></figure>\n<p>That’s not all bad news as this leather wearing in does mean that after a few days use the strap is amazingly comfortable. Luckily the watch uses a standard 22mm watch strap so changing them for something new is easy. The only question that should be asked though is why should you have to? With the low grade leather its hard to see how they can justify the £220 price tag, given the Moto 360 come in at £199. It will be a tough choice to justify the extra outlay when comparing them side by side.</p>\n<h2 id=\"harder-to-kill\"><strong><strong><strong>Harder to Kill</strong></strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Given the choice on paper, many will chose the Moto 360. During use, the battery life increase on the GWR alone is worth a little extra outlay. The 410 mah battery consistently gets me through 2 days with moderate use – even the odd day of heavy use still saw me through to the next morning.</p>\n<p>Battery life on Android wear is a tough choice, the battery life needs to last through a tough day of heavy use, but does it really need to last more than that? We are a long way off anything last as long as the pebble, but I am fast coming to the conclusion that if the battery lasts more than a day, then it needs to last two – otherwise manufactures are just adding weight to spec sheets, for no real reason to the end user.</p>\n<h2 id=\"harder-to-like\"><strong><strong><strong>Harder to like</strong></strong></strong></h2>\n<p>There are certain products that just don’t have that special something, and that last little bit is missing from the G Watch. It doesnt feel like a step forward, despite the improved display and battery, it just feels like a round version on the first generation hardware – all be it with much better looks and a much better battery.</p>\n<p>The battery charger, although easy to use, is a proprietary piece of hardware I have to worry about. So anytime I spend traveling I have to make sure I know where this small bit of plastic is. Though I am sure this won’t suffer the same fate as my Gear Live charger, more manufacturers need to offer at least a back up of the basic micro USB connection.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2f2434d94f.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"819\" height=\"410\" /></figure>\n<p>It does however feature a heartrate sensor, that seems to be much more accurate than others on the market. Unlike the Gear Live I can use it after a run and whilst damp. Despite the graphing ability in Google Fit, we are still lacking the ability to record it at intervals through out the day.</p>\n<p>The lack of an ambient light sensor was also a big draw back after using the SW3 and Moto 360 as it means the screen is either on or off, which is constantly annoying. Luckily the 5.0 update to Android Wear has fixed this little issue (but more about that another time). The recent update however, has yet to fix all the small announces with the screen.</p>\n<p>When the screen dims after covering of after a period of inactivity, the screen fades all the way to black, only to brighten back up to the dim screen. If the screen then turns on the face will jump slightly, very noticeable due to the high contrast colour on the screen. Again a small annoyance, but ruining the experience of the most expensive Android watch on the market ever so slightly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><strong><strong><strong>Conclusion</strong></strong></strong></h2>\n<p>If styling is the most important factor to you and you want a full circle Android Wear smartwatch, there is only one watch to choose from. For a good looking Android Wear watch without the battery anxiety of the Moto 360, choose the G Watch R. But for all the round ability on the G Watch R, it falls short of living up to Android Wear hardware v2. Given the expensive outlay be sure the styling is for you, as it will soon be outdated with new hardware incoming.</p>\n",

				"title": "Sony Smartwatch 3 Review",
				"content_html": "<p>It feels much longer, but it’s been less than 6 months since Android Wear hit the market. They have stealthily crept into use without much fuss, despite revolutionising the wearables market. Reducing the time spent interacting with your phone, but still mining all of that lovely data for Google. The launch devices were pretty average, the Moto 360 wasn’t for everyone despite its anticipation. So now its time to see, perhaps one of the more experienced smart watch maker, Sony take on Android wear. The Sony Smartwatch 3 review is straight ahead.</p>\n<p>Despite claiming they had no intention of making a watch for Android Wear, they have followed up two generations of Sony Smartwatch running their own OS, with a third – this time running Android Wear. The imaginatively titled ‘Sony Smartwatch 3’ has the same rugged lifestyle proof ratings that their phones do. Each Android watch has been water resistant, but the SM3 sports an IP68 rating mean you can submerge it in water for up to 30 minutes, should you feel the need.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5ec5954780.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" /></figure>\n<p>The IP68 rating means you can leave the watch on when going about your daily life and it will stand up to everything – swimming, running, working and even the occasional bump and scrape can all be shrugged off, although you will still suffer the phantom touches from water that have plagued every model so far.</p>\n<h2 id=\"design-for-many\"><strong>Design For Many</strong></h2>\n<p>With its basic, no nonsense name echoed in its design (that in many ways takes on Google’s Nexus design language), it isn’t going to win any design awards – but what some people may call boring and plain others will call understated and sleek. In certain light conditions on the black model, it’s sometimes impossible to tell where the screen ends and the band starts.</p>\n<p>Choose any colour band you like, but they all are made of the same high quality rubber, with a matte finish. Matched with a clasp similar to that of a normal fashion watch, you have the making of foolproof comfy fitting. Unfortunately this is the sole area that lets the Smartwatch 3 down, and does it quite badly.</p>\n<p>For want of better words, the fit is not going to be for everyone. The clasp is very big and a little loose matching this to there being too much space between notches, the fit can occupy that annoying space between one setting being too tight and the next too loose. Combine this with the flat ‘core’, it fits much like the LG G Watch rather than the much comfier Gear Live.</p>\n<p>Of course everyone’s wrists are going to be different, so a try before you buy is recommended as the fitting may not be for everyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lifestyle-proof\"><strong><strong><strong>Lifestyle Proof</strong></strong></strong></h2>\n<p>Dust resistance may be a box that doesn’t need to be ticked, but anything to life proof it can only help. What that does mean is that everything is sealed into the watch, but its not actually a watch per se. The main body pops out to reveal what Sony call ‘the core’. This can then be swapped into other bands, and presumably other things, but until now there is just a white, yellow or a pink rubber band to choose from.</p>\n<p>If they could match this to a metal and/or a leather option, you would have a look for every occasion. However, achieving this Android Wear for work and play may be down to Google improving the speed in switching wearables, with manufacturers eventually releasing easily changeable watch bands to rival the yet unreleased Apple Watch.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/eb46ed0e77.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" /></figure>\n<p>This core charges using a standard mini USB cable, so ditches the docks and proprietary chargers that others have needed. Which makes a very welcome change, as some of these have caused issues. The IP rating means, much like the Sony phones, is covered up with a rubber flap. Which the longevity of which remains to be seen, but gaining access to the connection is easy to achieve, much more than messing around with a required dock or connector.</p>\n<h2 id=\"improved-ability\"><strong><strong><strong>Improved Ability</strong></strong></strong></h2>\n<p>The comparison to other Android watches unfortunately has to carry on, as with the Sony watch we could be at the start of v2 of the hardware. No bold and revolutionary changes are seen with the Smartwatch 3, but how many improvements can be made to a watch? Everything sees a much needed improvement to the areas that really matter.</p>\n<p>The screen is the same 1.6 inches we have seen before, with a new ‘Transflective Display’ providing the 320×320 display.  This fancy technology means that while the screen isn’t as vibrant and colourful as that seen on the Moto 360, you can see it clear and accurately in even the brightest of sunlight. A fantastic improvement to what was the biggest gripe of the first wave of Android Wear watches.</p>\n<h2 id=\"spec-bumps\"><strong><strong><strong>Spec Bumps</strong></strong></strong></h2>\n<p>The battery receives a small bump to 420mah, which hardly seems a huge deal given the LG watch had 400mah when it hit the shelves. With improvements to the screen and internals, the claimed 2 days of battery life is easily achievable. Where a day of use had me needing the charger at 7pm with the Moto 360, i’m easily able to resist the charging cable for more than 48 hours with the Smartwatch 3.</p>\n<p>This is the first Android smartwatch based on the Broadcom SoC platform, packing a 1.2GHz Quad-core ARM Cortex A7 processor and its own on board GPS Sensor allowing for phone free tracking if needed. Along with off live music playback through Bluetooth headphones – thanks to the updated Android Wear OS, you could run phone free if you needed.</p>\n<p>The watch also has built in wifi, all be it lying dormant while the Android Wear support lacks support. A future update may mean phone free updating too, should Google wish to take Android wear down that street. Android Wear on the SM3 is in stark contrast to that seen on the Gear Live. Rather than duplicating or replacing every wear app, the SM3 is completely stock, save for a few watch faces that are actually very well designed. Usefulness and ability is the same as any other Android Wear watch currently on the market… if you have used one you have used them all.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9558d7f828.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" /></figure>\n<p>All being said this is by and far the best Android Wear watch on the market at the moment. There are improvements to be made in comfort, but the ability and usability from the thought Sony has put in more than makes up for it. It would be hard to choose this over the Moto 360 or even the G Watch R for styling, but the all round ability of Sony’s Smartwatch 3 is second to none.</p>\n",

				"title": "My Frustrating Journey To Replace A Bent iPhone",
				"content_html": "<p>You’ve read the few stories floating around, you’ve seen <a href=\"http://techaeris.com/2014/09/24/iphone-6-bendgate-control-heres-internets-best-responses/\">our round up of ‘#Bendgate’</a>, and you’ve even watched some fools bend iPhones on YouTube only to dismiss the issue just like I did. It wasn’t until I discovered my own iPhone was bent that I started to believe those YouTube bending fools. It’s not as bent as some iPhone 6 Pluses I have seen mind you, but when placed face down it certainly doesn’t sit flat.</p><p>From day two I’ve had the phone sitting in its nice official leather case living out its quiet life in my hand, in my pocket, or on my desk. So how exactly can my phone bend in its short quiet life? Your guess is as good as mine.</p><p>I went into this this frustrating journey of replacing my bent iPhone filled with confidence that it would be a simple issue of getting the phone replaced after a few calls, but I couldn’t have been more wrong.</p><h2 id=\"%E2%80%98cpw-cares%E2%80%99\"><strong><strong><strong>‘CPW Cares’</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>The number of phones in stock would be my first major hurdle. Considering Apple has sold so many iPhone 6s in the short time they’ve been out, they may be in short supply and make it harder to get an exchange. I figure calling the store I purchased the iPhone 6 from was my best bet to check and see if they have stock and explain my situation. Forty minutes later of being on hold and I’m beginning to think going to the store is best option. Not a huge deal, having worked there in the past, thinking this would be easy.</p><p>When I arrived, the store manager checked to see if I was ok after waiting less than five minutes, but unfortunately I still ended up leaving the store empty handed. He quickly informed me that I would have to go an Apple store, the nearest of which is three to four hours of driving away, even after I told him that I only had the phone for a little over a week.</p><p>“Out of our hands” he told me, “it’s not faulty so it’s your problem”. Strange thing for him to say when he hadn’t even set eyes on the handset. Below (and above) is a picture illustrating the ‘not faulty’ iPhone.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/cbc2136e8b.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" /></figure><p>I even went as far as pointing out the fact that under UK Law, 11N of The Supply of Goods and service act (1982) states that responsibility is placed firmly at the retailer’s door. This information didn’t even raise more than a grunt from the scruffy supercilious manager.</p><h2 id=\"please-hold-your-call-is-important-to-us\"><strong><strong><strong>Please Hold, Your Call Is Important To Us</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>Right or not, I presumed that one store manager didn’t speak for the business, so thought it best to try a little higher up the chain. I called the Carphone Warehouse Customer care number who, despite the name, didn’t seem to care at all.</p><p>I was assured that “Apple has put the phone through rigorous testing and it requires a large amount of force…” but I tuned them out after that. The nice lady went off to see what my options were and informed me when she returned after ten minutes that I could take it back to the store and they will send it to Apple (which could take up to three weeks) or I could take it myself.</p><h2 id=\"applecare\"><strong><strong><strong>AppleCare</strong></strong></strong></h2><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/af938d3a13.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Apple logo icon\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>I called my mobile network (o2) and they said they would be happy to exchange the handset but, since I bought it from CPW, there was nothing they could do. Resigned to the fact I am going to have to sort things out myself, I suppose fours hours out my day is not the worst thing in the world. I have since booked an appointment at the Apple Store in Sheffield on Tuesday, so hopefully that will be the end of my journey.</p><p>This whole experience has left me feeling like it’s me that has the issue, or that I’m crazy and just being too picky. I am most of all annoyed, not at the phone, but at at the service seeing as the issue should have been sorted after one hour and not several days. These are the considerations you must take into account when buying a phone from now on.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>It was Sony that first started the the conspiracy around killing your device when they wanted you to upgrade. The fabled <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_timer\">‘Sony timer’</a> stopped the tech from working days after the warranty expired, making you upgrade to newer hardware. Now the theorist have moved onto Apple.</p><p>The anecdotal <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/upshot/hold-the-phone-a-big-data-conundrum.html?_r=2\">evidence has been that Apple intentionally</a> slows down the old version of the handset when launching a new version to force you to think about upgrading. This whole concept is called ‘planned obsolescence’ or the un-coincidental demise of a device.</p><p>It seems that some credence has been handed to the theory by a new Harvard study from economics student Laura Trucco. Trucco looked at the amount of people searching for phrases such as ‘iPhone Slow’ when a new version of the handset is launched.</p><p>What Trucco found is actually pretty substantial from such a simple study. Whenever a new iPhone is released, search phrases relating to slowing down of the older version skyrocket. What’s more, this is not coincidental and searches relating to Android handsets such as ‘Galaxy s3 slow’ did not increase in correlation to a new device launch. Simply increasing over time as more are sold.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/f8e315b067.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"702\" height=\"336\" /></figure><h2 id=\"expectation-led\"><strong>Expectation Led</strong></h2><p>The implication is that Apple somehow slows down the device to make the user more likely to upgrade to a new handset when the slowdown may be just lead by expectation. If you watch the new device launch and they boast about how the new model is twice as fast, your current model is going to feel slow.</p><p>The slowdown is an unavoidable occurrence as Apple attempts to make the newer model software feature as much new ability as possible. As the new version of software is adopted by users of older handsets, they are less able to cope with the new features, and as such run much slower.</p><p>One thing Apple is great at is new software adoption after launch, while an Android handset may have several months before it is able to receive a version of the newest iteration of Android. After all Apple controls both hardware and software, enabling them to work much more quickly and have more control than Android manufactures.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/c5cb94754a.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"702\" height=\"336\" /></figure><h2 id=\"fragmentation\"><strong>Fragmentation</strong></h2><p>An Android device may not receive an updated Android version for months after release if at all. Even then this release will not reach all users at once.  It will be slowed by differing manufactures, different version of the device and also network testing. So if the same issues do take place on Android handsets it would not show the spike that Apple handsets do.</p><p>However there are advantages to this model. If an Android handset was unable or not able to run a new feature well, this feature would be left out of the update or simply the handset would not be updated. Sure as each integration of iOS and Android is released it become more and more taxing on the internals of older devices.</p>\n",

Many have come and satisfied me for a short while, but there is always a compromise somewhere. Whether it be poor battery life, poor camera, or poor software, the reasons are many. The next in this line is the marmite device, the OnePlus One.</p>\n<p>Love it or hate it, you can’t avoid talk of the OPO. If it’s not a vocal few voicing opinions on the marketing, it’s the many more begging for an invite to buy the phone. Even after ordering the phone it still divides people.

How did you get one!” to “what on earth is that phone” in equal amounts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"unboxing-is-an-experience\"><strong>Unboxing Is An Experience</strong></h2>\n<p>Be prepared for the whole experience of the phone that start from the shipping box.

The build quality of the phone trumps any plastic put out by the majority of manufacturer. It falls short of the level of the HTC One M8, but these two ‘ones’ are top of the tree in build.</p>\n<p>What OnePlus have done is spent the money on the device in some strange areas. Considering the key ring Sim-ejector tool, the amazing quality USB lead and the deluxe packaging. Then put these against the two adaptors I have to use just to plug it into the wall. Leaves a few questions of the importance placed on usually unimportant areas, but the areas that do matter do not disappoint.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hands-on\"><strong>Hands On</strong></h2>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1d14a331a4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"351\" /></figure>\n<p>I said it in the initial hands on this phone is big in the hand.

After a week of use the backing of the sandstone black handset has lost some of its gritty feel but none of the grip, now resembling a feel similar to rough felt. Making it feel great to the touch, strong and reassuringly sturdy.</p>\n<p>Dominating the front of the phone is the 5.5 inch screen. I said this phone was big didn’t I? The Screen produces colours that are bright and vivid, if a little on the warm side. Not to mention the level of tweaking options available will make any user happy. Combining this with the sound from the twin speakers, everything from a full movie to a quick YouTube clip is engrossing. Even if the sound is blasted sideways and not forwards which you get from the Sony Z2 and HTC One M8.</p>\n<h2 id=\"spec-sheet-war\"><strong>Spec Sheet War</strong></h2>\n<p>Is it possible to see any stutter from devices anymore? Modern powerhouses of processors make light of easy tasks. The OPO is no exception, the Snapdragon 801 doesn’t even break a sweat to keep usage fluid and response. With gaming and extensive tasks bringing out the best in the chip.</p>\n<p>Even the most graphic and process intensive activity is a breeze. Combine this with 3GB of ram for all your multitasking pleasures. One advantage of such a large handset is space to fill with battery power. So even a day of heavy use will be no issue for the 3100mah battery. Getting in excess of 6 hours screen on. Of course your millage may vary.</p>\n<p>The only let-down is the screen is not a responsive as I would like. Spending a good ten minutes working out if it was my imagination or just that anything after the latency on the M8 feels like a step backwards. Leaving the on screen navigation keys sometimes a little under responsive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"push-the-button\"><strong>Push The Button</strong></h2>\n<p>If you choose to make use of the full screen real estate and switch to the capacitive buttons be prepared for them to disappoint. Being the wrong way around and also extremely poorly backlit. A non-issue once you get used to them. Which may take a while as after all they are the wrong way around!</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f8d68e3519.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"527\" /></figure>\n<p>Whereas the power and volume buttons are in the perfect position on such a large phone. Right in the middle of either side. They are good quality buttons with a reassuring click when pressed. However they are a little too far recessed into the phone. Making it slightly hard, and almost impossible when using a case.</p>\n<p>It’s a little disappointing they didn’t to add a camera shutter key, if only to take up a bit more room on the side of the phone. This is where the quick launch gestures come in handy right? Well we will get to that soon enough.</p>\n<h2 id=\"snap-happy\"><strong>Snap Happy</strong></h2>\n<p>Android Phones have always appeared to lag behind both the iPhone and Windows phone devices. Only until the current generation have we seen those that really compete on this level. OPO reviews have shown some great staged photos that appear to be taken by a high quality camera. In reality the ability of Sony’s Exmor IMX214 13-megapixel shooter is left lacking more than it should.</p>\n<p>In anything other than perfect light it sometimes takes a couple of shots to get a great finished article. Which is normal when comparable to anything other than a Lumia at the moment. The CMOS sensor includes a great f/2.0 aperture, so in low light when it really matters the ability is good. Let down by poor software processing however. Leaving some photos noisy and washed out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"next-camera\"><strong>Next Camera</strong></h2>\n<p>What pulls everything back together is the ‘Next Camera’ that comes stock on the OPO. The CM team has really worked on this to really show their ability. The capture rate is nothing short of incredible. Meaning I can fire off shots in amazing speed. Giving the HTC M8 a good run for its money you rarely missed the shot you want.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/885d88e1fd.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"395\" /></figure>\n<p>When shooting there are several filters to choose from with a swipe of the finger before shooting. These give the impression of pleasing the Instagram generation. What this does do is reduce the time to enter HDR mode to half the time of other apps. When using HDR expect the processed shots to be over exposed and sometimes unnatural. Giving results that appear to be from someone learning to Photoshop. There are two included in the gallery above.</p>\n<p>Francois the audio and camera developer at Cyanogen has <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/117443191357357631171/posts/WvtREUY8TUB\">also shown that there are big</a> improvements coming for the OPO, including RAW support. So there is a benefit to having constant development by CM. However some of the other software leaves a little to be desired.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cyanogen-misses-the-mark\"><strong>Cyanogen Misses The Mark</strong></h2>\n<p>This is one area that has been left lacking. I have very rarely used Cyanogen before the OPO. Although the amount of users that speak highly of the ROM developer goliath is outstanding. Even on a Nexus device there appear to be bugs and unfortunately the OPO version CM11s is no different.</p>\n<p>Nothing had been detrimentally wrong. However software features that don’t work on an end user device is unacceptable. Software fixes for a pretty big bug with the Wi-Fi toggle when using a theme has still not been applied to the ‘flagship killer’, despite being available for weeks in other software.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5ff95f319a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"336\" /></figure>\n<p>As soon as you turn the device on I would turn the wake up gestures and double tap to wake off. Otherwise you risk turning on the torch or unlocking the phone in your pocket. I don’t think this version of CM11s would even class as a milestone build. A fix is coming so we have been told.</p>\n<p>I realise that at the moment the OPO is aimed at those more ‘tech savvy’ than the average consumer. That’s a very good job because a normal consumer would not put up with CM11s as it is today. If OnePlus ever want to move forward they need to seriously consider doing so without Cyanogen on board. Or stepping their game up dramatically before they even consider releasing a general consumer handset.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-tweaker%E2%80%99s-dream\"><strong>A Tweaker’s Dream</strong></h2>\n<p>What CM11s does bring to the table is an almost endless array of personalisation tweaks and modifications. Far too many to go into detail here but expect favourites like customisable navigation bar, quick settings, and shortcut gestures. Meaning you can select as many or as few as you like.</p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img class=\"kg-image\" src=\"https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4bdd85ec92.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"356\" /></figure>\n<p>What is amazing for customisation is Cyanogen’s new theme manager. The ability to change everything from boot animations and icons, to full on themes that change almost every pixel of Android. With hundreds of themes available straight from the Playstore. Want it to look like Android L, no problem. Even themes to implement LG or Touchwiz design if that’s your thing.</p>\n<p>Cyanogen also bring along their security options to the OPO. The phone is not rooted out the box, so using banking apps and the like are not an issue. The stock kernel has bene patched to a much secure level than most devices available today. And with Whisper SMS you can encrypt your text messages with ease.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tldr\"><strong>tl;dr</strong></h2>\n<p>Removing the software bugs I am in love with this device. The build quality and battery life are truly a wonder to behold. Using it will be enjoyable, once you are used to the size of the handset.</p>\n<p>Whilst the screen is not pushing the pixels of the G3, it is bright and vivid. Combined with great sound from the speakers makes for great media consumption. The camera software is great combined with a good sensor. Which will only get better.</p>\n",

				"title": "Notification Heads Up! Cyanogen Uncover New Feature",
				"content_html": "<p>We are now a mere day away from Google I/O, where Google is rumoured to be launching a new version of Android. What isn’t known is whether it will be Android 4.5 or 5.0. Not content with that Google have launched both 4.4.3 and 4.4.4 to AOSP and Nexus devices. However, a new threat has been discovered whilst digging around inside the fresh source code. <a href=\"https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/dbccd44a638ae8705a5b14bff8b2dd74abc26045/packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/statusbar/policy/HeadsUpNotificationView.java\">Cyanogen team members have uncovered a new notification feature</a> called ‘Heads Up’. The CM team have managed to switch on the hidden code and implement it into their ROM.</p><p>This creates a notification similar to that implemented by the Paranoid Android Team with their ‘Hover’ feature. Created with immersive mode in mind, a notification does not disturb full screen activity. Instead creating a floating replication of the notification just below the status bar. These can be interacted with in the normal way, expanded or dismissed. All without having to leave your app or pull down the notification shade.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/189573ff9c.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"702\" height=\"702\" /></figure><h2 id=\"notification-heads-up\">Notification Heads Up</h2><p>Starting with the <a href=\"http://www.cyanogenmod.org/blog/last-week-in-cm-jun-19-2014\">CM ‘nightly’ from June 21st onwards</a>, Heads Up will be available to use. CM has not only switched on the feature, but implemented it with the notifications, system wide. All with the level of expertise we have come to know from the team. If there are some notifications you just don’t want to see in heads up. There is an option to switch off certain apps from doing so. Leaving only the important ones to make a bigger, bolder entrance onto your screen.</p><p>Full of intrigue we have tested out the brand new notification Heads Up. Testing out the feature in the June 21st ‘nightly’ for the Nexus 5, Nexus 7 and even the <a href=\"http://techdissected.com/editorials-and-discussions/two-weeks-with-the-htc-one-m8/\">HTC One M8</a>. There are a few teething issues, but other than small issues, this works exactly as you would expect. You can interact with a notification in all ways you would expect. Tap to launch the app, swipe away or even use embedded interaction options. It has already proven to be useful in the short time testing. So much so that CM11 has now become my rom of choice.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/327d7a616e.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"702\" height=\"702\" /></figure><p>We can only speculate if these are meant to be used in the next version of android, or maybe never due to be used in android. They bear more than a passing resemblance to iOS notifications. With iOS8 to get interactive notifications, maybe this is an area Google will be pushing forward. Ready to stay one step ahead of iOS.</p><h2 id=\"don%E2%80%99t-want-to-flash\">Don’t Want To Flash?</h2><p>Don’t worry if you don’t want to flash CM for the notification features. <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/mod-heads-notifications-t2791217\">MohammedAG over on XDA Developers</a> has ported the feature over to Xposed. Joining such modules as <a href=\"http://techdissected.com/google/gravity-box-the-all-in-one-xposed-framework-module/\">gravity box</a>, it offers custom rom like features to an otherwise stock rom. However you will have to root. In the interests of science we tried this on other roms and it works great on AOSP based roms. On non AOSP such as HTC Sense it does work very well. But misses some notifications. Remeber this is only v.1 of the notification enhancement so I am sure it will improve.</p><p>We are going to see an action packed I/O this year. <a href=\"http://techdissected.com/google/lg-g-watch-and-android-wear-what-do-we-know/\">Android Wear and the LG G Watch</a>, <a href=\"http://techdissected.com/google/android/google-fit-to-be-released-at-google-io/\">Google fit</a>, <a href=\"http://techdissected.com/google/android-tv-report-says-its-set-to-launch-at-io-2014/\">Android TV</a> and what else. Maybe a new tablet with a new version of android? Maybe Android Silver? The Keynote starts at 9am PDT on June 25th. With the key note and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.samples.apps.iosched\">several sessions streamed online</a> for those that are unable attend. In 2014 everything leaks! Somehow Google always manage to surprise us with something, what would you like to see?</p>\n",

				"title": "OK Google: Where Do We Go Now?",
				"content_html": "<p>In the 16 years <a href=\"http://google.com/\">Google</a> has been active the world, along with its business model, has dramatically changed. The small start up aimed to streamline internet users experience, is now one of the worlds largest corporations. At its heart it still wants to be a start up. Google is still a search company, but its reach has grown so far there is barely an industry without its involvement.</p><p>But where can Google possibly go to now. With advertising revenues projected to decline as users become more aware of them. The vast majority of Google’s income may dry up. It must grow and evolve to maintain its dominance. Or suffer the same fate that have happened to huge companies before. So OK Google, where to next?</p><h2 id=\"search-and-adverts\">Search And Adverts</h2><p>It was the idea that started it all. Sure search existed before but other systems used simple ranking by how many times the search term appeared on the page. Ranking pages by a simple count. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, whilst studying at Stanford, researched a better system taking in account the relationships between websites. And PageRank was born, making decisions on the page relevance and importance of pages.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/2eb39a9239.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"702\" height=\"57\" /></figure><p>Google is still very much rooted in search, most of its services make Google search and services prevalent. Gmail for example, is one big contextual search of your inbox. Leading to the appeal of a service that is faster and easier to use than competing services. No user of Android can avoid the search bar on the launcher, and Google search capabilities are the root of the new Android Wear and Android TV.</p><p>It’s maintained its core business, now leading the competitors by more than <a href=\"http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Market-Rankings/comScore-Releases-May-2014-US-Search-Engine-Rankings\">triple the number of search users</a>. This means only one thing for Google, Adverts. Ad revenue accounts for the vast majority of Google’s income. Still managing to <a href=\"http://investor.google.com/earnings/2013/Q4_google_earnings.html\">increase ad clicks and cost per click</a> year on year. With Google search able to display ads to you that are relevant to not just your search. But you as an individual. Make a search for a product and you mite be chased around the internet by an ad for it for weeks.</p><p><em>We show that brand-keyword ads have no measurable short-term benefits. For non-brand keywords we find that new and infrequent users are positively influenced by ads. But that more frequent users whose purchasing behaviour is not influenced by ads account for most of the advertising expenses. Resulting in average returns that are negative.Consumer Heterogeneity and Paid Search Effectiveness: A Large Scale Field Experiment</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/0a3cb43535.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"702\" height=\"336\" /></figure><p>But research by <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w20171.pdf\">eBay may just be able to quantify</a> the falling advert success. The opinion that users don’t click on search and Adsense adverts any longer seems to be true. Advertisement techniques grow and change over time. From radio and TV adverts, to online banners ads to now targeted adverts. Users eventually become ‘immune’ to the effects. Where will Google be without ads?</p><p>Lets not forget it doesn’t just make money from its own ads. It makes them from ads all over the internet and mobile. Ever accidentally clicked an advert whilst playing Angry birds or similar. Thats making money not just for the developer, but for Google too. After taking 30% off the cost of paid apps, it also takes a slice of anything made from placed ads or in app purchases later on too.</p><h2 id=\"android\">Android</h2><p>The operating system that almost didn’t see the light day day is now more than 80% of the total market. As of March 2013 there were 1 billion Android devices in use. And another 1.5 million devices activated every single day. Each device primed to sell not only applications, music and films. But also Google services such as Gmail, Google plus and Google search. Storing masses of user data including location, usage and interests. All ripe for serving directed mobile advertising.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/e2e4623c3a.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"702\" height=\"142\" /></figure><p>Android OS cost millions to develop and bring to life. And further millions each year to keep constantly updating and pushing the OS to keep pace with competition. Google then gives this all away for free through open source. Now this isn’t a debate on how open Android really is, but the fact is millions each year developing is given away for free. All in the hope of making it back through other avenues.</p><p>The use of Android also ties users into using other Google services. It provides them with a Gmail address and a Google plus account. Not to mention services such as Google Drive and  Calendar. All in the hope of gaining data to display ads. This must be working for Google as its pushing for the next billion from emerging markets <a href=\"http://techdissected.com/google/android/android-one-pushing-for-the-next-billion/\">with Android One</a>. As well as exploring where else it can put adverts. Creating unique hardware to gain more and more users for Android.</p><h2 id=\"google-content-everywhere\">Google Content Everywhere</h2><p>The best way from Google to do this is to put Android on every screen you own. Launching Android Wear, Android TV and even Android Auto at <a href=\"http://techdissected.com/news/google-io-2014-day-one-recap-android-all-the-things/\">Google I/O 2014</a>. Google will be on more screens and own more services than ever before.</p><p>There is no adverts placed on Android Wear at the moment, although that may change in the future. Its aim is to gain more user data and lock users into Android further. Where as <a href=\"http://techdissected.com/google/android-tv-more-than-just-a-smart-tv/\">Android TV is aimed to gain a</a> reliable and consistent income from media. Providing Google Movies and TV along with Google Music.</p><p>In a similar move to its Play Music All Access service. It is only a matter of time before Google goes after subscription services such as Netflix. However even competitors such as Spotify have struggled to make profit at all. <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-growth-not-making-big-183316270.html\">It now has over 10 million subscribers</a>. Yet still falls in the red.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/e6bae15266.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"702\" height=\"331\" /></figure><p>So moves into content and media may just be to pull an Apple. Tie users into as much content as possible so its harder to switch platforms. Gathering as much data as possible in the mean time. Google is very willing to develop technology to serve its ends. That being displaying adverts. Spending billions in research to provide something new. Putting ads on your thermostat, watch and even right to your eye with Google Glass. Is all a possibility given opportunity.</p><h2 id=\"google-likes-its-labs\">Google Likes Its Labs</h2><p>Also not shy of spending some of its cash reserves. Google has been purchasing companies in varying fields for some time. It acquired Nest Labs for $3.2 billion to strengthen its push into bringing Android into home automation. Initially keeping all data separate it will go live in october with rolling all the data into Google Now. Should the owner give permission for this. Its yet to be seen if this data will be used to display ads to users.</p><p>However this and the resulting purchase of Dropcam for $555million adds other revenue streams to Google. Making the thermostat and smoke alarms available in Google Play store. Dropcam’s monthly and yearly subscriptions mean a different revenue stream than just adverts. Enabling the push for current users to move to Android from other platforms.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/0c817e76f1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"702\" height=\"336\" /></figure><p>Amongst the acquisitions Google made a huge move for a confusing area in artificial intelligence and automatons. At the end of 2013 it had purchased 8 companies that either made or had direct links with robots. The jewel being huge military backed robot maker Boston Dynamics, alone having a $10.8 million contract with the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).</p><p>Several wild and wonderful market moves have been suggested for Google’s move into robotics. From walking talking adverts to the next level in automated personal assistants. But the move remains a head scratcher. Andy Rubin’s fascination in robots can’t be the only motivator to spend millions upon millions of dollars.</p><p>Despite Google protests it would be impossible to move into this field without government defence contracts. At least in the short term. As none of the Boston Dynamics products are aimed anywhere near retail applications. Although aiming towards manufacturing and processing will allow revenue beyond specific military areas.</p><h2 id=\"xlabs-and-moon-shots\">XLabs And Moon Shots</h2><p>The pinnacle of Google’s outlandish spending is Google legendary XLabs. The top secret area where engineers develop cutting edge technology. Also receiving funding for huge gambles and so called ‘Moon shots’. These advances are to see what engineers really can achieve given the chance. It is impossible to know how many projects fail. But several projects have appeared from the X Labs and do generate an income to Google.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"uploads/2024/878ad295eb.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"702\" height=\"313\" /></figure><p>Such as Google’s self driving cars, the technology is set to be put into cars in the next 12-18 months. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/loon/\">Project Loon to bring internet access to less developed areas</a>. This has received funding from carriers and is set to go into more extensive testing. Also Google Glass, the social dividing face computer that <a href=\"https://www.google.com/glass/start/\">Google claim is the future</a>. This may not pay back the millions put into development, but it clearly is an area Google is willing to fund. If only to gain information to use in Google Now development.</p><h2 id=\"this-isn%E2%80%99t-the-end\">This Isn’t The End</h2><p>Google is clearly moving into other areas of income to prop up a predicted decline in advertising revenue. However it clear this is not happening just yet. Around 95% of Google’s revenue is still linked to advertising. There are many areas that Google could choose to put its ads on. Much like the apps in the app store. The vast majority of service are free, providing you can put up with a few ads.</p><p>With even a few inservice purchases thrown in for good measure. If the adverts are apparently not working, and not intrusive. Users are obviously willing to put up with them in exchange for great services. Would users pay for a version of service without the ads? Or is Google set to become a freemium service?</p>\n",

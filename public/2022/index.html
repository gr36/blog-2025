  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Following my link post <a href="/2022/12/31/i-really-want.html">talking about bullet journals,</a> I received quite a few replies. Many from those that have, like me, tried and failed to use physical tools, but some from advocates. One <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://micro.blog/ChrisJWilson/15588407">worth noting was from sketch noter Chris Wilson</a>, and <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="/replies/2022/12/31/15588729.html">my response</a> was something I wanted to expand on.</p>
<p>I have come to terms with the fact that, despite my love of physical things, digital tools suit me better. I always have one <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="/2022/11/18/apple-watch-ultra.html">on my wrist</a>, in my pocket, or I am sat at my desk. This is not for want of trying. In January, each year, I buy a diary, accompanied by some new notebooks, and throw myself in again. Only to fail sometime in the next month and go back to Apple Reminders. I don’t have a super stressful job that requires me to project manage or anything in depth, but I have numerous tasks that fall onto my desk each day.</p>
<p>What I have noticed from this cycle of trying is that without conscious thought, digital tools can be just as bad as physical ones. The expectation is that these intelligent apps will somehow make sure we get everything done, when in fact there is the same risk of a pile up of tasks that will never be checked off. There is no magic app that will get things done for you, and I’ve tried them all, you <em>have</em> to put the work in too.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/6ffe42324c.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2>Reviewing</h2>
<p>One of the most beneficial practices from bullet journaling is having to copy tasks over to the new day. Keeping things in your mind and making sure they are completed on time. The best way to do this digitally is by scheduling in at least a weekly review of all your tasks. I do this as the first thing in my calendar every Monday. Reviewing each task in my lists, the steps I follow are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>making sure everything that <em>has</em> to be done has a due date</li>
	<li>nothing is in my inbox</li>
	<li>tasks that do not have a due date after 4 weeks are given one or deleted</li>
	<li>all tasks are scheduled around other calendar appointments</li>
	<li>calendar blocks are put in for all tasks that require <a href="/2021/11/10/going-deeper.html">deep work</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This practice is easy to dismiss, but from experiences if you do not take time to address all the things expected of you, then things will be missed. Tasks will end up gathering digital dust without due dates. You will begin to struggle to remember when and if tasks need completing or if you have already done them. Without being mindful of the tasks you have, you <em>will</em> forget things and not get as much done.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/16819e96a2.jpg"/></figure>
<h2>No Exceptions</h2>
<p>Everything needs to go in one place, no exceptions, no excuses and no forgetting! If you have one book to write everything in, then you <em>must</em> have one app to do the same. There is no perfect app and to be honest, most people will suffice with whatever app is pre-installed on your phone. Apple Reminders is my favourite app to use because it works with Siri. I find it hugely beneficial to ask Siri to do it rather than tapping through options, or even having to pull out my phone.</p>
<p>This isn’t a pitch for a specific app, far from it. It’s more of a plea to pick something and stick with it. A <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="/2019/07/29/a-new-productivity.html">new app won’t help you get things done</a>, but a better system will. I have to use <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="/2020/05/18/how-i-use.html">Todoist for work tasks</a> currently, but this will be stopping in the new year thankfully. However, even if you want to use one app for work and one for home to separate things, this is still an easy way to work.</p>
<p>There are many things that physical todo lists excel in and there is no getting around it. If you really want to get things done, you have to put in some effort too. Expecting an app to save you without putting in the work is a shortcut to failing.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Jon Porter writing in The Verge about his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23520891/bullet-journal-lessons-to-do-list-apps">move back to apps</a> rather than a physical journal via <a href="https://canneddragons.net/2022/12/30/bullet-journaling-in-2023">Robert Rackley</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having to write each task out manually turned a to-do from something I could just file away in an app and forget about into something that I had to manage on a daily basis.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have tried manual task lists about as often as I try physical journaling. It falls down when I begin to forget to carry the book around, or I start missing things because I forgot to write it down. However, there is not doubting the physical act of having to sort tasks manually each day helps you get things done.</p>
<p>As Jon covers in the excellent article, just the process of bringing tasks to your attention means that “you get around to doing a non-urgent task after forcing yourself to write it out every day for a week”. This timescale also tracks with me and the point at which I would complete a task I would rather not do just to stop having to write it out. 5–7 days is also the point that I would hold on to a task and perhaps decide it didn’t need doing for the very same reason.</p>
<p>This perhaps make you think poorly of bullet journaling, but the same applies to all the fancy apps on the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s easy to think that an app or to-do list service will take you by the hand and organise your life for you, but if you’re not careful, it can just become an infinite digital locker with a messy collection of notes filed under “forget.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If you don’t put the work in and review your tasks periodically no app will save you from reaching the very same dead end.</p>
<p>The biggest reason I can’t get on with journaling, bar having to carry around a book, is the fact I can’t make it look as nice as I think I should look. My book is utilitarian rather than filled with delightful sketches and perfect handwriting you see from advocates. The embarrassment of my book is enough to keep it hidden away rather than front and centre like it should be. Thus killing any notion of using a physical book or bullet journaling dead on arrival.</p>

      <p>Sarah Frier pointing out that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-12-29/why-are-friends-not-in-my-instagram-feed-2022-marked-a-shift?sref=Qk91czAc">DJ Khaled is not your friend</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This year, social media mostly stopped offering a window into the lives of our loved ones. It turns out that the social part of social media, which helped shape human behavior online and off for more than a decade, is proving to be something of a fad.</p></blockquote>
<p>This tracks with almost every other news story about social media that doesn’t involve Musk. Social media companies are trapped in a loop that limits friends posts reach to prioritise viral content, leading to less posts by friends, thus less posts to show you.</p>
<p>As they all scrabble for your attention the only winners are advertisers, and those aiming for maximum attention. When there is no social in the networks anymore they just become a media channel.</p>

      <p>The indieweb has become an important part of my decision-making when it comes to online things. It wouldn’t stop me from using a new service if support was lacking, but it would form a large chunk of the decision-making. I think it’s essential to make sure where you put your content and spend your time is a good place. Not only that is supports you as a person, but also the web as a whole. I’m just not into placing my content onto services that use it for their gain any longer and the implosion at Twitter has done us all a favour.</p>
<p>As such, I have begun to create myself a place on the web, particularly the <a href="/2022/12/20/overthinking-social-media.html">social web</a>, that is wholesome and ethical. Mastodon continues to be an excellent, if a little nosey currently, place to be, and you can follow my posts by subscribing to <code>@gr36@social.lol</code>. This is more personal things and throw away posts that social media is made for. Shout out to <a href="https://home.omg.lol/">omg.lol</a> while we’re at it as a superb service that started as a landing page for social media but just keeps offering more and more.</p>
<p>When it comes to blogging, I’ve been an avid user of micro.blog for some time. Although I chose to move my website to <a href="/2021/11/05/a-new-home.html">a new home</a> this year, it didn’t last long, so my more relaxed place to publish is at gr36.com. Hosted with its own presence in the indieweb, and you can follow it anywhere that supports ActivityPub <code>@greg@gr36.com</code>. This will contain everything I publish, short or long and also all my photography, similar to an RSS feed but for the social web. You can even reply to posts, and they appear as comments.</p>
<p>When it comes to feeds, there&rsquo;s still a notion floating around that RSS is dead. This is as ridiculous this year as it has been for the last few, and continues to be where plenty of people read blog posts. I like to split my posts a little for those not wanting a feed full of my ramblings. The RSS feed at <a href="https://gr36.com/rss">gr36.com/rss</a> contains just blog posts, whereas the <a href="https://gr36.com/json">JSON feed</a> contains everything.</p>
<p>For some strange reason people tend to like following me and always make my online world as nice as possible. If all of this information means nothing to you then I apologise and presume you’re already following along in the best way for you. Carry on.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There isn’t usually much to report from my Christmas day. We spend the day, like most of those that celebrate, eating too much and being thankful for everything we have. This year has been a tough year for us all, with personal struggles and economic issues to contend with. However, this has led to considerable personal growth.</p>
<p>My son has been working really hard on his confidence and social skills since going to secondary school. Lucie has been developing her own way of communicating with us all, despite not being able to talk. We have a lot to be thankful for, despite the slight uphill nature of this year.</p>
<p>My wife and I had a very long conversation about the stresses of Christmas once we had both sat down after lunch. The expenditure and organisational stress often gets on top of us, but we are always aware of the need to recognise what we have to be happy for. Christmas is always a stressful time, and even if the day goes perfectly to plan, which it rarely does, you always wonder if you’ve done enough. We all feel this external pressure to present Christmas as this perfect little event and put too much on ourselves to make the day perfect.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/481ad61dc1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Life isn’t like the movies and TV shows though. The trickster element of the universe loves to throw a spanner or two in there to keep you on your toes. However, rarely do we realise that there is absolutely no need for Christmas to be like you see elsewhere. Everyone’s Christmas is the same as yours, regardless of <a href="/2021/05/31/insides-vs-outsides.html">what they present it as</a>. They are all chaotic, stressful and a long way from perfect, so there’s no point worrying about it.</p>
<p>No one will lay on their deathbed and wonder why that one a Christmas we had wasn’t flawless. They will be happy that we were all together, or as together as possible, and grateful with it. They all come in different shapes and sizes with their ups and down, so enjoy them while you can. Merry Christmas to all this that celebrate, and wonderful tidings to those that don’t.</p>
<p>Whatever you’re up to at this time of year, I hope you enjoy it. ❤️</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I usually pick something that I want to focus on for the coming year. The past couple have gone by in a blur of COVID and other issues so I haven’t put as much attention towards them as I’d like. Last year, I wanted to watch more films as a way of getting back my attention and returning to a lost love, but I failed miserably. This year I am picking something more important to me than ever before, I feel like I’m getting old, so my theme this year is <strong>slower</strong>.</p>
<p>I have always given myself <a href="/2022/07/27/210805.html">a hard time</a> for resting and relaxing, even though it’s an essential part of life. Feeling as if I am wasting my time by <a href="/2022/07/31/gaming-life-level.html">playing games</a> or simply doing nothing, but it is making me ill. Since <a href="/2022/10/06/morning-for-a.html">my serious health issues</a> of early 2022 I have begun creeping back into my old ways of being constantly on the move and not giving myself time to recover. As I published before “Stillness is the only indicator of when I am really ill” but that will be no more.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5e6a8969e2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I need to give myself space to breathe and be alone with my thoughts more often. Leading to better decisions, retaining more information and much less mental stress. Far from being lazy, I have already discovered that slowing down actually allows me to do be more active when I need to be and achieve more whilst doing it. I have plans next year to finally run my return marathon, so I will need all the rest and recuperation I can get, but this slowness goes much deeper than just giving my body time to recover.</p>
<p>By being slower at everything, the quality of what I am doing will improve, whether that be designing something at work or writing a blog post. It will save me work in the long run in revisions and correcting silly mistakes. Moving fast and breaking things only goes so far. The last thing I want to do is break myself, and in 2023 slowness is the key.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2022/12/22/its-like-twitter.html"><h1 class="p-name">It’s Like Twitter Only Worse</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When users first log into Mastodon after fleeing Twitter, I can almost guarantee that this is one of their first thoughts. The “Social networking that&rsquo;s not for sale” didn’t aim to be the detox drug for those seeking to ween themselves off the bird site, but despite its claims to be radically different, it offers the perfect replacement. Mastodon doesn’t work as well though, and that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>There’s just no getting around the fact that Mastodon looks and feels very much like Twitter. So much so that many people expect to be able to treat it the same and wonder why some features are missing. With the introduction of apps like <a href="https://social.lol/@ivory@tapbots.social">Ivory</a>, the excellent app from Tweetbot maker <a href="https://tapbots.com/">Tapbots</a> that is still in alpha phase, this likeness becomes even more apparent. In fact, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@birchtree/109553943240120054">some users</a> have only begun to use Mastodon because of these similarities. The ways in which it differs though is an important part of the service, and something that a lot of thought goes into.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3f25069f7c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>One of the biggest sticking points is still onboarding and the need to choose a server to join. Granted, most people sign up for one of the largest instances mastodon.social, simply because it comes up top for a Google search of Mastodon. However, joining through the correct channels will mean making a choice, and this is introducing friction in order for the user to put in some thought. Which instance you join is actually important, you will get the most from Mastodon by joining like-minded people, although it is <a href="/2022/12/02/moving-my-mastodon.html">effortless to move</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best example of these intentional barriers is the inability to add a comment to boosting a post, the Mastodon version of a re-tweet. This is <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/14597">intentionally missing</a> to avoid the usual use of dunking on someone, and also encourage interaction. It doesn’t take a lot to be able to achieve a similar result by copying a link to the post and sharing, but adds in just the right amount of friction to put you off. Hopefully allowing enough time for you to think twice about your action, and perhaps decide better of it.</p>
<p>By adding in <a href="/2019/12/17/intentional-barriers.html">intentional barriers</a> to certain parts of the social media experience, Mastodon nurtures what it feels is a better experience overall. Decentralisation is a big part of this, but also with the way the service works. Encouraging interaction and conversation, along with a completely chronological timeline, makes Mastodon a fundamentally better place to be than attention economy driven social media. It might seem ‘worse’ but it’s better for you all round.</p>

      <p>The original title to this post used the word agonising. It was a bit too strong, but perhaps displayed the annoyance and thought that I have put into not repeating the same social media mistakes. In its simplest form, I can’t decide what to do with my social media usage, and that means I’m doing everything just in case.</p>
<p>The issue all stems from Twitter. I can’t allow myself to get to a stage where I feel like I have to use a noisy service that’s bad for my brain. Mastodon used to be that place, but as the user base has ramped up more and more, I’m starting to feel like it will become just another Twitter. I’ve written <a href="/2022/12/01/snacking-on-the.html">about this before</a>, only the day before deciding to <a href="/2022/12/02/moving-my-mastodon.html">go all in on micro.blog</a> to help stem the noise.</p>
<p>This helped to start with. No boosts, no local and federated feed to lose myself in—bliss. However, all I did was follow everyone on Mastodon in a worse app. Without the filtering and muting available on Mastodon directly, I couldn’t bare to open the app. It ruined the one refuge away from the noise, so the solution was to <a href="/2022/12/19/decided-im-going.html">go back</a>. Unfortunately, two weeks on and several Elon decisions later means the user base has swelled even more and there’s <a href="https://social.lol/@gr36/109541557715084542">now brands there</a>!</p>
<p>I need a space that lets me interact with people but doesn’t burst my brain with a constant stream of ‘stuff’. Perhaps this place will never exit, or that I need to put some work into curating my feed. This was pointed out to me by Twitter users when I complained about similar issues there. I remained in the mindset that if I have to put loads of work in to make it right, it’s not the best place to start with.</p>
<p>I have hope that Mastodon calms down a bit, or that I can perhaps find an app that lets me filter things more granular. Turning off boosts perhaps or putting people into lists. Whatever the solution is, there is one thing for sure—I will keep fretting over it for no good reason.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Nathan Schneider for <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/mastodon-isnt-just-a-replacement-for-twitter">Norma mag</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scalability explains a lot of what seems wrong with social media. Content moderation at scale needs to be semi-automated, which often means applying universal rules without context or nuance. And when abuse, harassment and misinformation drive engagement, the incentive is to address it in a way that doesn’t threaten business.</p></blockquote>
<p>There have been many words written about how large scale social media doesn’t really have an incentive to get rid of hate. The reality is that if engagement is the measurement of income, then moderation decisions all of a sudden become much more complicated so as not to harm the bottom line. Nowhere more apt is the adage “if you’re not paying for the product…” become more appropriate than a social media platform that has harassment problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fediverse opens new doors. It allows us the possibility to collectively own and more fully self-govern the online communities we participate in.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is attractive, and also a little worrisome to those on gigantic instances, is the idea that in the fediverse you can self govern. You as a user have a choice to own the things you see online and the people you interact with. If you don’t like the way something goes, you can move your experience quickly and easily.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just like on the rest of the internet, anyone, from violent extremists to people with uncommon hobbies, can use the available tools to create siloed spaces. The difference with the fediverse is that it facilitates a structure of relationships between communities.</p></blockquote>
<p>I truly believe that as long as what you post online isn’t illegal, you should be allowed to do so. What Mastodon and the larger fediverse allowed users to do is to find a place where they can self express themselves, but also shield themselves from expression that they don’t want to see.</p>
<p>The idea that the fediverse is like your neighbourhood and your instance is your house works well here. If your neighbours do not behave in a way that you think is appropriate, you as an individual can choose to no longer allow interaction. Your neighbourhood also has the power to remove said house, or indeed the house can move to a neighbourhood that better fits its identity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently, many servers appear to be run top-down by people who have the technical skills to set them up, but not necessarily with the social and economic capacity to foster and sustain community self-governance and address online harm.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope that enough people and communities build up the knowledge and funding to move into smaller instances where they can self govern. Currently, too many users fleeing Twitter are on large-scale servers controlled by individuals or small groups.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the venture capital model were unleashed on the fediverse, the democratic potential of software like Mastodon would likely be lost.</p></blockquote>
<p>My biggest worry, and what I fear is inevitable, is that someone like Google creates or purchases a multimillion user instance and starts wielding too much power. This would destroy everything that is good about the fediverse.</p>

      <p>This crafty little ego keeps trying to work its way into my life. Today I am taking my son to Arsenal to watch a game, it’s his first time, so naturally he’ll want to take in the sites and take some photos. Unfortunately, my primary response is downloading Instagram ready to record some stories.</p>
<p>Photos and videos as memories are one thing, but my ego wants to show off on Instagram. I’m ready to thumb my nose at my followers. Look where we are, look what we’re doing, we’re having more fun than you!</p>
<p>Not all Stories shared are for this reason, but that <em>is</em> the reason I wanted to share mine. I might still do so, but in the right way because showing off is not like me at all.

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There are loads of services and apps in my life that I pay for. Perhaps too many, but if I value a service and use it a lot, I like to pay the developers something for their trouble. It feels unethical to use something and not contribute if you can, so I spend too much money on services. However, there’s something that flips in my brain once I start paying for something and I become much less tolerable to bugs.</p>
<p>Hey, bugs happen, and they happen lots in complex software. Although I am uncertain if there is some weird logic going on in my brain, but I just expect then when a service is free or very cheap. Unfortunately, the tide turns, and I tend to start asking questions and getting frustrated when signing up for a subscription and the bugs are still there.</p>
<p>I, rightly or wrongly, expect a service to keep on improving and getting better if it is supported by a subscription and tend to quit things quickly if they don’t start improving. I am not crazy for thinking this, right?</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’ve had enough of reading and listening about Twitter as the next person. So much so I’ve muted the words on Mastodon, and it has removed almost all trace of it. However, I get it. I still can&rsquo;t help myself reading every new post that crosses my attention, and I know why we all feel the need to talk about what is going on over at the bird site — because it hurts us all.</p>
<p>In no small part, I owe a lot of my career to Twitter. When I first signed up I didn’t understand it at all, but quickly found loads of new people to follow and out of it grew my love of technology. First by getting in deep to the jailbreaking scene, hacking the Palm Pre, and then later on I was in to Android in a big way. I was motivated to learn, write and interact with people I met all over the world. For some strange reason, my followers swelled to thousands and some of them even took me seriously and one point!</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/175966a1af.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Due to my writing and covering technology, I became the resident tech support at home and in my day job. Eventually leaving my sales job to do what I loved full time. All the skills I have now are because I wanted to do something that I had learnt about on Twitter. Unlock a Galaxy phone using the commend line or testing out some new app and giving design feedback. I went to school for none of the things that make me good at my job now, my school was Twitter and the people I met there.</p>
<p>That is why the downfall of Twitter hurts so much. I spent years of my life there, having fun, meeting new people and learning things that I would not have found anywhere else. I sense that this is the same for many people I know that have had to leave. Not through force or harassment, but they have left because they cannot support the site any more. We held on as long as we could because of those glory day we all enjoyed, but those days are gone. Twitter is gone, it hurts, but let’s move on together.</p>

      <p>Matt Tait in <a href="https://www.pwnallthethings.com/p/twitter-was-special-but-its-time">Pwnallthethings</a> hitting the nail on the head more than once, but the real sticking take away was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people will love Trump’s tweets. Others will hate them. But Elon doesn’t really care so long as you pay to talk about it and watch ads as you do.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve heard take after take after take on Twitter and what’s happening, but this sums it up perfectly. The game to boost engagement is to have the best and worst things on the platform, and Twitter has been too cleaned up for Elons liking.</p>
<p>He does care who you like or don’t like. I have no doubt that half the things he says he doesn’t mean, but he is stuck with a $44bn bill to pay that increases at more than $1bn a year.</p>
<p>There is only one way to pay for this. The more people that use Twitter for talking about Twitter, the more ads are shown. Elon doesn’t care if you like or hate the tweets, as long as you are talking about them on Twitter. The best thing you can do right now is just leave and never go back. Nothing that you get from the service has got to be worth this, surely?</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Since moving all of my proverbial <a href="/2022/12/05/one-contact-point.html">social media eggs into one basket,</a> it has become obvious that a noisy feed sucks. Don’t get me wrong, there are some gigantic benefits from following everyone from one app, and not doing my usual bounce around several apps to elevate boredom. Unfortunately, I doubt that the best pace for this is micro.blog because it’s making my experience worse.</p>
<p>Like many users on the service, <a href="/2018/01/20/using-microblog-aka.html">I use micro.blog</a> because it <a href="/2021/04/11/time-to-slow.html">is slow</a>, thoughtful and much quieter than most places on the internet. Currently, Mastodon is the opposite of that ethos, it’s fast-paced, constantly updating and in many ways just like Twitter. Which is fine, I love Mastodon, but the very nature of the service is ruining my one soils away from the noise, and unfortunately, it lacks robust filtering and muting options.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c8e763011e.jpg" alt="Dall -E: illustration of a stressed person with a mobile phone" title="Dall -E: illustration of a stressed person with a mobile phone"></p>
<p>This is no slight against the service, there has been absolutely no reason for me to need it until now, I’ve never felt the need to mute or even unfollow anyone before. The only options available for me currently is a timeline with all posts, or one without replies. The saving grace is third-party app Gluon, but this doesn’t carry over into using micro.blog on the web, which I do the majority of the time. To get the best from the environment I am trying to create, I require some filtering or dare I say it, a sorting algorithm.</p>
<p>I get it, that’s never going to happen. The presumption is that implementing machine learning for sorting your feed and prioritising some posts is always bad. When the truth is that for a truly scalable social platform it should be a priority. It doesn’t have to maximise user engagement or any other trap of the attention economy, it just has to quieten down your feed. It really is <a href="/2021/04/22/the-problem-of.html">a problem of scale</a>. I could quite happily follow hundreds of people on Twitter, but couldn’t even think about that kind of number of any other service.</p>
<p>I am thrilled that so many people have left Twitter behind, but the increased engagement with Mastodon means I need to find a way to escape every now and again. For now, I believe I will have to split these two services apart again to make sure I can hide away from the noise some of the time.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Yesterday<a href="/2022/12/13/my-favourite-reading.html"> I posted</a> that I had jumped in with the new pricing strategy for Matter and become a <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/patron">Patron subscriber</a>. Strangely, I thought that most people had heard of this amazing ‘Read it later’ app as it was the new hotness for a while. Following some questions on why I choose to use it and comparisons to other services, I thought I’d cover a the main thing I like about it.</p>
<p>The app has been a staple on my iPhone and iPad for what seems like forever, and giving back £130 for my free usage and receiving another 3 years of service thrown in is the least I could contribute. First things first, I honestly have no idea why I use it over another service. Not because it isn’t great, but because I haven’t used a whole load of different options and I just enjoy using <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/">Matter,</a> so never look around. They’re a risk, like with note app, that you can spend too much time moving about and not enough time reading.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/cd83a5fb77.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>When it started, Matter had built into it a social side where you could follow friends and see what they were reading and see highlights and comments from them. I really enjoyed this part, and after spending a little over a year helping to <a href="https://www.getupnext.com/">develop Upnext</a> I jumped ship to Matter. Using the free app to save all the content I found around the web to consume later. Matter calls itself “a better reader” and on the surface it is exactly that. You can save links from all over the web, not just articles, and access them later to read in a much better environment.</p>
<p>The app offers highlighting, commenting, leaving notes on sections you’re interested in, and all the usually expected functions of a reading app. The exceptional side to Matter is that it then combines with everything else to make your consumption of things better. Including an excellent integration with Gmail that pulls newsletters into your subscriptions tab with no interaction needed. This is especially useful for longer editions that I receive from <a href="https://www.platformer.news/">Platformer</a> or <a href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/">Galaxy Brain</a>.</p>
<p>I can then highlight and takes notes on the parts that I want to remember later, and send them to wherever it is that I intend to save them. Matter already integrates with note-taking apps like Roam Research, Logseq and Obsidian, but I can also send them straight into <a href="/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html">my Apple Notes system</a> or write about them in Ulysses. More often than not, though, I can archive them into my permanent folder and refer to them later on if needed.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/98992a96bc.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>All of this has been free for months, and even when they introduce the Subscription in January you will only pay if you want things like fluid highlighting, note-taking and integrations. It will remain a totally free read it later service with <strong>no ads</strong>. I think this is why I could never see myself using anything else. I love the app, it works well and does even more than I require it too, but I also trust the company. They are not using my consumption data to show me ads or sell it on for a quick profit.</p>
<p>The company now has a robust business model (it was a bit of a concern before, but I expected a subscription eventually) and see themselves as being around for years to come. There are other services around, I was a long-time user of Pocket, but Matter have built up for me as such it is and will continue to be my most used app. It continues to get better and better and now with even more funding behind it there are exciting time to come.</p>

      <p>For a long time, I have never thought about the topics that I write about. Granted, I still think I am some kind of tech reporter, but I have no desired to actually write about the topics needed to become one (plus I suck). I much prefer to publish things that come to mind and let others decide whether they want to read dit or not. Only when Jarrod kindly <a href="https://jarrod.micro.blog/2022/12/12/for-micro-monday.html">encouraged people to read my blog</a> because I wrote about writing did I think about how meta my blog is.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about why I write, so I guess this seems like a logical step from thought to publish. Many of the people I follow seem to struggle with either wanting to write more and not having a subject, or pigeonhole themselves to a point they feel trapped. The truth is, I often start typing away intending to publish something without even a topic in mind. The tactile feedback from my keyboard is enough to keep my happy for a little while.</p>
<p>I don’t have ‘a thing’. There isn’t one area that motivates me to write about it, there is just me. I think that is the reason that my posts meander around some topics, but rarely stay still. There’s some tech, some personal things, some really random posts, but mostly it is just what is going on in my head. That is why a service like micro.blog suits me so well, because there’s only one blog with everything posted to it. I don’t have to worry about <a href="/2021/02/13/where-does-this.html">where this post goes</a> or if it fits in with a certain site.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with the meta posts on my blog, but I think I need to expand a bit more. Last year I brought in a <a href="/2021/11/07/a-writing-kanban.html">writing Kanban board</a> that allowed me to be the <a href="/2021/11/30/writing-everyday-is.html">most active</a> I have ever been, but I feel that these posts will still revolve around the same topics without some effort on my part. We’ll see.</p>

      <p>I’m pretty certain, if it doesn’t exist already, that in the near future you will be able to predict my mental state from my blog posts. They show where my thoughts are currently and often what is going on in my life. I enjoy posting, but there is something exposing about hitting publish and your words being there for all to see, but it is one of the best things you can do.</p>
<p>Everyone does what I do. Except they vent into private chat groups, social media DMs and sometimes on social media itself. They express themselves through words, or increasingly voice notes, to let others know what they are feeling — they just don’t do it as publicly as others. Though they really should.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2a84d41524.jpg" alt="Dall-E digital art of someone writing in the street "></p>
<p>This isn’t another one of those posts where I try to <a href="/2022/12/02/you-deserve-a.html">convince everyone to get a blog</a>, nor is it one where I <a href="/2022/11/17/ten-days-no.html">have a go at Social Media</a>. It is more of a realisation of the way that writing in public makes you feel. Embarrassed, sometimes down, but more often than not I feel relief and closure from the words I publish. I sometimes struggle to allow myself to feel the things I do so publicly, but the intrinsic rewards of every post are overwhelmingly positive.</p>
<p>That is not to imply that i don’t sometimes have to keep <a href="/2021/02/11/needing-feedback.html">a lid on my ego</a>, and think about the reasons I am writing my post — but over the years this has become rare. The reasons I post are because I think that someone out there might read my things and like it, but even if they don’t, I enjoyed doing so in public. Allowing myself to feel exposed and ensure the things that I may otherwise have shared privately are indeed correct. There is nothing like shining a light on your thoughts and ideas to let you know where the cracks in them are.</p>
<p>I might regret it in the future when the robot overlords take over, but it&rsquo;s all I’ve known for more than a decade and I love it.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Since Twitter imploded, I am ecstatic that a lot of the wonderful people I have met online have followed me out. It gives me even less reason to <a href="/2022/12/01/104000.html">think about</a> going back, but I’ve seen some bubbling thoughts about returning. What social network you choose to use shouldn’t be this hard, but I do know why there are these lingering doubts, and it’s mainly to do with FOMO.</p>
<p>The Fear Of Missing Out is a powerful motivator. Hell, it’s the reason, historically, I <a href="/2019/12/16/losing-minimal.html">bought so much tech</a>. I see things online, and they look cool, so I feel like I’m missing out on something. This is precisely what others are starting to feel, they are under the impression they are missing out on things happening, and that feeling sucks. However, it’s important to think if you actually <em>are</em> missing out or the feelings are unfounded.</p>
<p>I understand. Your followers have more than halved, and there are people who did not follow you to where it is you’re hanging out now. Are you actually missing out though? Think of some specific things you are missing out on, or is it just the thought of not being there when something happens? That’s what kept me on Twitter so long, and I’m sure loads of other people.</p>
<p>Look, you can use whatever platform you want, and you certainly shouldn’t feel like you can’t use something because other people have left. You should love what you love, hate what you hate <a href="/2021/06/12/hate-what-you.html">and enjoy it</a>. The feelings you feel are just that, feelings. Unless you need to be there to cover every new thing, there’s a lot of enjoyment in missing out (EOMO) on things. Most of which will pass you buy, and you won’t care, and the important things will get to you no matter what.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There are a few unsolvable questions in my life. What iPhone will I actually use? Which read it later service is the best one? Will I ever stop changing notes apps and actually write some notes? Perhaps the biggest ones revolve around social media. I haven’t been <a href="/2018/05/25/intentional-twitter-usage.html">happy with my usage of it</a> for years, but still as yet can’t find a solution.</p>
<p>This is frankly a ridiculous issue to have, but my feeling on Social Media boil down to my relationship with Twitter. I love it, well perhaps loved is the better word. The microblogging service has meant I have met some really awesome people that have become close friends, but has also ruined my attention span and <a href="/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html">given me a boredom avoidance crutch</a> for too long. I am in many ways thankful the billionaire baby ruined the experience, so I could fully leave. Since then, I have spent <a href="/2022/12/01/104000.html">too much time worrying about</a> where to spend my time.</p>
<p>I still found myself bouncing around from app to app when boredom struck, and having too many places to check, transferred my addiction rather than solved it. So, with a great deal of trepidation, I decided to go all in on micro.blog and <a href="/2022/12/02/moving-my-mastodon.html">forward my Mastodon account to it</a>. One app with <a href="/2022/12/04/i-am-really.html">all of my social media usage</a> in it was a risk, there are some massive advantages but also so downsides that I have to think about.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/22b9a2fdca.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="much-calmer">Much Calmer</h2>
<p>Although micro.blog uses ActivityPub and allows you to follow any other accounts that use the indieweb protocol, it isn’t Mastodon. As such, there <em>are</em> things that I miss out on. The most obvious being that it doesn’t show boosts. This is a bit of a controversial point on Mastodon, but this removal has actually improved my enjoyment.</p>
<p>I was one of the people that was calling for Mastodon to introduce boosts with comment, but now I really do understand why it isn’t there, and I really enjoy not having boosts at all. Admittedly, it <em>does</em> cut down on discoverability a bit, but I maintain that good people to follow will always come around. I love the interaction and conversations on Mastodon, and these still show up and allow me to still find new people.</p>
<p>Using micro.blog I also cannot see any local or federated timelines, so some openness of Mastodon is cut off. The flip side is that I am not lost scrolling through lists and feeds looking for something to entertain, and overall has made me ‘check in’ much less. Only worrying about the last few things that are happening and my mentions.</p>
<h2 id="less-control">Less Control</h2>
<p>Being the worrier that I am, giving up control of my one sole access to social media is a bit of a gamble. What if micro.blog were to suffer an issue, or stop working completely? Perhaps they change the way it works by some way I don’t like, or increase the pice by an untenable amount. Much like Twitter, micro.blog is controlled by one person who makes all the decisions, but I trust <a href="https://www.manton.org">Manton</a> a lot more than I trust Musk.</p>
<p>Being a smaller used service, there is not the choice of apps that there are for Mastodon. Although everything is open source, the demand does not facilitate numerous apps being created. The official app is fine, but this is something to be aware of when you’re all in on a service. It could be worse, I could be forced to use the WordPress app!</p>
<h2 id="diversity-of-followers">Diversity Of Followers</h2>
<p>Having used micro.blog on and off for years, I am aware that the people who make up its user base tend not to be very diverse (with exceptions of course). The barrier to entry of the service tends to mean that the topics discussed are very cyclical and insular in nature. Whereas Mastodon is the opposite. Although a little nerdy to understand, I have found a far more diverse set of people to follow than I ever did on Twitter.</p>
<p>Making sure that this exists is an important way for me to gain a wide range of opinions on topics. By adding in Mastodon, I feel this is much easier to achieve, although I do feel as if this may be harder going forward given my inability to browse timelines and not see all posts. However, by being mindful of this, I should avoid building myself an echo chamber.</p>
<h2 id="removal-of-the-social-media-trappings">Removal Of The Social Media Trappings</h2>
<p>Using micro.blog also removed all the follower counts and social media shenanigans that taint any service. Granted, Mastodon does not use ranking algorithms and the like, but does have hashtags that are gamed and some users that yearn for attention. This is all stripped away on micro.blog and Manton has been <a href="https://www.manton.org/2018/11/07/microblog-mastodon.html">clear</a> that he will continue down this line. In his words, “compatibility with Mastodon lets us support the good things that Mastodon has accomplished, while still carrying forward what, I think, are the unique strengths of Micro.blog.”</p>
<h2 id="lack-of-mute">Lack Of Mute</h2>
<p>One part of Mastodon I absolutely loved was the powerful muting. I quickly set up a range of filters that meant politics nor Twitter craziness graced my feed. None of this exists on micro.blog bar muting users. I have hope that perhaps this will improve in the future, however as yet I have not seen any of this. I have a feeling that boosts may cut a lot of this out, however I will need to keep a real eye on things.</p>
<p>With all things said it does worry me having one point of contact with all of the social web, but so far I have found it very calming. I have removed the issues surrounding consuming the internet in bit side chunks and calmed down my feed. How long this confidence lasts will be interesting but at the moment is has been a good decision. I own all of the content I put out now and it is all on one place, syndicated to wherever I want it to.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2022/12/05/shortcuts-to-use.html"><h1 class="p-name">Shortcuts To Use With Micro.blog</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Several people still point to <a href="/2021/04/01/how-i-set.html">my older post</a> on how I post to my blog using automation. Unfortunately, some of these Shortcuts no longer work or can be done better, so I decided to update them. Here’s all the Shortcuts I use to publish and use micro.blog to help you automate your life.</p>
<h2 id="microblog-post-search">Micro.blog Post Search</h2>
<p>I love linking my posts together and making sure I reference and expand on previous thoughts. The easiest way to do this is to search on micro.blog for the old posts, and you can do this with one tap.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e6c3cfa50e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Grab the Shortcut <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/81a80d6045d641978c9a4a625b382913">here</a>, and change the text to your account ID number found by doing a post search and getting the numbers after <code>/posts/</code>and before <code>?q</code>.</p>
<h2 id="image-upload">Image Upload</h2>
<p>For those that include images in your posts and want to upload them beforehand, they usually lean on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">Mimi uploader</a>. An excellent third-party app that helps you do this with one image or full albums of them. However, this Shortcut will do all that for you if you do not need the graphical front end.</p>
<p>Grab it <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ec0296b20f9041daa60abceb634bccd7">here </a>and place your app token in the top text box. Once run, this will ask you to select the images you want to upload and then ask of the alt text of them. Once done, you will have the Markdown syntax for all of your images copied to your clipboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/26a3643377.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="post-to-microblog">Post To Microblog</h2>
<p>This <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fa9fa172631740c1a124eb34e2d01d0b">basic Shortcut</a> forms the backbone of other ones I have built for my posting style. However, it comes in very useful if you want to post from apps that don’t support publishing to micro.blog. So, you can turn your simple text editor of choice into a publishing app by sharing the text to this Shortcut.</p>
<h2 id="life-update">Life Update</h2>
<p>For the last few weeks, I’ve been using this updated version instead of my <a href="/2022/10/17/how-i-use.html">status.lol Shortcut</a> with all the updates of my life. Mine is a pretty boring one, but the Shortcut has allowed me to post things effortlessly.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f3c8fc2be0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Grab it <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d5d12d9b2ced48afaedd4d81894e1841">here</a></p>
<p>I made this modular this time so that other Shortcuts I made can be used. This makes both making the Shortcut and understand what is going on easier. You will need the image upload shortcut, the post to micro.blog shortcut and the omg.lol status Shortcut shown above.</p>
<p>Once saved to my Homescreen I can post a feeting status or a more permanent post to micro.blog. I use this multiple times a day to share <a href="/categories/micro/">micro posts</a> and some of <a href="/photos/">my photography</a>.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2022/12/02/moving-my-mastodon.html"><h1 class="p-name">Moving My Mastodon Account To Micro.blog</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Well, first things first. I am not really moving my Mastodon account to micro.blog in the technical sense but rather forwarding everything, but if you’re reading this you want to do the same. Thankfully, the process is pretty easy, and you won’t need much knowledge to do it.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to do this, is that I can follow Mastodon accounts (or any other ActivityPub service) from inside micro.blog and didn’t see the point using two apps to do the same things. I went <a href="/2022/11/30/shortcut-find-mastodon.html">backwards and forwards</a> on which way I was going to do this, and <a href="/2022/12/01/snacking-on-the.html">decided that a quieter timeline</a> on micro.blog was the way I wanted to go. My only concern was leaving my other Mastodon account on <a href="https://social.lol/">social.lol</a> empty and losing the people that I follow.</p>
<p>I first created an <a href="/2022/11/30/shortcut-find-mastodon.html">iOS Shortcut</a> to find the accounts that I wanted to follow on micro.blog. For more information about following ActivityPub accounts on micro.blog check out the help docs <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/activitypub/95">here</a>. I gave this a day or so to see if this was the way I wanted to go, and then went all in.</p>
<h2 id="microblog-alias">Micro.blog Alias</h2>
<p>On micro.blog head to Account &gt; ActivityPub and click set Mastodon compatible username. The default for this is your micro.blog username, so mine would be <code>@gr36@micro.blog</code> I changed this to one using my custom url and to keep things nice and simple I chose <code>@greg@gr36.com</code>. Once you have done this, your username will appear in a box at the top of the page, next to this click Aliases.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9cb404633a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here, you add in your ‘old’ Mastodon account that you want to transfer followers from and forward all traffic. You can add multiple aliases here if you need to.</p>
<h2 id="mastodon-move">Mastodon Move</h2>
<p>On your Mastodon instance, head to Settings &gt; Account and towards the bottom you will see Move to a different account. Here you need to add in your new micro.blog Mastodon compatible username, and then put in your password.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/024480d6ca.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I would like to point out that you can only migrate once every 30 days, and that the process may take a while to complete. All of your followers will be moved across to the micro.blog account and if anyone replies to your ‘old’ account this will also show up in micro.blog.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/eb021f290d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Although you <em>can</em> unlink these if you want to open your account back up again, I have not tested this. I have no idea if your followers or content come back again, so consider this destructive, unless you find out otherwise and please let me know.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When I see what some people pay for a blog, I gasp. I mean, I get it, I want to publish things as much as the next person, and I admire the dedication, but the costs some people stand to write on the internet makes my eyes water. I wonder if these types of costs are what stop more people having a blog?</p>
<p>It’s no secret I think everyone <a href="/2021/03/22/the-value-of.html">should have a blog</a>, they should write about whatever it that they want to write about if only to get it out of themselves. I am not alone in the feeling, and the great news is that, as Andrew Canion <a href="https://canion.blog/2022/12/01/humansized-services.html">points out</a>, “the internet is healing”. There is a whole range of awesome services popping up and really great prices that should entice more people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is wonderful to see quality products being run by quality people, without any the social media chicanery. This is the way. Long may it last. - <a href="https://canion.blog/2022/12/01/humansized-services.html">Andrew Canion</a></p></blockquote>
<p>He is current testing out the new <a href="https://weblog.lol">Weblog feature</a> of OMG.lol, one of the ridiculously cheap services that are seeing a resurgence. For just $5 a year you can have a great social media landing page, a ready-made community on Mastodon and <a href="https://home.omg.lol">loads more</a>. This isn’t an advert, but it is just one of the services worth noting as you consider your place on the internet, post Twitter.</p>
<p>My personal favourite is micro.blog which takes a bit of work to set up and get going, but you’ve also got <a href="https://blot.im">Blot</a>, <a href="https://write.as/">Write.as</a> and even <a href="https://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> seeing a resurgence. There is absolutely no need to revert to the <a href="https://wordpress.com">expensive services</a> that control a vast amount of the web, and even less of an excuse to start publishing online. You do not have to put yourself under any kind of pressure on a subject to write about, just let yourself publish whatever it is you want to say.</p>
<p>You really do deserve a blog, and to get writing online. More so now than ever before — what are you waiting for?</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Due to the billionaire baby, I’ve been thinking far too much about social media. I can see no end to the news coverage of Twitter or the various escapades on Elmo, and other platforms are just revolving conversations of the same. Mastodon feels like you’re spending time with a begrudged ex that won’t talk about anything else. As such, those topics bleed through into my thoughts, into my writing and seemingly into every part of my life.</p>
<p>Woe betide anyone who brings up Twitter in real life, you will get schooled on my latest thoughts and wish you ever asked! When I published the latest in my long line of posts about social media this morning, I considered I might have a problem on my hands. In my effort to get away from the subject, I am actually making matters worse and perhaps thinking about it too much when in reality it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c115c3a7b1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>To any normal person, it is a pretty easy decision on social media platforms. Use it or not. The conversation or thoughts on the subject go no further. Yet in my internet riddle brain I must way up where people are, who is using the service and then worry about whether it is good for me or not. I wholly blame Twitter for this. Never in the history of humankind have so many users hated being in a place, but not been able to help being drawn back to it. What I must consider is that those unique ambivalent feelings probably won’t exist again.</p>
<p>My thoughts about social media go deeper than they should. In many respects, that is a good thing. Spending some time considering where you place your time is a practice missing from most people’s lives. It can go too far, though. I spend too much time thinking and writing about Twitter that I might as well use it. I am not looking for some self gratification that my decision to leave was right, as most of Mastodon seem to be. Yet, social media is too often occupying my brain when I have better things to write about.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There are <a href="/2022/11/27/ive-replaced-the.html">many things</a> I am taking away from my 30 days no Twitter experiment. The feelings of worry that have all but disappeared are a by product of not being plugged into the attention economy, but I’m still not convinced I am getting the best possible results. My attachment to Mastodon has meant that I am still consuming the internet in bite sized chunks and far too often.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that my new favourite place to hang out is a really nice place to be. Due to the platform not being invested in maximising my time on site, users do not have the worst of the platform shoved in their face. The content is not really an issue, but the snack sized updates feel like I have not moved on. I have theorised that perhaps the constant scroll has associated itself in my brain with a worry state. The sheer fact that I am consuming the internet in the same shallow moving state is also causing me issues.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5e0b259edf.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>At the end of the day, any social network site is a distraction. Granted, sometimes I need those, but more often than not I don’t. Mastodon is great, but ultimately suffers from the same issues as Twitter due to the humans using it. Consuming the internet in a giant feed of updates will eventually fall into the same traps, and I’m not convinced it&rsquo;s good for my brain. It doesn’t matter where those updates are, or <a href="/2022/11/30/shortcut-find-mastodon.html">where I follow along</a> with them, it will still be a tool for my monkey brain to get its fix.</p>
<p>As nice as the place is, I don’t feel like Mastodon is anything more than a replacement. <a href="/2022/11/22/learn-your-lesson.html">Now is the perfect time</a> to consider if the internet should be followed a bit deeper instead through blogs and news sites. Writing more. Sharing and interacting with a bit more care and attention than fleeting updates.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter the words used. A status update is a Toot, is a Tweet, and perhaps I’ve just had enough of all of them? Currently I feel like I’ve escaped an abusive relationship, but I’m hanging around with their slightly nicer identical twin. Sure it’s better, but it’s a bit too familiar.</p>

      <p>I still can’t decide where I want to <a href="https://social.lol/@gr36/109391559674985682">put my time</a>. Do I follow mastodon users on Micro.blog or follow micro.blog users on Mastodon? At the minute I’m doing both, and thankfully it’s straightforward to find <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/activitypub/95">any ActivityPub users</a> on Micro.blog. Even easier with the handy Shortcut!</p>
<div class="full">
<img src="uploads/2024/632f98a9ac.jpg">
</div>
Grab it [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7b13dc07c9004fde9c2988fc4f1ebcc2)
<p>All you have to do is find the user&rsquo;s account and run the Shortcut. You need to highlight the user&rsquo;s account address in Safari and share the webpage to the Shortcut. This is especially handy for people with a complicated instance address. If this isn’t possible, just type (or paste) in the handle when asked.</p>
<p>The Shortcut will then convert the address to the correct format and search micro.blog. From there you can follow the account easily, just make sure you’re signed in. All of your accounts in one place, like magic. That’s interoperability for you!</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The cost of living crisis in the UK has been getting progressively worse for the last few months and is destined to continue that way. Price increases to gas and electric, coupled with corporate greed, has seen food costs rocket upwards with dramatic effect.</p>
<p>I am thankful to not be in a financial position where this will kill me, but the constant worry about money is really starting to take its toll. Food expenses we have cut down on tremendously and started to really budget and plan everything, but heating and electric is becoming a nightmare.</p>
<p>I mean, listen to me with my first world problems, but I’m starting to think that the UK perhaps isn’t as first world as we think. Always having to think about turning things off, and playing the balancing act with heating is really stressful. Constantly considering keeping people at a temperature that they will be OK, but not too warm, where we are wasting money. We shouldn’t be living like this in a developed country.</p>
<p>The threat of falling into debt or not being able to keep my family warm is stressing me out, and the worry of prices going up again after April makes it even worse. Perhaps we’ll just sell up and move somewhere warm.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Despite all the words, the thoughts and the conscious decision to try not to. My monthly challenge of no Twitter for 30 days has not gone as well as it should have. I was hoping to really bring myself around to the idea that I don’t need to be online as much as I am, but instead I’ve just replaced my Twitter scrolling with Mastodon scrolling.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this is much better for me. There’s no need for me to worry about being led down rabbit holes, or toxic tweets being shoved in my face. Mastodon has no motivation to maximise the time I spend engaged, but it’s still worse than nothing.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2b6a7b707c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The good news is that I feel much better for not being on Twitter. Despite all the tech news coverage and seemingly everyone talking about it, I have zero motivation to go back to Twitter. The reason for this is pretty easy for me to recognise because a large percentage of people I follow have <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/elon-musk-and-the-worst-people/">checked out of Twitter too</a>. Helping to curb my feelings of missing out or not being included in conversations.</p>
<p>When I say I have not been on the website, I truly haven’t and that’s the first time in a long while. When I’ve had similar time away, I’ve always checked in a little. Scrolled thought friends profiles without being logged in or had a <a href="/2021/07/09/a-quick-check.html">look to see what’s happening</a>. What I have done though is replaced my <a href="/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html">Twitter muscle memory</a> with Mastodon. Reaching for boredom relief is still built into my subconscious instead of just embracing the boredom.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a step in the right direction though. Despite not really <a href="/2022/11/25/this-may-just.html">seeing the point in sharing</a> so much any more, Mastodon has given me the fix I needed to pull myself away from doom scrolling Twitter. I need to give a massive thank you to the billionaire baby for finally ruining Twitter to a point I don’t care any more. Cheers!</p>

      <p>Given the resent issues with the bird site, it’s been great to see so many people delete their accounts to move away. Voting with your attention is the best way to use the power at your disposal. Of course, you can use whatever site it is that you want to use, but many of the users I am seeing are just moving from one bad silo to another. Perhaps naively, I thought people would have learnt by now to demand more from their social network.</p>
<p>You don’t need to know the ins and out of indie websites and decentralisation to know that any private company that controls your attention is going to do the same things. They all have layers of staff to pay, infrastructure to keep running and as such need to show you as many ads as they possibly can, or charge you money to use it.</p>
<p>So, with disappointment, I see users making the same mistakes that photographers did when Instagram went down hill. Jumping from one silo into another one, that will <em>always</em> end up going the same way. Manipulating the users to maximise time on site is inevitable. Thankfully, this is the perfect opportunity to really think about your social media usage and come to terms with the fact that nothing good can ever come from the attention economy.</p>
<p>With that said, use whatever you want to use and if something brings you happiness, then go for it! However, investing your time into a place, wherever that may be, that has your best interests at heart should be a focus. Not jumping to the new hotness. For many people, there will not be a new place, and perhaps that is the best thing for society. Although I am enjoying using some alternatives such as Mastodon, I am thinking long and hard about my usage and don’t want to swop one bad habit for another one.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When I first stated writing online, I didn’t even know what a blog was. I set up some online hosting, and cobbled together an HTML website from a theme, and then when I posted something I would duplicate a page and link it up on the man index, all manually. No research done, no WordPress, I had no clue. All I knew was that I wanted to publish online and be a writer, and it wasn’t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610095709/http://gr36.com/">until 2013</a> that I really sorted myself out and began to publish properly.</p>
<p>Due to this desire, I wrote about my thoughts about technology on my blog and then posted the links to Facebook and Twitter. I am so glad that I went this way and have almost all of my posts as a record instead of pouring all of my time into social media. Although I have no idea what started this motivation, the last few weeks have proven that more and more people should be doing the same and <a href="/2021/03/22/the-value-of.html">putting some value</a> into the things they put on the internet.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/daa551975c.jpg" alt="My first WordPress Blog From June 2013"></p>
<p>In this time of turmoil and possible migration, don’t just fall into the same trap and do the same with Mastodon, or wherever you end up. There are some great services out there now that can provide you with a <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/pricing/19">cost-effective</a> way to turn your would be <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/4480-2/">tweet storms into blog posts</a> to make them yours, forever. I am a little bias towards micro.blog because, although not perfect, it offers you a great way to get started and start posting everything to one place.</p>
<p>My true hope with all this Twitter nonsense is that people start moving away from social media apart from for real communication, and that more thangs get published online. Blogging isn’t about putting 300+ words together in a nice little package and choosing the right images to go along with it. It can be anything you want it to be, your blog and your posts are your own and don’t need to conform to anyone else’s rules.</p>
<p>You will hear many blog supporters discuss ownership, the indieweb and even internet standards when getting preachy about having a blog. None of these really matter to most people, the real reason you need a blog is to showcase you. To have your little place online that isn’t affected by algorithms and billionaire babies. It’s just yours.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It’s rare that a trailer sparks any reaction in me. I often feel like I have watched the whole film, don’t you think they are too long nowadays and ruin it? Anyway, I saw one for the <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81387962">Netflix film Shutz</a> by Jonah Hill yesterday, and it sparked plenty of feelings. Something that I have been trying to work on myself over the last few months, and that’s just STFU and listening to people.</p>
<p>Pretty near the start, he says something that has echoed around my brain all day. “They just listen [therapists], and all your friends, who are idiots, give you advice. And you want your friends just to listen”. I’ve written before about me struggling to make many real life friends. The ones I have, I never unload my feelings onto them because I do not want them having to listen to my issues, but I have always been a good sounding board for them. People talk to me frequently about their issues, and I try to give the best advice I can.</p>
<p>I struggle with talking too much. I’m like a toddler, when I hear something that I have thoughts about I want to share them straight away. I do have a filter between brain and mouth, but it might be a little on the short side. Should I in fact, just shut up and listen more instead of giving out my advice. Typically, I have no experience of the situation they are experiencing and as such I am, as Jonah says, an idiot.</p>
<p>Flipping this on its head, I think I would talk to more people around me if they just listened. I don’t share my feeling with others, apart from on my blog, because I don’t need the advice, I just need to say my feelings out load. Much like my process for writing, talking though things often lets me come to a resolution on my own. I’d love to be listened to more. I’ve started watching the full film this morning and already written down loads of notes to refer to, so I might get more advice than I bargained for out of this.</p>

<p>I absolutely love the filters on Mastodon. I haven’t needed to use them much, but they actually mute the words properly. When compared to other services this is a breath of fresh air, I can really curate my feed to be what I want to see.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I distinctly remember watching this year&rsquo;s Apple event and being interested in absolutely nothing new. The yearly even that temps me into spending massive sums of money didn’t come across as well as usual. Most of the improvements were software anyway. Despite my bank balance thanking me, I felt a bit flat that I wouldn’t be picking up my usually iPhone and Apple Watch combination ready for my birthday in a couple of weeks time.</p>
<p>How wrong could I have been. Just a couple of months later, I am sat typing this out with an iPhone 14 Pro in my pocket and the most surprising hit of the year, an Apple Watch Ultra on my wrist. Whilst I like the iPhone, I would give it up with very little thought if I had too, however no one is taking this watch away from me now, and that shouldn’t be the case.</p>
<p>All of the Apple marketing tells me this watch is not for people like me. Sure I am relatively fit, despite health issues stopping me from running much, and I do like the outdoors. This watch is supposed to be for those that are levels above me. Divers, rock climbers, ultra distance runners, it’s not supposed to be for full-time dads and office workers, but here we are. All the improvements are just as useful in everyday life as they are for those Apple aim it at, and I adore it.</p>
<p>That’s it, review over. There are enough people out there that will walk you through specs and all the things that it can do, unfortunately I lack the ability to express the boring bits well and answer those types of questions you may have. What I can do though is tell you why and how this helps me in my daily life and hopefully help you see where it <em>could</em> be useful to you. This is pretty easy because there are not many areas that make a difference, but they add up to something that most people should consider.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/08bec90030.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="battery-life">Battery Life</h2>
<p>Presentations and marketing never give a true reflection of the type of usage you will get from Apple devices. They are pretty spot on, but no-one does the things they highlight. They don’t watch video playback on a MacBook Pro for 18 hours straight, and most people won’t be doing <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-watch-ultra/">60 hours worth of exercise</a> (low-power mode required). It’s even hard to work out what battery life would actually be like when comparing to the ‘regular’ Apple Watches “all day” but the Ultra will easily see you through three days.</p>
<p>I loose around 25% per 24 hours, including sleep tracking and at least one workout. Although occasionally, it seems to plummet at twice that rate until I reboot, which is bound to be something software related. Is this the best battery life on the market, no. Is this anything compared to a Garmin watch for example, no again. It is the best Battery life in an Apple Watch to date, and this means less to worry about.</p>
<p>The only ‘downside’ is that charging takes quite a while. Using a supported fast charger, it can get you from 25% ish up to 50+ in 30 mins, but it takes a while to top it up to full. I have mediated this by charging it most days for 30 minutes or so while I have a shower and get sorted for the day. This sees the battery life hover around 80-50% constantly and suits me much better than having to charge it for 90-minutes or so every few days.</p>
<p>I am over the moon with the improvements to battery life of the Apple Watch Ultra. I wear it constantly, use if for <a href="/2022/10/30/so-ive-finally.html">phone free days out</a>, and in my testing when I was trying to see how far it would get me I only lost 12% after 5 hours of hard use. If you&rsquo;re like me and want to be contactable, still be able to make payments and other modern things, but <a href="/2022/02/10/the-ultimate-minimalist.html">don’t want a phone around all the time</a>, the Apple Watch Ultra is the perfect device.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/22abfc4284.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="size--design">Size &amp; Design</h2>
<p>When I first thought about getting the Apple Watch Ultra was when people I knew began to receive them and use them. Sure, I’d seen the glossy images in press reviews and seen a few in video reviews, but once they were all over social media my opinions changed. The design that I thought was chunky and horrible, actually looked much better ‘in-person’. When compared to larger Casio watches the Apple Watch Ultra looks much nicer, to me at least.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all subjective. You may look at the raised lip to the flat screen, coupled with the crown guard, and think yuck. Some of my desire was just motivation to have something else, anything else, than the Apple Watch I had been wearing for years, but the Ultra version looks really impressive and feels great on my wrist. Even my tiny wrists. Seriously, I have to buy Size 6 braided loops and a S/M in the Orange Alpine Strap as seen in almost all press shots (it is nice though).</p>
<p>The great thing about the new design is that it doesn’t scream smartwatch. It’s obvious that it is one if you’re paying attention, but from everyday life, to the boardroom, the design looks more like a watch than the original design. The chunky design is not for everyone, and in fact more stylish watch brands are going the offsite way and slimming down, but it looks much better than the press photos would have you believe.</p>
<h3 id="comfortable">Comfortable</h3>
<p>The weird thing about this watch is, despite the increase in size, and it is a big watch, it&rsquo;s far more comfortable than other versions. The heart rate sensor doesn’t seem to push itself into my wrist as much, and the increased width makes the straps pull around my wrist rather than down. With the increased battery life, I tried sleeping in it, which I rarely did with the old one, and was surprised how comfortable it is.</p>
<p>Watch straps are a bit looser when compared with the regular ones, which makes perfect sense given that the watch itself is slightly bigger. This is only obvious with fixed length bands like my favourite braided loops.</p>
<h3 id="rough--ready">Rough &amp; Ready</h3>
<p>I have lost count the number of times I have accidentally scraped my watch on a wall, or knocked it on a door frame. Accidents happen in real life and although my sport versions always stood up OK, they always end their time with me with more than a few scrapes and chips. This new titanium version with the robust design gives me the confidence that I don’t have to worry about it. This is one of the great appeals of this watch, yes it can stand up to mountain climbing or whatever, but it will also resist being hit by a ‘ toy or fumbling it off its charger in the dark. It’s outdoor proof and also life proof.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/66b94c8d07.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="useable">Useable</h3>
<p>Many of the design changes are due to fitting in a much larger screen. I suppose 49 mm is not that much of a difference from 45, but that’s almost a 10% bump up. The new watchOS 9 exaggerates this further because the OS feels much larger than before, making interaction with the screen much easier. From swiping on the keyboard replying to a message to opening and using a app, it really is surprising what a difference a few mm make on a watch screen.</p>
<p>The screen is also much brighter when in use. This isn’t something that I noticed when using older versions, only when testing both side by side you do notice the stark difference. Making the screen much easier to see and use, especially when working out, when a quick glance is all you need to see all information on the nice big screen.</p>
<p>The screen is not the only thing that’s been improved, sure you’ll also get more accurate GPS and a depth sensor, but a massive improvement is the onboard speaker. Making it even more useful in daily life if, like me, you get phone calls at the worst possible time. I’m not saying people on the other end can’t tell they are on speaker, but you can hear them load and clear now whatever you are doing. When phone free, I’ve been making and receiving quite a few calls and the speaker makes a nice change to having to carry around my AirPods just in case.</p>
<h2 id="i-love-it">I Love It</h2>
<p>All of these things make the Apple Watch Ultra one of the best buys of the last few years. The battery life and small improvements all around have made me think less about it being a smartwatch, and more of a life assistant. I have the confidence it will do whatever I need it to do, whenever I need it. I can go phone free for hours on end as well as stand up to all the stresses and strains of my hectic lifestyle. It comes with me everywhere and I absolute love it.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that everyone should rush out and buy it. This is a £850 watch, after all. It won’t retain the value like spending the same money on a regular watch would do, and it won’t last nearly as long. However, it can aid your life in some very specific ways that I think plenty of people would enjoy. If you have the opportunity, try one out and see what it can do for you.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Turns out that I have more smaller thoughts than I thought (try saying that three times fast). Coupled with some nice feedback, has inspired me to publish some more bit sized posts for you to consume.</p>
<h2 id="the-happiness-privilege">The Happiness Privilege</h2>
<p>I’ve just finished <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781529396508">Happy, Sexy, Millionaire</a> by Steven Bartlet. It’s a pretty short book that doesn’t fall into the same trap most books with a similar message do and become a series of cherry-picked anecdotal stories. Near the start he discusses his pursuit of happiness, in that he started out with the wrong outlook and gives one of the most important outlooks that I’ve read for a while.</p>
<p>The premise is to not look for things to make you happy, but look for happiness instead. As he points out, just the sheer contemplation of wanting to change your life to be happy comes from an amazingly privileged place already.</p>
<p>The fact that you can even dare to think about changing things in your life to be more happy should make you stop and think. There is a massive section of the world that this simply isn’t an option, there is no other process than simply doing whatever they need to survive. We are all in an amazingly privileged place just to be reading this text and thinking about happiness, never forget that. You are already enough.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9c8cf84629.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="quiet-apathy">Quiet Apathy</h2>
<p>There’s a general belief that there are only two sides of every argument now. Commentators point to issues like Brexit and vaccinations that the world at large is moving further apart. There’s some truth in this, at least in my anecdotal observations, the world does seem further apart. However, that is because you only hear from both of these extreme sides, and the rest of us don’t care enough.</p>
<p>Take something like the online discourse around the COVID-19 vaccine. Peruse the online world, and you might think you’re either in the camp that got it as soon as possible, or you&rsquo;re an anti-vaxer. The truth is, the vast majority of people were somewhere in the middle. Positive about the advancements, but prefer a bit of a wait and see mentality. We don’t need to be split into camps, but the reality of the online world is that the other side of the argument is always wrong. Quiet apathy is the way to live life happily, have your opinions but don’t give a damn about other people&rsquo;s versions of them. Bliss.</p>
<h2 id="quote-of-the-week">Quote Of The Week</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake up in the day to find it was vanity, but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible - T.E. Lawrence</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="mastodon-for-companies">Mastodon For Companies</h2>
<p>I love the fact that Twitter is burning down. Not for the staff there, I hate that these talented people are without jobs or forced to have one they don’t like. But for the selfish fact it has got me to the stage where my need to visit has diminished, and I feel mush happier about the world.</p>
<p>The only thing I miss is being able to get in touch with brands. Many seem to prioritise support through Twitter and Facebook (neither of which I use) and sending them a tweet for help is easy to do. With this in mind I wondered what would happen if Twitter imploded, or the brand just didn’t want to be there any more, and I ran through a thought experiment where they all had Mastodon instances.</p>
<p>It would be straightforward to toot (I still hate that word) at a brand&rsquo;s customer service if they all become universal. For instance, all customer service could be <code>@cs@webaddress</code>, and you wouldn’t need to root around for anything. Amazon order not shown up, just message <code>@cs@amazon.co.uk</code> or had a bad experience in Tesco, reach out to <code>@cs@tesco.co.uk</code>. This opens up the ability to have those individuals who are representative of the brand, or otherwise want to be open to contact to have the ability, or you just have an internal social network too.</p>
<p>Yes, this relies on everyone understanding Mastodon and there are many that still don’t, but I think it’s a pretty nice idea. Thoughts?</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I was <a href="/2022/11/15/ive-been-working.html">pretty angry</a> this morning. With good reason, I thought at the time. I had lost 4-5 hours worth of work, but it still felt like a pointless emotion. It didn’t get me anywhere, changed absolutely nothing about the situation, and only made me feel worse.</p>
<p>Anger is, in most situations, a pointless emotion to feel. There must be some evolutionary advantages to feeling anger, but in the modern world in generally gets you nowhere. Even in combat, where you would think anger could be advantageous, it just clouds your judgement and increases the chance of mistakes.</p>
<p>Duncan Trussel <a href="https://overcast.fm/+OLq93D16s">put it fantastically</a> when he said that “anger is the second wound inflicted by your enemy”. Something he puts down to Buddha, but unfortunately, I can’t find any reference for it currently. Whoever said it, it is dead on. The only outcome is an wound on the person suffering with it, burnt by its toxic effects.</p>
<p>Anger does not bring back my work. In any situation, it doesn&rsquo;t change whatever has happened, it just affects the future negatively.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2022/11/10/ten-days-no.html"><h1 class="p-name">Ten Days No Twitter</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I feel as if I start every post about Twitter with the same words. I both love it and hate it, blah blah blah. Well, this time a billionaire baby annoyed me, so I quit for a bit and then decided to set myself a new monthly challenge. I’m 10 days into “No Twitter November” and I have a few observations.</p>
<h2 id="theitch">The Itch</h2>
<p>I’ve known for a long while I’ve had a deep-rooted muscle memory <a href="/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html">Twitter itch</a>. Despite all of my attempts, I can’t stop my unconscious brain from grabbing a device and opening Twitter whenever I am bored. I do it without thinking, and often only catch myself after minutes of doom scrolling.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this has dried up fairly quickly, but I’m not going to lie, the first few days were frustratingly bad. I had to make sure I had signed out everywhere and had no apps installed. The sight of the sign in screen was good enough to jar me back into the real world and stop me from going any further. In the last couple of days it has only happened twice when compared to the first few days occurring a couple of times <em>an hour</em>.</p>
<p>Using Mastodon a bit more has helped / replaced this, so I feel like I am cheating a bit. However, that place doesn’t give me the same hate filled rage and leave me feeling deflated, so it’s a net win.</p>
<h2 id="thelogged-outexperiencesucks">The Logged-Out Experience Sucks</h2>
<p>There are a few newsletters I subscribe to that include some funny tweets, or useful threads to check out. Mostly these show fine, but others require a tap, and if they do, I am usually immediately hit with pop-ups to sign in and “join the conversation”. It sucks that I can’t consume the information logged out, but I expect nothing less.</p>
<p>I debated log and hard if even reading these tweets constituted cheating, but concluded it didn’t. This was further confirmed given the terrible experience if I’m logged out anyway. Every so often you can see what you need to and the screen is taken over if you scroll down, sometimes you’re blocked entirely. It sucks.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/36147889bc.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="75ofmediareliesontwitter">75% Of Media Relies On Twitter</h2>
<p>After a few days of no Twitter, I began to see it everywhere. At first, I put this down to some kind of withdrawal, but it soon became obvious how much of the news sites, personal blogs and YouTube were covering things that happened on or about Twitter.</p>
<p>Granted, this was exaggerated by the baby billionaire doing his best to burn it down. There aren’t many “did you see what happened on Twitter” water cooler moments, but a gigantic percentage of news is about what so-and-so tweeted or other things linked to the service. I now entirely understand why journalists feel like they are chained to checking Twitter. Which leads me to my last point.</p>
<h2 id="imisspeople">I Miss People</h2>
<p>There are a few people who have joined me on my jump from Twitter, but many have not. I miss the interaction I got (no matter how small) from people that I’ve met over the years. Reading their life updates and learning new things they are up to.</p>
<p>Some of this has moved to a group chat, but it doesn’t feel the same. I do miss Twitter when it’s good, and I wish there was some way to make it work, but the longer I spend off the service, the more I realise it is the right thing to do. Perhaps in time I will realise that this space in my brain is better used elsewhere, but presently I miss it. There are a few people that I only interact with on Twitter, so I’ve had to stalk people’s Instagram or find another way to contact them.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I do see myself dipping my toe back in, but perhaps in a much reduced basis. It may take more time to work out the way I am going to gain the little community I had, but I think it can also be built elsewhere too. There’s another 20 days to go, so things might change by then, I’ll let you know.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Since ditching my newsletter a while a go, I haven’t really had a place to share smaller thoughts with the world. It was effortless to fill it full of things that took up some space in my brain and perhaps would make a good talking point, but wasn’t worthy of a blog post. So, I’ve decided to publish them every so often anyway and see how it goes. Welcome to some small thoughts I have had over the last week or so.</p>
<h2 id="systems-and-tools">Systems and tools</h2>
<p>It doesn’t matter what you are trying to do, the system is the most important thing to get right. Look at what you need to achieve and then work backwards in a realistic step process. Once done, the tools you choose will fall around the system. If you don’t get everything straight, you can fall into the trap of letting the tools dictate the system itself. If a tool I use can’t do the job I want it to do, do I then find a different tool or change my system and expectations?</p>
<p>The risk is that changing your tools every time is costly, in both time and money, but if a tool doesn’t fit the system or do what you want it to do, it breaks the system. Working out what you <em>really</em> need to achieve is the only way to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Look at note-taking, for example. Numerous people are told “you need to take notes like this” or “use this app to achieve this specific thing” instead of working out where they must be to make it work. My <a href="/2022/08/04/my-system-notes.html">note-taking system</a> was broken for a long time. Not in terms of taking notes, but using the notes later on. Linking between thoughts and surfacing ideas has never worked as well as it thought it should. This made me l<a href="/2022/02/15/link-posts-from.html">ook around constantly</a> for new tools to do this, when in reality when I stopped and thought about it, I never used them anyway.</p>
<p>Is your system broken, or your tools?</p>

<h2 id="different-photos-different-places">Different Photos, Different Places</h2>
<p>I figured something out last week to do with photo services. I post <a href="/2022/10/03/taking-the-shot.html">different photos</a> to different places. Instagram gets a bit more editing and only a few chosen photos. I usually then posted more natural ones to Glass <a href="/2022/08/08/for-the-sake.html">when I used it</a>, and then I am perfectly happy dumping all the rest on my blog / micro.blog.</p>
<p>The different places seem to be set up for different things. I would never dream of posting anything personal to Glass. It feels too much like a pro photographer&rsquo;s place to share the best of the best. Like what Instagram should be without all the gaming and attention seeking that plagues an otherwise great platform.</p>
<p>I sometimes found myself shooting a photo slightly differently, or editing a different version for Instagram. Which often leave me feeling a bit strange. Typically, photos I don’t even like do better on Instagram because they have a similar look and feel to others, but I edit how I like when I post to my blog.</p>
<h2 id="quote-of-the-week">Quote of the week</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe, I need to make peace with the fact that I cannot keep up. I cannot keep up with the growing list of brilliant books. I cannot keep up with the gifted writers churning beautiful essays. And, with a heavy heart, accept that I am okay with it. <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/08/14/no-end-to.html">No End to Content Overload - Excursions</a></p></blockquote>
<h2 id="because-of-instagram">Because Of Instagram</h2>
<p>“The modern world is stupid” says every old man who wants to shake his fist confused. Me included. I don’t get most of the business decisions today, and most of the marketing I see is just bizarre. Which is somewhat worrying because that’s what I’m supposed to know about for my day job. I do understand where most of it has come from, and the influence of Instagram cannot be understated.</p>
<p>There’s a whole world of products and businesses out there built solely because of the instagram effect. They have designed their products, and sometimes entire practices, to appeal to a certain ascetic and sell things to the Instagram (and now TikTok) generation. This isn’t just something that appeals to Gen-Z either. The amount of money that I have spent on experiences and products purely because my wife wants to post to Instagram is more than I care to admit.</p>

<h1 id="an-ode-to-quick-note">An ode to quick note</h1>
<p>It took Apple a while, but they finally made Apple notes truly useful on my iPhone. Yes, there are still things they need to improve, like the terrible implementation of rich text, but quick note is a revelation and the cornerstone of everything I need to capture whilst using my phone.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter where I am, <a href="/2022/08/02/writing-instead-of.html">what I am doing</a>, but within seconds I can take a note. By adding a small icon to control centre, and also allowing me to swipe up on the iPad, I’ve turbocharged my note-taking and also saved myself some money. I no longe rely on an app like Drafts, to make sure I can take a quick note — I love Quick note.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Although <a href="https://gr36.status.lol/636179534308c">my monthly challenge</a> forbids me from checking Twitter, my reading stream and other social media is full of Twitter news. I honestly couldn’t care less what the business does, and what Elmo turns his attention on to monetise its user base, but most of the chatter seems to be about blue check marks and paying for subscriptions. Weirdly, I’ve been thinking about this for years and have a few thoughts.</p>
<p>The main issue is my confusion around what Verified means on Twitter. The word just seems wrong in the context that Twitter puts on it. Never fitting in to any mental model I can come up with. The way in which it is portrayed certainly needs refreshing if not removing, but the blue check already carries its own weight after years of use.</p>
<p>Verified should mean ‘this person is who they say they are’. In so far as Twitter have carried out some checks, perhaps uploading an ID and placing some code in your website, and as far as they can tell, this person is real. The user is then verified, but it shouldn’t have the importance that Twitter places on it currently.</p>
<p>To Twitter, Verified means that this person is who they say they are, but they represent the way Twitter wants to portray its service. In as much as, if you don’t conform and break some unwritten rules, the first strike for Twitter is often to remove the user&rsquo;s Verified badge. A weird way to work when you can call the service anything you like, yet chose your marker as ‘Verified’.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/de93a8ad23.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="how-i-would-fix-verified">How I Would Fix Verified</h2>
<p>For years, I have wanted a Twitter pro that is worth paying for. Solving the platform&rsquo;s biggest problem and also gaining some income. Whilst I understand that the way Twitter works, fast-paced and with a massive reach, is its USP. Most of the issues users face is due to bots and anonymous users.</p>
<p>I feel users should be able to prove who they say they are and get a blue check mark. You shouldn’t <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-reverses-real-names-policy-apologizes/">be forced to use your name</a> or other downfalls of similar ideas, but Twitter should be able to tell who you are and therefore be answerable for your conduct. As a perk, users can decide to <em>only</em> interact with others that are verified and have robust filtering in place to only see those users. If Twitter wants you to pay, fine, that’s their call, but users need useful features in exchange for money.</p>
<p>Twitter could then extend this towards other markers for people that represent whatever it is that they mark people as Verified currently. Perhaps a gold checkmark, or a deferent thing all together. This still may not resolve the issues currently plaguing it, nor pull me back, but it would perhaps go some way to addressing the current issues.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2022/10/27/apple-ad-store.html"><h1 class="p-name">Apple Ad Store</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There’s very little for me to comment on or add value to the conversation around Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/22/apple-announces-more-app-store-ads/">showing adverts</a> on their devices. There are many more knowledgable about the situation than I, and couple with the fact I don’t care currently, means I stay quiet. That said, the recent moaning makes me think back to the days I used to love Samsung phones and the biggest reason I quit was ads.</p>
<p>That’s right, dear reader, I once very nearly switch to Samsung around the Galaxy Fold 2 / <a href="/2020/10/06/samsung-galaxy-note.html">Note 20 Ultra</a> era. They were great phones and I enjoyed using them to review, but what put me off in the end was that I felt like I was the product. Adverts would constantly be displayed in Samsung apps, such as Pay. They even went as far as sending notifications and adverts right <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-ads-your-samsung-phone">in your notification area</a> at some points. All of which completely put me off dealing with the company.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/eccbe0a8d2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you buy a cheap device, you expect companies to bundle in services and try to push you towards spending more money. You don’t, however, expect this when you spend upwards of £1,200 on a phone like the Fold 2 or Note 20 Ultra. Granted Samsung are possibly the worst offender in this space, and do similar things with their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/co5aw4/unremovable_ads_on_my_2500_samsung_smart_tv/">expensive TVs</a>, so we might be comparing Apples to Oranges, but it just feels off.</p>
<p>I absolutely expect a company to be pushed to make more and more money, and I understand that people have a strange perception of Apple as a whole, but it’s starting to feel a bit weird all of a sudden. There is nothing immediate to worry about, but after years and years of Apple telling us they don’t do adverts and <a href="https://gadgets360.com/internet/news/tim-cook-to-google-users-youre-not-the-customer-youre-the-product-594242">yelling at other companies</a> that treat their <a href="https://sigma.world/news/you-are-no-longer-the-customer-you-are-the-product-tim-cook/">customers as products</a>, it feels like the tide is turning.</p>
<p>Granted, these are only feelings, ones based on experiences with the worst of the worst, but I understand where some users are coming from. If we continue down this road, it could very well end up a disaster. However, rightly or wrongly, I do have faith that Apple will do this correctly. Unfortunately, I can look at the trashy adverts in Apple News and see a world where Tim Cook can’t be so preachy any more.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’ve been trying to formulate in my mind what I want to achieve with publishing online and my online life in general. Not to achieve like the world of content creation, worrying about metrics and income, but really what I do it for. What is the yardstick to measure things against if you aren&rsquo;t really concerned about the yards or the stick that people usually use? My publishing and my browsing habits really come down to three things — tools used, time available and the energy I have.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>In my modern life, I nearly always have enough tools available all the time. I do most of my <a href="/2022/10/03/mobile-publishing.html">writing on my iPhone</a>, this is in stark contrast to even a few months ago where I would always default to using my Mac. By choosing this separation, it felt a bit more organised and if I sat down to write, I wrote. Whereas now when I have an idea I capture it, or more often than not write the post there and then.</p>
<p>This means that my fingers could nearly always be busy. There are a few moments that I don’t have my phone with me, but I can always capture ideas because there is never a time I don’t have <a href="/2022/10/19/falling-for-the.html">my Apple Watch on</a>. Tools are seldom my problem now I’ve sorted out my publishing workflow.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/413cef77a6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="time">Time</h2>
<p>The biggest thing we all struggle with is time. Finding this in between all the things you have to do in our daily grind can be a task in itself. Thankfully, much like exercising, I can prioritise these above plenty of other things. For me, time spent scrolling social media or watch TV is better spent writing in a journal or publishing a blog post. My only comparison is against what else I could be doing because writing or reading others writing gives me lots of value.</p>
<p>With that said, others will value things differently. Some play games to unwind, some are artists, and some love doing nothing in front of the TV. There is no right or wrong here, just the result of lots of thinking and the occasional <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMusjixdf10">values audit</a>.</p>
<h2 id="energy">Energy</h2>
<p>For me, writing doesn’t always take a lot of time, but it takes some mental energy. A certain level of motivation needs to be achieved to get an idea from a small note into a publishable article. I used to take much less care of things, but despite the scruffy appearance of my blog posts, I do send some time on them.</p>
<p>Energy is also a big decider of where I want to put my reserves when I’ve been at work all day. Writing copy and staring at a computer all day doesn’t always mix very well with wanting to do the same thing when I come home. This is combatted somewhat by my mobile publishing workflow, but occasionally, my remaining energy is better off focused elsewhere. Playing with the kids or completing the endless lists of home jobs I have to do often gets priority here.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/96cb4d2afa.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>
<p>It all comes down to this. What do I want to achieve by writing the posts and publishing it? I am always conscious of not writing things to get replies and attention, and would rather get things out that help people. That might be to teach someone a new way of doing something tech related, or just show my thoughts behind topics I am thinking about.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I try to make sure that I don’t <a href="/2021/02/11/needing-feedback.html">expect anything in return</a> for the posts that I write, and that I am fine with that. The result is that I want to help others, or just get the thoughts that I am typing out to a conclusion and at which point I might as well publish them anyway. My blog posts are often a public journal of sorts and cover the topics and concerns I have at the time of writing. I do often wonder why I bother publishing things, but the result is always because I like to, and that&rsquo;s enough for me.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2022/10/19/falling-for-the.html"><h1 class="p-name">Falling For The Apple Watch Again</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>As with everything in my technology life, I go backwards and forwards on the Apple Watch. On one hand, it gives me the perfect device to <a href="/2022/02/10/the-ultimate-minimalist.html">take me away from technology</a>, and on the other it’s another device to maintain and worry about. I’m always one for making my life easier and cutting tech out my life if I can do. With that said, after a bit of work and a few Shortcuts, I have fallen for it again.</p>
<p>Following a <a href="/2022/06/08/unplugging-should-be.html">little time unplugged,</a> I had been toying with the idea of putting my Apple Watch away for good. Whilst it did add some value into my life, I had come to the conclusion that it wasn’t enough. I held on a little longer due to rumours of a redesigned version in the upcoming months, so I kept my options open. I’m not a fan of this elongated squircle and have always wanted <a href="/2019/04/06/i-want-a.html">something more stylish</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/10f8913784.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Thankfully, the released Apple Watch Ultra didn’t really appeal to me, apart from my desire for <a href="/2022/09/24/i-think-i.html">something different on my wrist</a>. I blame Maique for this slightly because he <a href="https://micro.blog/maique/13513088">highlighted the usefulness</a> of the new action button he is using for updating his <a href="/2022/10/17/how-i-use.html">omg.lol Status</a>. Instead of spending £850 on a watch that would not suit my wrist just for a button, I have put some effort into making <em>my</em> Apple Watch work for me and in response, I love wearing it again.</p>
<p>The way I have done this, and the Shortcuts I have set up, are uniquely for me and not really the point of this post. It is more to point out how versatile technology can be with a little effort. By making the Apple Watch mine, within the very tight realms of what Apple allows, makes it much more useful. An Apple Watch could never replace other devices, but I can put my phone down even more so than before.</p>
<p>I would still like to see an action button on updated versions but for the time being I am very happy. This tiny computer on my wrist isn’t so bad after all.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2022/10/19/the-ipad-kind.html"><h1 class="p-name">The iPad Kind Of Sucks Now</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’ve been mulling over these thoughts for months now, but resisted on posting them because of the backlash. I know I should never do that, and feel free to post what I want, but you know what the internet is like. Following yesterday&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/10/apple-unveils-completely-redesigned-ipad-in-four-vibrant-colors/">meagre offering</a> following 18 months of development, the time has come. The iPad sucks now, and that’s a real shame.</p>
<p>I used to be that guy. The one that used his iPad for everything and preached about it at every available opportunity. Selling the iPad to anyone that would listen and teaching people the tricks you needed to make it really work. This was way back on an original iPad Air, then a long line of Pro variations. Then one day I just kind of ‘woke up’.</p>
<p>I had an epiphany and realised that it wasn’t the iPad that was so great. I mean it was good, and Apple were doing what they needed to do, but it was the apps and particularly Shortcuts that made it. Apple broke several of my much-needed shortcuts to get things done, and the whole thing fell apart.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cca9f7d8c9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html">So I quit</a>. Publicly and emotionally, I’d had enough of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole. Fortunately, Apple now sells a perfect replacement for those that like myself spent thousands on iPad Pros with keyboards and pencils in the form of the M1 MacBooks. I chose the Max variant in an MacBook Pro, but many switched to the new Air and spent <em>less</em>.</p>
<p>I didn’t care so much for ‘pro apps’. Or for them to allow me to use external monitors correctly. All I wanted was for them to stop messing around with the way the iPad actually worked and decide what it wanted to be. At the point of quitting, the iPad existed in somewhat of an oxymoronic state, in that it was costly but not all that capable. The software was flakey and didn’t really ever live up to the promises Apple made.</p>
<p>The iPad still exists in that same position, but the terms are worse. My initial quitting was three years ago and nothing has changed. There has been some kind of awakening of late. One where users that previously waved their ’iPad guy’ flag have realised they are indeed doing themselves a disservice. The reality is unless you explicitly need a touchscreen, the iPad Pro is a poor, expensive, choice. Apple still has no idea what they want the iPad to be, and even less of an idea on the ‘pro’ versions.</p>
<p>Base model iPads now come in at £500. Which is at least £100 more expensive than you should be paying for a consumption device. Sure, it can work with keyboards and pencils (kind of), but that’s not the appeal of an entry-level tablet. Couple this with a confused lineup of Airs and unimproved £1000+ pro devices, leaves next to no appeal.</p>
<p>The answer to the age-old question of “what iPad should I buy” is now “last year&rsquo;s model”. Should anyone dare to ask what tablet they can get to do some work on might need some follow-up questions, but in reality the correct reply is “a Surface Pro”. That hurts a little.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2022/10/17/how-i-use.html"><h1 class="p-name">How I Use OMG.lol Statuses</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The fun little service <a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a> is the new hotness on micro.blog and seems to be seeping out into the wider internet. Not only is it ridiculously cheap for what you get, the developer Adam seems to be making constant updates and offering more and more value for money. For just £5 per year you get access to a landing page for your social media, mastodon instance, email forwarding and my favourite service — statuslog.</p>
<p>Statuslog allows you to post small updates containing whatever you wish, along with an emoji. Exactly the type of thing that allows you to share what you are up to without having to interact with a service. As with everything omg.lol creates, it’s brilliantly designed and easy to customise for your use.</p>
<h2 id="statusonmyblog">Status On My Blog</h2>
<p>I have embraced the set-up of micro.blog. It promotes using your blog for shorter posts as well as longer ones to keep hold of your content. There are just some posts that I don’t care about, and are what Twitter was really made for. Short, to the point life updates, that have no value — think “drinking coffee” and not tweet storms of information.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/e6a68339d4.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>I put the status card right at the top of my blog home page, so should anyone land on it, they can see what I am currently up to. The level of usefulness is debatable, but I like it! For a full walk through of getting this set up see the help page <a href="https://home.omg.lol/info/statuslog">here</a>, but in short I put in the following code.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script src="https://status.lol/[your-address].js?time&amp;link&amp;fluent&amp;pretty"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="styling">Styling</h3>
<p>Thankfully, the styling of the status card looks great out the box, so it’s rare you will have to do anything. I wanted it to look more like part of my blog, so I styled a few elements. This took me a bit of trial and error to get this correct. When I first implemented by own changes, I used the <code>&amp;pretty</code> on the end of the script and simply styled the areas I wanted. However, this now uses some <code>!important</code> styling and as such breaks any custom styling you want to override.</p>
<p>To style the status card, you will need to remove <code>&amp;pretty</code> from the script above and style <em>everything</em> in CSS. The default CSS used at the time of writing is below, however this could change at any time.</p>
<pre><code>.statuslol_container {
<p>},</p>
<p>.statuslol {
display: flex;
flex-wrap: wrap;
gap: 1em;
background: #e7ebf3;
color: #111;
border-radius: .5em;
padding: 1em;
}</p>
<p>.statuslol_emoji_container {
flex: 0 0 1em;
font-size: 3em;
padding-right: 0;
}</p>
<p>.statuslol_content {
flex-grow: 1;
flex-shrink: 1;
flex-basis: 0;
margin: -.5em 0 0 0;
text-align: left;
overflow-wrap: break-word;
overflow-wrap: anywhere;
color: #111 !important;
}</p>
<p>.statuslol_time {
opacity: .5; color: #111 !important;
}
</code></pre></p>
<p>You can then go for your life, change anything and everything you want to, and make it look to your taste. I love the stock gradient of the card, but implemented my own darker version I found on <a href="https://uigradients.com/#Quepal">UI Gradients</a>.</p>
<h2 id="postingstatuses">Posting Statuses</h2>
<p>For a long time, I have wanted to be able to post tweets without actually opening the app. This used to be straightforward with Shortcuts (née Workflow) but the best you can do now is transfer text into the app to tweet from it. This is where the excellent statuslog service comes in. I use it to post a short update, which is posted to micro.blog, Twitter and Mastodon.</p>
<p>If you are a Drafts user, you can use a <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2DT">really nice action</a> to update your status easily. However, I am not, so after some inspiration from micro.blog user and omg.lol unofficial ambassador <a href="https://micro.blog/maique/13513088">Maique </a> I created a Shortcut to do this. You can grab the shortcut from <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2be68317c569484781cea2ca32c8b03c">here</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/298c6757ab.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>To use this Shortcut, you will need an API key for your OMG.LOL account, that can be found <a href="https://home.omg.lol/account#api-key">here</a>, and also put your account username in the other box as outlined on importing the Shortcut. As you can see, I have added this to my Home Screen for easy access and made an icon, which is below.</p>
<figure><img src="uploads/2024/7bbfda8759.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Icon available <a href="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7bbfda8759.jpg">here</a></p>
<p>If you then wish to then import the status into micro.blog the RSS feed you will need is <code>http://[your-address].status.lol/feed</code> replace your address with yours. If you do not use micro.blog there are automation services such as <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> that can Tweet whenever an RSS feed is updated.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It’s that time of year again. At the point where our business starts to get a little less busy and other staff start catching up on their projects, mine takes off. There’s no reason for it, but something always crops up or needs competing each year, so I’m a little used to it by now. Last year we decided to redesign all of our brochures and then launch a new website the week before Christmas!</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s task has completely taken me out of my comfort zone. Even though a large portion of my work is design, I’ve never been good at original illustration. A sliding it like the plague and relying on others to do the heavy lifting. Low and behold, this project requires loads of it and has been stressing me out, lots.</p>
<p>So much, so I could not sleep last night due to worrying about things I was not happy with. Not a great felling, but ultimately, I <a href="https://twitter.com/gr36/status/1581206616149368832?s=46&amp;t=L5bOxTFXcObW64cqE8Y5hQ">gave up at 4am on Saturday</a> and worked it through. A few hours later, I’m happier with the outcome and have actually developed my skills no end. This bit of pressure has pushed me to work on skills that I avoid if I can do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s still a long way to go for this project, and I am still no artist, but the pressure has actually helped.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On reflection, I would have to conclude that the ethics of early Buddhism do not offer blanket solutions to all the complex predicaments of the human situation. Perhaps that was never their intention—perhaps their intention was to issue guidelines rather than proclaim moral absolutes, to posit ideals even for those who cannot perfectly fulfill them. Nevertheless, the complexity of the human condition inevitably confronts us with circumstances in which moral obligations run at crosscurrents.</p></blockquote>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I thought for a long time that the pandemic had ruined me. Despite being one of the lucky ones and not being greatly affected by it outside the obvious, I have never felt the same since. The <a href="/2022/07/27/210805.html">pins and needles I feel in my brain</a> has gone into overdrive and I feel constantly burnt out.</p>
<p>I’ve recognised this, and for quite a while I have been trying to get back to the way I was before the pandemic. Don’t get me wrong, the 18 or so months suffering its wrath did not ruin me, but I just don’t feel myself anymore. I don’t think I am alone in this, but it is more obvious because during the lockdowns I weirdly managed to shine. Dealing with a crisis suits me well, and remaining calm and collected under pressure is fairly easy. Unfortunately, the adrenaline and focus have now gone, replaced by emptiness and a sense of being lost.</p>
<p>In the little over 9 months the UK spent really struggling to get things under control, I became the fittest and healthiest I have been for years. The fact we were all at home together meant I had time and space outside of working to really exercise. I <a href="/2020/05/18/getting-injured-was.html">discovered my love of cycling</a> on empty roads, and despite my waking hours seemingly being separated by the hours I drank coffee and those I consume beer, I thrived.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a44054af3b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>My spiral down began two weeks before Christmas 2021 when I had my COVID-19 vaccine booster shot. It knocked me off my feet for weeks. So much so, my heart and lungs have never been the same since. I am still exhausted when doing small things, but I can still run a little, providing I break through an invisible barrier and manage to keep going. I have no idea what is up with me, and no doctor will listen to what I need to fix. As such my mental health has suffered dramatically, being able to exercise is one of my only enjoyments in life.</p>
<p>I am trying really hard to get back to where I was, but being nearly 40 I feel like my body is fighting me at every step. I yearn to be back to where I was in what feels like the blink of an eye ago, but that dream always seems out of sight. No matter the effort I put in, no matter the dedication I have, I just can’t reach the proverbial carrot on a stick. In many ways, I am mourning the loss of myself, but I will not accept the me I am now. There was to be a return to normal somewhere down the line, and it best be soon.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Over the years, I have become used to most of my life being like swimming in the sea. Bobbing up and down and having to work with the environment to get the best out of my experience. There is absolutely no point in me trying to swim against the tide, nor ignoring the waves for risk of them breaking over my head. It’s best to just ride it out.</p>
<p>There have been points where I have tried to force it. <a href="/2020/08/17/sitting-in-the.html">Sitting in my chair</a>, and fretting over writing something because last week it was easy. When in reality I had obsoletely nothing that I <a href="/2021/11/19/something-to-say.html">needed nor wanted to say</a> at that point. I have attempted to break through walls and run distances simply because I used to be able to do it, when in reality the tide was on its way out.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8e7193da11.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In contrast, there have been times when I have struggled through the adversity. Smashed through the wall and taken much more away from the experience. Run personal bests following a moment of dread before lacing up my trainers and doing it anyway. The sweetest victories are those that I fought uphill, against the grain, and at points thought about quitting.</p>
<p>When the tide swells, I’ve learnt to just go with it. My inspiration is something I have to take advantage of while it is there and publish thoughts as they arise. I have to capitalise on motivation to exercise when it is there to make sure I can have down days and not feel bad about it. The most important thing I have to do is listen to myself and understand why. To discover in myself the reason for having to ride the waves to avoid drowning, when some days I’m carried forward by them.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There’s a lot more I can say on this topic that I am currently motivated to type out. After being a faithful Pocket subscriber for years, I switched to Matter months ago and have never looked back. Well, maybe <a href="/2022/10/02/recommended-reading.html">once or twice</a>.</p>
<p>Among a slew of new ’read it later’ apps, Matter stands out as it&rsquo;s what everyone seems to use. It’s the new hotness, and most of that is because it <a href="/2022/02/15/link-posts-from.html">plugs into everything</a> and allows you to <a href="/2022/08/20/the-fact-i.html">do more with your reading</a>. This is the only reason I am still using it, despite it ripping out all the social features I loved.</p>
<p>That is a little tongue in cheek, but my real worry is how exactly this is going to make money. No doubt this will be a subscription service in the not too distant future, and I expect a significantly priced one considering the development that has gone into it. This worries me because of the level of data I have invested in an app that I don’t know how much they will sting me for. In comparison to an effectively free service offered by Pocket.</p>
<p>The rest of the questions on comparing the apps is what you want from them. They both achieve similar things. Matter has the ability for you to add in newsletters and RSS feeds, whereas Pocket surfaces much better recommended articles. When it comes the reading itself they are both on equal footing, which just about every other competing app is.</p>
<h1 id="in-short">In Short</h1>
<p>Pocket is like a reliable pickup truck that’s getting on a bit. It’s been built for a specific job and does it very well. It’s not filled full of the latest tech, and you don’t see any upgrades coming. However, you know what you are getting. It’s reliable and will be around for years to come.</p>
<p>Matter is a Tesla. It&rsquo;s the latest and greatest, filled full of all the toys and plugs into all sorts of extensions. You’ll need to get used to a few quirks though and learn how to use it best. The problem is: We don’t really know how long it will last and how much it’s going to cost us eventually.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with either option, but there will be one that fits you best.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>My blog has being going for almost a decade. In that time, technology has transformed my life and the way I write has gone through some pretty major shifts. What was first typed into a frustratingly slow WordPress installation can now be published from a variety of apps with surprising ease, and often now straight from my phone.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, publishing from a mobile isn’t new. I was doing everything from my iPad for years, and this is the same. More of a realisation of the true power that smartphones and the internet hold for us. There’s a lot of doom and gloom surrounding them, and more and more people wanting to ditch them (<a href="/2021/04/16/back-as-far.html">myself included</a>) but you are mistaken if you think it is all bad news.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2d67eb5d85.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s remarkable that I am currently sat in my car waiting, <a href="/2022/09/16/constantly-waiting.html">as I always do</a>, and typing out my thoughts to instantly post online. I might even spell check them first! This is my pushback against the thousands of posts I see telling anyone that will listen how bad their phone is. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been there, all the minimalism people ask you to ditch it and that used to get me down. Currently <a href="/2021/08/26/minimalism-and-big.html">I choose a big phone because I can do things on it</a> that I would usually need a regular computer for. I can shape and mould this tool to enable me to do things and at the same time be aware of the downsides.</p>
<p>Publishing is my thing, and the fact I can do it all the time in situations where I might otherwise be bored or <a href="/2022/08/02/writing-instead-of.html">scrolling social media</a> should be appreciated. I can see myself doing this more and more as time goes on, and it gives a nice contrast when I sit at my computer all day doing other things.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2022/10/03/thanks-elon-i.html"><h1 class="p-name">Thanks Elon, I Feel Much Better About Myself Now</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There’s some crazy weirdness surrounding Elon Musk. He’s the darling child of what seems like all the internet, but <a href="https://time.com/6171726/elon-musk-fake-followers/">most of his followers</a> are paid for. Unfortunately for someone held in such high regard by tech bros everywhere as some kind of god, his <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23108357/redacted-version-of-exhibits-a-j-to-letter-to-the-honorable-kathaleen-st-j-mccormick-from-edward-b.pdf">phone records have revealed</a> his ideas actually kind of suck, and he’s surround by sycophantic suck ups.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go into the ins and outs of what is contained in his texts and emails, there are more intelligent people than I to do that. What I will say is that reading some of these summarisations has made me feel much better about my business life. No longer am I held back by the ideas that some of them might suck. As <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/elon-musk-texts-twitter-trial-jack-dorsey/671619/">Charlie Warzel</a> pointed out, “Whoever said there are no bad ideas in brainstorming never had access to Elon Musk’s phone”.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f8e238e7bf.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There truly are some absolute stinkers that come from both Elon and his long list of suck ups. Two of my favourites are Elon suggesting that people pay to tweet (at a cost of 0.1 Dodge Coin) and Jason Calacanis having “the best idea ever for monetization,”. His world-changing brain fart was charging famous people to be able to spam their followers with DMs. This is without the several conversations that exist in which they try to “solve free speech”.</p>
<p>Never again am I going to chastise myself for having poor ideas, or even a lack of good ones. Clearly not the only reason, but a large part of people like Musk’s success comes down to finance backing and the availability of opportunity. Which is about as far away from what we are led to believe. We are told that the reason he is so successful is his ridiculously long days, or his tenacious attitude to working. Not the billions in the bank, and being surrounded by people that can provide opportunities to thrive.</p>
<p>Both of these things are true of Musk, and he does a much better job of application than I ever could. However, peaking into his phone records gives me a behind the curtain glimpse. Allowing me to understand the real workings of those in successful positions. My ideas might sometimes suck, but they don’t suck as bad as this, and if they did, I would keep it to myself!</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The best advice I give anyone who wants to become good at something, is to do it. <a href="/2020/08/17/sitting-in-the.html">Constantly and consistently</a>, become obsessed and love the practice. This goes double for photography. Unfortunately, I think social media has ruined the expectation of taking photos and that really sucks.</p>
<p>I was at one time worried about only taking photos that everyone likes. Studying the settings people used and trying to recreate shots that others had taken. I spent far too long picking through Instagram to find shots for places I was due to visit. Looking for the right angles and interesting things to look at. I learnt a lot, but it ruined my motivation for photography for a while because I always felt I didn’t live in an interesting enough place.</p>
<p>Like most things, Instagram is a photography version of comparing your <a href="/2021/05/31/insides-vs-outsides.html">insides to someone else’s outsides</a>. All I began to see was crystal clear, pin sharp images that had been edited perfectly, and my shots never looked like the ones I wanted to recreate. The reality is that I didn’t <a href="/2021/08/04/other-peoples-trash.html">see their trash can</a>, nor the times that tried to shoot things and missed, I just saw the best of the best. My shots were never going to live up to the standard I thought I should be at and that sucked.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c31fc74f30.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Thankfully, I quickly realised that I wasn’t taking shots for other people. I was taking them for me and wanted something different from everyone else anyway. An easy way to do this was to take pictures of things, rather than capturing moments. I began to focus on things that caught my eye and rare moments that were unlikely to be seen again. Unfortunately, this can lead to instances where I only gain a handful of shots I am happy with despite hours of shooting. Or more often than I care to admit, they all went in the bin!</p>
<p>As my interests change to street photography, the chances of poor outings increase dramatically, so my motivation can take a hit occasionally. That doesn’t mean I will stop taking them, though. That one shot I am pleased with is worth the grind of getting nothing at all.</p>

      <p>Since Matter chose to <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/nucleus">remove all of their social sharing features</a>, I’ve lacked things to read. As much as they claim to have improved things in getting recommendations direct from Twitter, they really suck. There is nothing better than learning what the people around you are reading to let you know what to take a peek at, and I wish more services understood that.</p>
<p>I have a particular hatred <a href="/2021/01/10/american-politics-gets.html">of American politics</a> and its ability to worm its way into everything. Covering all of social media with its poison and then infiltrating everything that large-scale services suggest I should read. However, that issue is much larger than one topic. Matter now surfaces hardly any posts that I want to read, which means I don’t read as much. It is not clear how the recommendations work, but clearly, some people are reading these posts, but that person is not me.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/245e97bf49.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It sounds like I am ripping on one particular service, but I am not. In fact, I love Matter, it is one of the first apps I install on a new phone, but all services seem to do this now. Taking recommendations from too broad a selection of people, or making all the suggested posts human-curated. This may work for some people, but again, not I.</p>
<p>In a world of algorithms and intelligent services, you would think that someone, somewhere would be able to learn what I enjoy reading and recommend me more like it. I would rather not live in an echo chamber, but I want to avoid having to put in as much work as I do to find enjoyable articles. This is precisely the type of useful application new technology should have instead of manipulating people on social media, can’t it just find me things to read… please.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The idea of Stoptober is, at least in the UK, to stop drinking or smoking. It’s used as a marketing gimmick by so many companies that have a vested interest in selling you things, but the premise is great.</p>
<p>Considering myself and my wife don’t smoke, nor drink very much, we have decided to instead stop our negative thoughts. After both suffering with our <a href="/2022/07/27/210805.html">mental health</a> for a few months, it is the ideal opportunity to try to get back to feeling like ourselves again.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a2293632d8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>How on earth are we going to do this, you might ask. Well, we’ve chosen to meditate every day for a month. It’s a practice that’s dropped off in our lives recently and a good opportunity to introduce it to our son, who’s also joining us on this journey.</p>
<p>Day one is already completed after a nightmare setting up our family plan to <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a> to include my son&rsquo;s Android phone. Hopefully, this might be the kick up the backside we both need and improve our thought patterns and concentration.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Russell Brandom for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/22/23365781/tiktok-youtube-bootleg-ratio-social-platforms-original-content">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I call it the Bootleg Ratio: the delicate balance between A) content created by users specifically for the platform and B) semi-anonymous clout-chasing accounts drafting off the audience. Any platform will have both, but as B starts to overtake A, users will have less and less reason to visit and creators will have less and less reason to post. In short, it’s a sign that the interesting stuff about the platform is starting to die out.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a fascinating point and one that is further expanded to partially explain the inability of Vine to cash in on its network. There&rsquo;s a slow change in the way people relate to their social network of choice, they all start out small and lovely places to be, but once they get to a tipping point it&rsquo;s all downhill. What was once a space for sharing becomes yet another avenue to distribute on, and becomes less and less unique.</p>
<p>Instagram has gone through several cycles of this and seems to be on its way down again, whereas it hasn’t really stuck on Twitter. As Russel points out, “What’s left is often depressing and unpleasant, but it’s uniquely Twitter” — and if that isn’t a perfect description, I don’t know what is.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It was only fairly recently I came to the realisation that I was chronically lonely. Granted, there are a few of you out there that I do consider friends that I have met online, but I’ve never had many real life friends. Those that I organically picked up through school or college now have lives of their own and drifted away.</p>
<p>As a defence mechanism for more than a decade I convinced myself I didn’t need people anyway. Built a persona of some kind of tough guy loner and even convinced myself for a bit. I had a sales job where I spoke to loads of people daily, but it was all an act to fill a role that I enjoyed quite a bit. It allowed me to be the person that I used to be in school and forget myself for a while.</p>
<p>Today is my birthday, and I’ve spent it alone with my dog. Exercising, reading and waiting for my family to finish school and work. Today has been a bit like bunking off school, you get the day off but everyone else is doing other things anyway, so you just hang around. I honestly have nothing to do and no one to see, and that’s a tiny bit sad to say out loud.</p>
<p>There’s no cry for help here, but more of a public display that it’s OK to be lonely. Especially as a man, it’s really difficult to express those feelings. You don’t have to hide it away, it’s OK to need and want other people around you. As great as my dog is, he’s not enough to make me feel good on my birthday, and that’s ok for me to feel. I am thankful for the few messages that I have received and realise that I am still an amazingly lucky guy to be where I am.</p>
<p>I’m just lonely, and an introvert. Is that even possible?</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The importance of having something that you can fully focus on and forget the world for a bit is becoming more and more obvious to me. Perhaps it is because the world sucks and the moment, and there is always some kind of bad news just around the corner. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just that I am <a href="/2022/07/30/placebo.html">struggling</a> more than I ever thought possible, but I just need to switch off for a while and <a href="/2022/07/27/210805.html">not feel bad about it</a>.</p>
<p>Some people find this in computer games, some find it in reading, but mine is writing and tinkering with my blog. I can only truly escape from the world for a bit whilst typing away on my keyboard doing my thing, and I only figured this out because I haven’t been doing it so much lately. Between <a href="/2022/09/09/caught-again.html">COVID</a>, work and just feeling burnt out when I get home, my personal projects have been on the back burner more than normal.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I have still been publishing quite a bit lately, but this has been from my phone. An experience that I quite enjoy as it allows me to publish on the go and be a bit more personal about things that are happening currently, but doesn’t quite give the same escape. Whilst using my laptop, I tend to let my mind wander a bit and don’t end up scrolling <a href="/2022/07/31/of-course-i.html">social media so much</a>. I might start writing a post, and then tidy up the code on my blog, then perhaps edit some image sin Lightroom to publish. Just flit around doing random things I enjoy and not have to worry about anything else.</p>
<p>There’s no solution here, at least not one that I have worked out yet, but I wonder what random escapes others have. Something that seems so mundane or perhaps that others would hate gives me so much joy, so I bet we’ve all got some weird things we need to do to get through life.</p>

      <p>Starting this post took longer to work out than almost any post I have written. Where do you start when the subject you want to talk about is so devastating, but still important to think about. I guess fair warning, this post could upset some people as it discusses children passing away.</p>
<p>I can’t even imagine the feelings that our friends feel every year their little boy&rsquo;s birthday comes around. They have suffered the worst thing to happen to any parent and had two of their children pass away. Both suffering from a genetic heart condition that was undiscovered until their second boy died soon after birth.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9ac3024299.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>They are both amazing and a credit to their family with the way that they remember them both so publicly. Tonight we went to their home to celebrate what would have been his second birthday. Each year we remember him, as we did a few weeks ago with his brother, by releasing balloons. They each have little messages on from us all as a little token of our loss.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/508276df04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The event is not a somber affair, but more of a celebration and a thank you for being in our lives. It’s hard to put into words how much we miss them both, and by releasing balloons it allows us to pause and think of him as they float away. A quiet and apt event which we all stand and watch with our friends. Whereas I would want to bury myself away and not be around people, they have an entirely different way of dealing with the grief and one that helps us all.</p>

<p>I always end up leaving their home with a renewed outlook on life. If they can deal with something so devastating, then the framing that we all put on our troubles seems insignificant. By celebrating their children each year, so publicly, they are helping others in more ways than they realise.</p>
<p>They have set up a charity in their boys names and are also helping more families to discover this genetic condition, so they can receive the help they need. I feel lucky to know them and find them both amazingly inspiring.</p>

      <p>Seth Godin writing about <a href="https://seths.blog/2022/09/its-just-not-that-good/">things being good</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not that good for who? If you mean to say, “I don’t like it, it doesn’t appeal to me,” then that’s what you should say.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you have enough expertise and domain knowledge to say, “I understand what has appealed to the audience you’re trying to serve, and this isn’t going to work.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Weird that this post should come up when I am consuming more tech reviews than I think I have ever done. Of course, the vast number of reviews come away with no conclusion and tell you everything is great, but a good number of them draw conclusions based on their very limited and niche usage.</p>
<p>The decision on a product or service is good or bad is based on your experience. Some reviewers can think about how more general users would feel about things, but many do not. They extrapolate from their opinion, which is often clouded with other factors, and draw conclusions based solely on themselves. Using this to influence purchases from other people.</p>

      <p>When I was younger, I had to go with my grandad to church. He was, what I used to think of as a hardcore Christian, that was until I had been exposed to Americans. He never missed a service, and I hated going.</p>
<p>All the excuses I could think of were saved up for the weekend to try to get out of it. I honestly despised going with every fiber of my being. I was young, and you’re supposed to hate things like this, and it didn’t help that every second of it was terrible. The place was cold, the people were weird, and I had much better things to be doing with my time on a Sunday morning. Yet now I would give anything to go with him.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/964da2f363.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>He passed away some years ago now, and I look back on even the times I would rather not be there as some of the best times of my life. You see, there will always be a last time you have to do something you dislike — but when it&rsquo;s gone you will miss it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sat up at <a href="/2022/08/30/the-world-is.html">night for hours and hours</a> with my daughter Lucie. Through whole nights just holding her because she needed me close to settle. There have been times that my son requires something doing and all I want to do is sit down for a bit. I will always do them though, with a smile on my face, because there will be a time when they won’t need me any more, and I’ll miss them.</p>
<p>You never get the time back, even the times you hate. However, from experience I know how badly you will want to live that experience again should the worst happen. Even the times you hate is precious, appreciate it.</p>

      <p>I guess one of the things you realise when you have kids, or you&rsquo;re around a lot of them, is that they all have weird obsessions. You expect the usual superheroes, or horses or fire engines, but my daughter is obsessed with shoes!</p>
<p>She just loves them, and I have no idea where it has come from. Granted, she is <a href="/2020/01/31/the-diagnosis-relief.html">disabled</a>, but since she could crawl around, she always had a shoe nearby. Where most kids need teddies or blankets to settle down, Lucie has an emotional support shoe (it&rsquo;s brand new). My Adidas Samba has even been down to an operation with her.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ab71d1e449.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Our house is just littered with shoes for her to play with, or just carry around, as well as the usual musical or flashing toys. Perhaps it is because she spent much of her life on the floor due to mobility issues, but at this point I am just speculating.</p>
<p>If you ever visit our house, she will chase you around until she decides your shoes are not nice enough, or you take them off so she can have a proper look.</p>
<p>It causes some weird looks from people that don&rsquo;t know her, but that&rsquo;s just Lucie — and she loves shoes.</p>

      <p>Since moving to a <a href="/2021/11/05/a-new-home.html">new domain</a> and trying to put all the things I create together online, I&rsquo;ve been feeling a bit of pressure. Granted, completely self-imposed, but a very real tinge of anxiety to be better at what I publish there. A noble pursuit but one that’s made me feel down.</p>
<p>Before I discuss these worries, let&rsquo;s take a step back a bit and be honest. I&rsquo;m playing pretend. In a world of writers, photographers and all around publishing masters — I&rsquo;m not even small fry and the framing of this is important when discussing these types of worries. Simply because I shouldn&rsquo;t have them at all.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a0cf84bb2c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Publishing my thoughts to the internet was easy when I didn&rsquo;t care. My domain wasn&rsquo;t my name, and I wasn&rsquo;t even pretending to build some kind of online presence. I’ve been putting things online for a little short of a decade and never worried once about what it looked like. Something worth remembering because my blog in no small part is one of the reasons I have my day job. Yet now, I have some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yips">blogging yips</a> because nothing is good enough to be published.</p>
<p>There are no shortage of ideas on what to write about, but they rarely make it past a draft. To cure it, I’ve had to <a href="/2022/09/16/why-gr-has.html">strip everything back</a> and make my writing more personal. Go back to my blogging roots and make my website about me again. I may be boring, I may make ridiculous typos, but it’s the only way for me to seemingly publish more often.</p>
<p>I am positive others feel this way because they compare themselves to others. It’s the way of the modern world online, comparing <a href="/2021/05/31/insides-vs-outsides.html">your insides to everyone else’s outsides</a> and we all know it. Sometimes you have to get out your own way and just do it.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There is no getting away from my love of photography and cameras. My favourite thing in the world is going somewhere, anywhere, and just wondering around pointing my lens at things. The simple act of doing so is like mediation to me, and nothing thing else comes close.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I shoot loads, sometimes I don&rsquo;t. Occasionally, I get things I am happy with, more often they <a href="/2021/08/04/other-peoples-trash.html">all go in the bin</a>. I love having my camera in my hand, and each year when new iPhone day comes around, I seemingly forget no phone can replace it.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/58a79e02e9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The process of taking photos has nothing to do with the camera I have. The iPhone camera that’s in my pocket is more than capable of capturing most of the street photography I do. The reason a camera matters so much to me is that it is <em>just</em> a camera. Nothing more, no internet, no restrictions. I am alone with the world.</p>
<p>I do take loads of photos with my phone too. No doubt once I <a href="/2022/09/18/schrdingers-iphone.html">get over myself,</a> I will enjoy using the iPhone 14 Pro huge new sensor. In fact, it’s the only reason I bought it. I couldn’t care less about dynamic islands and always on displays. As soon as Apple began talking about the new 48mp sensor, my brain was already thinking about what I could do with it. It’s just not a camera.</p>
<p>Let’s take nothing away from mobile photography. In no way do you <a href="https://www.thedent.net/2018/10/14/224500.html">need a camera</a> to be a photographer, people get spectacular shots using smartphones. That is simply not me. As strange as this sounds, <a href="/2021/07/29/having-a-camera.html">having and using a camera</a> has become part of my identity as an individual. I carry my x100v with me anywhere, and <a href="https://social.lol/@gr36/108966608695072912">despite my initial thoughts,</a> I don&rsquo;t think that will stop. I’ve never really enjoyed using a phone to take anything more than snapshots but I think now might be the time to at least try.</p>

      <p>Damon Beres writing for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/iphone-14-apple-annual-upgrade-improvements/671380/">The Atlantic</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a market generally defined by boring hunks of plastic, Apple gained an edge through impeccable design that was actually less functional than most of the competition.</p></blockquote>
<p>The iPhone got its foot hood in the market because it <em>was</em> Apple. They designed and presented it in a way that was theirs, and no one else could come close to the pull they had. It wasn’t the best, didn’t have all the features that everyone else did, but it was exciting and new.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The iPhone 14, meanwhile, with a suite of incremental and frankly boring improvements, is the iPhone that will change nothing.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a bit steep to say nothing, but it doesn’t change much. The rate of change is so small now that new releases are boiled down to a few words. Even the marketing is clutching at straws and the presentations are filled with things that the old model could do, or can now do with the software update launched with the new phone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where the iPhone once symbolised verve, it now evokes crushing inevitability. The company will produce, the people will consume, and the waste will pile up (and up and up).</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple doesn&rsquo;t even need to try to sell phones. Users buy the version newer than the one they have and continue to do so. Complacency is nothing to fear when your market is this dominant and if you sell a few less, you spent less in developing it, so what does it matter.</p>

      <p>Each year, when the new iPhone is released, I feel the same emotions that I experienced the year before. The iPhone takes up a weird position in my life where I both want it and don&rsquo;t want it at the same time. Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t open a box and remove the device from its unknown position.</p>
<p>I first observed this <a href="/2020/11/21/the-iphone-line.html">with the iPhone 12</a>, but the new iPhone 14 pro has taken this to a whole new level. The shiny new device that landed at my house on Friday is beautiful and really nice to use, but also ultimately pointless and offers me very little exchange for the outlay. This is the problem, it’s so impressive and shiny and new that I want to pick it up and use it, but also don’t want to use my phone all the time. I don’t have anything <a href="/2022/09/06/the-internet-is.html"> to do on it anyway</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/800a58b184.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I am not motivated nor excited by gadgets any more. Perhaps because I am getting old, or perhaps <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/iphone-14-apple-annual-upgrade-improvements/671380/">iPhones are getting boring now</a>. My phone is a tool, a tool I try to use as little as possible, but have accepted that it must exist in my life. The iPhone 14 pro is so good at its job that I can rely on it to do more things than ever before. I can read, and write, and take outstanding photos. I can also doom scroll social media and miss the world around me.</p>
<p>I realise all of this is no fault of Apple or the iPhone, <a href="/2020/09/09/itxs-not-the.html">it’s me</a>. I want to put these barriers in place so that I enjoy my life more, yet I miss the times that iPhone delivery day was one of the best times of the year. The new iPhone didn’t cost me much due to selling my old one, and there was only one version to choose from. Now my comparison is against the £1200 I spent buying my shiny new toy and the value it gives me back.</p>
<p>As for right now, I’m typing this out on my iPhone 13 mini. Trying to express my feelings as if writing in a journal to myself. Can I afford the new iPhone, sure. Do I really want to spend this money, not really. This one does just fine, and probably will for a while. It’s just the desire for the shiny new things I can’t switch off. That&rsquo;s what marketing does to you, I guess.</p>

      <p>My life online is often complex and filled with preaching advice that I don’t take. More often than not, that involves my use of an app or blogging platform. If you’re new around here I go backwards and forwards in just about everything and most the of words coming further down the page I have said before but still don’t really believe. My blogging habits suck.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, I have wanted to be a writer. About technology mainly. There are two pretty big reasons standing in the way of though. One is that I’m not any good at it. Two, I can’t be bothered to put in the effort to become good at it, despite the number of blog posts I have written telling myself I am going to.</p>
<p>At various points in my life, I convince myself that I am going to knuckle down and get on with it. Or build a more professional blog, or just burn it all down and publish what I like. Of course, I believe all of these things, at the time. I’m well aware of what I should be doing, and messing around like I do is not that.</p>
<p>Anyway, those more observant of you might have noticed that I am publishing on my ‘old’ domain again. The reasons for this are related to a lack of motivation rather than a brilliant idea. Publishing more personal posts and returning to more of a microblog intention is where my current motivation is, and I really couldn’t be bothered to move things properly. The friction is <a href="/2022/08/26/the-quiet-and.html">deciding where the different types of posts</a> I was writing began to get too much.</p>
<p>All of my old blog posts can still be found on gregmorris.co.uk, but I won’t be publishing anything new there going forward. Not because I’ve given up, I just couldn’t find an easy way to do what I wanted with the permalinks and RSS feed. To be frank, I could have sorted it out, but the work I would have put in vs the return from actually blogging just didn’t make sense.</p>
<p>So, everything is here, and also there. Get it. Good. Carry on.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Over the last few weeks, I have come to realise how much time that I spend waiting for people. Islam sat in my car, just chilling and waiting for something to finish.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8b14a0a391.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is usually my view. Waiting for my son to finish school and walk to meet me. I’m not cool enough to be able to actually go to his school any more, so I have to sit in the car and wait. Which I guess could be viewed as wasted time.</p>
<p>Thankfully it gives me time to catch up on my reading queue, or listen to a podcast or write a quick post (like this one). I used to spend much longer time on my own, but driving all over the country, so I guess in the grand scheme of things it’s a net win.</p>
<p>I love to people watch too. Just take in what else is going on in the world. I just wish my waiting places were a bit more interesting. Does anyone else live there life like this? I don’t mind it, really.</p>

      <p>Day two of <a href="/2022/09/09/caught-again.html">being positive</a>, and it has been a lonely one. In other circumstances my day might have been considered perfect, filled with crap TV, books and chilling out. I don’t feel ill per se (bar a headache and a bit of a cough) but I am completely drained of energy.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/15ded37443.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Despite my family checking on me and making sure I am OK, it’s not the same as hanging out together. This is what I miss the most. Keeping myself away from the others is the right thing to do, but it feels really isolating and not what I am used to. I look forward to our weekends together and even if we don’t do much, enjoy time just hanging out.</p>
<p>I am having to do things in burst due to feeling worn out, just sitting up and typing this out is bound to leave me feeling tired again. However, there isn’t much sleeping going on due to my dreams being disturbed and a bit hallucinogenic. When I wake up, I feel as if I have been out running, not laying in my bed.</p>
<p>COVID is such fun. It isn’t like any other illness I have had before and despite having three vaccinations, and catching it symptom free last year I can still feel this ill is weird.</p>

      <p>On Wednesday afternoon, I started to feel a bit under the weather. Nothing major, just a bit of a sore throat and lacking energy, but I’d already been for a run that morning, followed by loads of meetings, so I figured I just needed some rest. After taking some tablets, I headed to bed for one of the worst night of sleep I have ever had, and that’s where the fun began.</p>
<p>Tossing and turning, periods of hot sweats and feeling unbelievably cold gave way to a massive headache and no energy. I knew this feeling from earlier in the year though, so I did the sensible thing and did a COVID test, which came back negative. The giant headache I had was like nothing I had experienced before, making me feel sick and unable to do anything.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/97f7965ea6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Thankfully, this morning I felt a bit better and managed to shake off the bad head thanks to loads of painkillers. I thought it was all behind me until the cough caught up with me, and at that point I decided to test again and the dreaded red line appeared!</p>
<p>Could be placebo, or could be that I am heading down hill, but the cough is worse, and my energy levels have dropped to zero. However, I am feeling OK in myself. The worst part by far is having to stay away from my family. I’m semi distanced upstairs, and I miss them tremendously. Lucie didn’t understand why she couldn’t have a cuddle after school, but I couldn’t bare her getting poorly.</p>
<p>Could be much worse, I suppose.</p>

      <p>For what seems like forever, I have been trying to cut down my usage of Twitter. Going around and around in circles with tactics to reduce the time <a href="/2022/08/02/writing-instead-of.html">spent scrolling</a> and place it somewhere else. I know the service is bad for me, for issues that are <a href="/2020/09/09/itxs-not-the.html">my own, not the services</a>, but after years of usage I just can’t stay away.</p>
<p>It drags me down rabbit holes that I use to avoid doing other things, and ultimately make myself feel worse about the world and affecting my mental health. I know this, yet still do it, so I’ve taken some drastic action to avoid even logging in. On Sunday, I changed my password to one that I do not know, and then <a href="/2022/09/03/ive-had-to.html">deactivated my account</a>. I now have no choice but to have a little break away from using Twitter, with the surprising realisation that the internet is actually pretty boring!</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/851409a86b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Granted, I don’t stray into much of the web, but it no longer provides the entertainment relief it used to, and I’m fine with that. The itch to reach for my phone is slowly going due to the fact I open up a couple of other apps, realise nothing is happening and then close them again.</p>
<p>I guess I’ll carry on reading or writing instead of scrolling, as well as lifting my outlook on the world. I’d like some more group chats in my life though to fill my <a href="/2022/08/30/social-media-interaction.html">slightly isolated feeling</a>.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Today is one of the scary times as a parent, the first day at big school for my son. He’s 11, so he’s off to secondary school, and at this point in life it’s a hug shift to go through. Thankfully he’s coping with it really well, and despite some nerves he’s really looking forward to new experiences.</p>
<p>On our way to school, he was asking me about my first day at school, and to be honest, I don’t even remember it. Not because it was more than 25 years ago (yes I am that old) but because not much of my school life seems to have stuck in my head. I guess that’s the thing with the events, they seem huge at the time, but depending <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/01/06/it-depends-on.html">on when you write the novel that is your life</a>, depends on how much space it takes up.</p>
<p>All I remember are fleeting little memories that really stuck out, but the nerves and terrible feeling that no doubt happened on my first day are lost to time. We spent a few minutes talking about that, and he realised he couldn’t even remember his first day back last year, so that gave him confidence.</p>
<p>I am so proud of him. Not because of what he achieves or the things he does, but because of the person he has become. <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/james-morris/">James</a> is such a nice person to be around and that gives me confidence with the way we have worked as a family. We will only get this experience once, as Lucie stays at the same school until she is 19, so we might as well try to enjoy it today.</p>

      <p>At the same point each year, my wife and I get into the same discussion. It’s a few weeks until my birthday, and she wants to buy me presents. So, we have the same circular conversation that I don’t want nor need anything, and she tries all sorts of tactics to get me to give in.</p>
<p>My wife shares a viewpoint with most of the world, in that the volume of stuff or expenditure is equal to the amount you care about someone. She thinks that if I don’t receive anything, then I will be disappointed, and no amount of reassurance seems to matter.</p>
<p>I will concede that some of my issues with my birthday are deep-rooted phycological weirdness. For example, I do not believe birthdays are anything special and seem like a celebration for nothing. You are not achieving anything by being on a rock that has gone around the sun any more. No, I don’t know what my parents did to me as a child!</p>
<p>However, I hate stuff, and cluttering up my life with things I do not really need and have just thought up to make someone happy is a nightmare. So, I will have the conversation year-on-year, forever…</p>

      <p>I know at some point in my life I am going to have to let you go. I pray that is not for a very long time. There were years before you arrived, but I don’t remember them clearly. When you were born, it was as if I were born again and have lived another, better life with you. I know you were given to me to teach me about the world, and I promised to show you it.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7ec25892e9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When we sat up at nights, we talked. You never said anything back to me, but you spoke to me for all those hours. When most people would be yearning for their bed, I needed you in my arms as much as you needed me close to you. To hold and protect you. For you to teach me about myself.</p>
<p>There will be a time when these moments will go, and I will die a little. You have made me who I am today, my special little girl. I am your legs, your body, and your words, and I will not fail you. You are my eyes now, for I see the world with you for as long as it will let us be together. The world is far too big for you at the moment, but that won&rsquo;t be the case forever…just not yet.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When typing out my thoughts and going well past a short tweet, I thought for longer than I should have about the title of this post. I like to give them a snappy title that sums everything up. The most logical word to use for this would be engagement, but like productivity, that word is ruined now.</p><p>It shouldn’t be. It is the reason I use social media and the driving motivation to stick around on Twitter when logically I should leave it behind. Talking to people and engaging with others <em>is</em> the point, after all, social media without the social part is pretty pointless. Yet, we all base its importance on numbers and stats that mean nothing.</p><p>I must admit that I still don’t really ‘get’ social media. I’ve never been able to crack that part of my marketing brain and really push on to succeed in that world. Mainly because all the ‘engagement’ stats that people measure against mean nothing to me. Likes, hearts, clicks, all that kind of stuff just don’t matter to me. The people behind them do, and it’s so sad that all the importance of social media seems to be dying apart from these things.</p><p>My followers have fluctuated between 1,900 and 2,500 for years. Loads of bots pump it up for a bit, and then Twitter sorts it out and deletes loads of them. I’m not a popular figure in the slightest, but the replies that I get are from a cross-section of roughly 30 people. A small sliver of the people who are supposedly following me and interested in what I have to say. Again, at risk of sounding ungrateful, this number means nothing to me, but the people do, so where are they?</p><p>Why has Twitter died so much, to a point that interactions are few and far between? Since the whole Elon thing, it seems as if once great Twitter users can’t be bothered any more. Myself included. Much like the job market struggles, perhaps the pandemic has made people realise that all this superficial stuff doesn’t matter any more and their time is worth more. I can only speculate, but many of the <em>real</em> people seem to have gone.</p><p>The enjoyment I take from tweeting seems to becoming less and less. I thought for a long time this was me, I wasn’t engaging enough and no one was interested in this old dude any more. As time has gone on, I realised the reason I tweeted less and less was because others were tweeting less and finding similar struggles.</p><p>At least that what I am telling myself, or maybe I am just old and don’t get it any more.</p>

      <p>My motivation to do, well, anything, comes in waves. At some points, <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/07/27/210805.html">particularly lately</a>, I can’t be bothered to write, run or do the things that I know I should do. However, I also know that these are the days that will make the most difference to me. I will improve the most struggling through the hard days and make sure the easy days feel much better.</p>
<p>I <em>know</em> these things, but that doesn’t mean I can always drag myself towards <em>doing</em> these things. Every so often I just can’t be bothered to do anything, I don’t feel the need to hack every waking moment of my life and maximise everything. Occasionally, I just want to let the motivation slip away and smash it again another day.</p>
<p>It sucks, being on Struggle Street, but I am happy in the knowledge that it always gets better. There is always and end to the empty feelings and lack of motivation when the colour returns to the world. So keep going, my friends, and I’ll see you at the end.</p>

<p>Bigger phones are popular mostly because they are a computer replacement for a lot of people.

</blockquote>
<p>Lee gets it spot on here, for a lot of people there only device is a smartphone and it makes perfect sense to have the biggest and best you can use. However there are a lot of people, myself and Lee included, that just want a device that gets out the way.</p>
<p>For a long time I have thought the perfect screen size was around 5", or a device around the size and weight of the iPhone 7. However people like myself have to accept that the world wants bigger whereas I’d rather <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/12/08/putting-in-some.html">put some barriers in the way</a> to my screen time.</p>

      <p>As with everything tech related, when I start to see similar thoughts and ideas shared online, I am never sure what the motivation is. Could it be that several people have come to a shared conclusion at the same point, or are marketing departments gearing up for something? Of course, it’s building up to that time of year when we all talk about iPads.</p><p>The simple answer when debating the authenticity of anything is to consult independent publishing, aka read personal blogs. So, when Robert Rackley posted <a href="https://frostedechoes.net/minimal-mac/">Minimal Mac</a>, I knew that for one reason or another the strange feelings that I currently have around my MacBook are shared.</p><blockquote>Multitasking is bullshit. I can’t help but roll my eyes whenever someone comes with a fancy talk around the necessity of having multiple displays or app windows opened at the same time and all the time. — <a href="https://frostedechoes.net/minimal-mac/">Minimal Mac</a></blockquote><p>For many weeks, I has already decided that <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/08/19/getting-away.html">during my week away</a> at the beach, I wanted to avoid taking my laptop. I’d be taking loads of photos and would no doubt do some publishing, but I wanted all trace of work put away for a few days. The answer, of course, was to take my <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/08/18/all-work-and.html">creative computer</a> aka my iPad Pro. I don’t <a href="https://gr36.com/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html">work on it</a> any more, and it has been a long time since I even used one properly, so the timing is perfect.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/07f6c1814b.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>So, I snapped on a magic keyboard, and took the most laptop like iPad away with me and used it exclusively for a week. Well, I used it a bit, this was a holiday after all. There are still some frustrations, none of which will be fixed by the upcoming iOS16 introduction of new app windowing. Infact nothing has really changed from the iPad that I left behind three years ago, but I think my expectation <em>have</em> changed.</p><p>As I type out this post back at home on my Mac, I realise how much calmer iOS is when you expect nothing of it. I wasn’t looking for a do it all machine, I was looking for it to do a few simple tasks, and do them well. There’s just something so brilliant about using one app at a time and nothing else. No more trying to fit a round peg in a square hole and expecting the iPad to be a desktop computer. Much more than this, the iPad delivered a small space of calm and straightforward usage — just like it always has.</p><p>Perhaps Apple is trying to deliver what its users want and are working hard to deliver the next generation of device. Or perhaps there is just more expectation from an iPad with an M1 chip that costs almost £1000. Whatever the reason is that the iPad Pro seems to never deliver what is expected of it, when you want calm and easy to use, iOS is where you find it.</p>

      <p>For the last few weeks, I have been struggling with what to do with the posts I want to publish. With my <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/08/24/back-in-the.html">renewed motivation</a> to do a bit more, and also publish <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/">more photos,</a> the sensible thing is to sort this out now. As it stands currently I have <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/">a blog</a> and a <a href="https://gr36.com">micro.blog</a>, and the lines are getting blurry.</p><p>I have long ago given up the idea that my writing will be popular or even widely read, but I love having a nice blog just for me to publish my thoughts and feelings. If one person reads it, then that’s a bonus. If they take something away from it, apart from knowledge not to visit again, then perfect. I love publishing anything that comes to mind, and in that sense, just having one blog makes perfect sense.</p><p>I have <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/03/28/why-microblog.html">been here before</a>, when I just wanted a place to type something out and hit publish. Despite my insistence that things have changed, I moved back to Ghost soon after and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-new-home/">made a new home</a>. So, I have more than a bit of trepidation on going all in on one blog yet again, given that neither of the places do a good job of fulfilling both of these post types.</p><p>Ghost really doesn’t work well with posts having no title and no support of any open web standards. Whereas my micro.blog is nearly always breaking, or not doing something quite right. Something I'm not really concerned about with smaller posts, but I like to publish something if I have half a mind to do so.</p><p>If it was possible to move my Ghost posts over, I would have a test on how micro.blog would look, but that doesn’t work either. I will probably mess around with two spaces for a lot longer, until I lose the motivation to think about it any longer.</p>

      <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781800812239">Building a Second Brain</a> by Tiago Forte 📚</p>
<p>It falls down the usual trope of telling you want they do and why you should, then giving you loads of cherry picked examples to prove their point.</p>
<p>There is a good system in there so it’s worth a read but you can get the point by just skimming or reading a few of his blog posts.</p>

<p>Creativity is a habit. - <a href="https://dazne.net/work/">Do the Work</a>, Danze</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve fallen into a bit of a rabbit hole with <a href="https://dazne.net">Rishabh Dassani</a> as it seems each of their posts speaks to me on some level or another. Giving me little bits of advice in productivity, organisation and life.</p>
<p>Some of the points outlined in Do the work have reminded me of things I have discovered myself and then let slip. I need to start <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/sitting-in-the/">sitting in the chair</a> again and making my creativity a habit. My inspiration and <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/07/27/the-good-news.html">motivation to publish</a> come in waves but only when I put the work in do I really make strides in publishing my thoughts and clearing my mind.</p>
<p>I write because I enjoy the <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/08/25/writing-consistently.html">process of writing</a> and hitting publish is just a nice outcome.</p>

      <p>Today was very much beach day. Not because the weather was great (it was OK but not great), but simply because we would rather not do anything. We don’t have the luxury of being somewhere exotic so we have to make do with the English beaches. We sat in the waves for a few hours and enjoyed ourselves none the less.</p>

<p>Lucie has a love of the water and the ocean in particular, so she won&rsquo;t leave it until it&rsquo;s home time!</p>

<p>I even had a swim out to sea with my son, no-one wants to see photos of that!</p>

<p>I guess this makes sense really, not just online but in our lives. We are constantly moulding ourselves to be ‘better’ but not always better in the grand scheme of things. Better for something or usually someone.</p>

      <p>I woke up this morning with a need to take some photos. No idea why, but it wouldn’t go away so I took my x100v when I walked the dog.</p>

<p>Found a nice little church tucked out the way</p>

<p>And took some public footpaths back</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/daf43d08c2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>However it just didn’t cut it, so I took my XT3 and walked around for an hour or so in the early sunshine.</p>

<p>What could have been a terrible sleep deprived morning turned into one of the most awe inspiring experiences I have had for a while.</p>

<p>There was just myself, my wife and Lucie on the sea front, with nothing to hear but the calm waves.</p>

      <p>Around this time last year, I gave up my work iMac Pro and began working on my personal MacBook Pro. In many ways, this was the best decision I have ever made because I can take my computer wherever I am in the office and also plug it into a monitor when I am working at home. Yet, my work and my creative life have never felt the same since.</p><p>I <a href="/2021/06/23/force-some-ipad.html">spoke at the time</a> of the deep cross-overs that these two areas of my life were having. Pondering over the use of an iPad for my personal life to introduce a bit of calm. This experiment didn’t last very long due to various factors including the iPad no longer working, but the idea is sound and given my <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/07/27/210805.html">recent struggles</a> is something I want to explore again.</p><p>What really tipped me over the edge towards iOS adoption again was a couple of excellent posts by Josh Ginter. Since March, he has been keeping a <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2022/03/28/keeping-a-separate-creativity-computer/">separate creativity computer</a> (an iPad Pro) due to being in a similar situation as myself. I hadn’t quite realised that the feelings he felt were the same ones swirling in my head until reading this. Indeed, he has become a proponent of a <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2022/06/17/keeping-a-separate-well-everything/">separate creative everything</a>, to build walls between personal and professional.</p><p>It makes perfect sense and drawing parallels in my photography life, I simply have to keep a separate ‘work’ and <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/06/01/keep-it-simple.html">family camera</a>. So with my work kindly supplying a new iPad for me to use, the experiment is on once again. I am hoping that the calmness and tendency for me to use one app at a time will give me some creative spark and allow me to <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/11/10/going-deeper.html">work a bit deeper</a> on the tings I enjoy.</p>

      <p>I didn’t, as I suspected, renew my Glass subscription just <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/08/for-the-sake.html">for the sake of it</a> I cancelled and deleted my account. Nothing personal and I know people around here love it, but the cost was not worth it.</p>
<p>I still can’t really figure out why but this description from Marc does a good job of summing some feelings up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Glass seemed to be somewhat of a monoculture. This makes sense: everyone in the app is rich enough to own an iPhone, probably also owns an expensive dedicated camera, a laptop (probably a MacBook) capable of editing them, and has enough discretionary income to pay a monthly subscription to a social media platform. This is boring.&rdquo; - <a href="https://imarc.co.uk/2021/09/01/glass-half-empty/">Marc Wickens</a></p></blockquote>
<p>There are entirely too many places to share <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/">photos</a> and micro.blog + a bit of Twitter suits me fine. Maybe even some <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/16/ive-konmarie-my.html">Instagram</a>, who knows.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When you are a child, you dream of huge, almost magical things happening in your life. The future is filled with so many, almost endless, possibilities that all those fantasies and aspirations don’t seem so hard to achieve. Yet for some reason all of that magic seems to fade as you get older, and you have to start being a bit more realistic, but it's really boring.</p><p>It’s a bit of a Meme now that all children want to be famous before they know what they would like to be famous for. There shouldn’t be much push back because this is understandable. These people are ones they look up to early in their life and as such the pinnacle of their world.</p><p>It’s easy to be dismissive of this. When children want to be YouTubers or play games for a living, it is just a modern-day version of what we all wanted to be when we were young. I always wanted to be a pilot because I lived in the flight path of some of the counties air defences and the sky was always filled with massive transport planes or high-speed fighter jets.</p><p>This love was nurtured by my grandfather, who would ask me what planes I wanted to fly and where I would want to go. Asking questions about how I thought I would become I pilot and what training I would need. He used my innocent desire to open my eyes up to the things I needed to think about, and that has stuck with me.</p><p>So now when my son <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/james-morris/">says to me, he wants to be a YouTuber</a>, my reaction is “cool, how do you think you could do that” instead of the realistic (pessimistic) answer of “that’s not going to happen”. Indeed, the ship to making money on YouTube has not sailed, but it is harder than ever to get started and the level of work required is huge. It's important that he starts to think about this, <strong>but</strong> there’s no need to be boring just yet.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Matt Birchler <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/migrating-from-wordpress/">is to blame</a> for some of the decisions I make in my tech and blogging life. Not because he does things differently, or tries to push his readers into things, but because he’s someone I look up too, and he speaks <em>mostly</em> a lot of sense. He’s been blogging for more than a decade (a milestone I won't pass until next year) and I am happy to say he is a good friend.</p><p>Matt has made a good name for himself in tech circles, and has done so by producing great content and plenty of it. His post from a few days ago about <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/absolutely-do-not-change-your-blogging-platform-unless-you-have-to/">not moving blogging platforms</a> is one of the reasons he’s been so successful. While I agree with his post wholeheartedly, there are a couple of things to dig into here to supplement it.</p><h2 id="permalinks">Permalinks</h2><p>The links to your posts should be treated like gold dust. They are the reason people read your stuff and find your blog in the first place. You should hold on to these as the most important piece of your blogging platform, and if you do, moving host will not matter in the slightest.</p><p>Your first job when setting up a blog <em>if</em> you make the hard choice to move platforms is to maintain the same structure as before or put a plan in place to redirect everything. With the first option being preferable. The links to your posts online are more valuable than what platform you use or how nice your posts look.</p><h2 id="let-down-by-providers">Let Down By Providers</h2><p>As I wrote in 2020, users <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/being-able-to-2/">should be able to move their blog</a> quickly and easily. Developers of these platforms are still letting down their users by not providing at least robust import options for all of their competition. This argument, granted, is idealistic and in many ways something that I never expect to see – but it still feels gross that barriers are in the way of you owning <em>your</em> content.</p><p>I can understand why companies put intentional barriers in the way to make moving more complicated, they want to keep your custom. However, the fact that platforms like <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> and <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> fall down at import options, is <strong>the</strong> reason you shouldn’t move about much. Not because your decisions are bad, not because your readers will care, but because you will waste too much time doing it for very little gain.</p><p><br />Of course, your readers <em>will</em> care if your permalinks break, or your RSS feed changes, but there are solutions for this. The biggest issue is that the time wasted moving and sorting issues out could be better spent blogging. Do that instead.</p>

      <p>One of the reasons I try not to write about my ways and opinions much any more is because of how peachy they can come across. When talking about anything, particularly something like technology usage, there’s a tendency to use instructional language that ends up being a post about little more than feeding the ego. My posts are never aimed like that, but I have read many that are, and whole books, that make me question my publication and motives.</p><p>Let’s take for example my repeated need every so often to <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/31/of-course-i.html">cut back my usage of Twitter</a>. This always leads to some kind of response coming back my way, either in direct reply but snarky subtweets. These kinds of responses <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/31/its-ok-to.html">do not bother me</a>, but they do reflect the way that social media tends to respond. I am told that the ‘personalness’ of social media leads to personal responses, but all we see are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-reply-guys">reply guys</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfE93xON8jk">Debbie Downers</a>.</p><p>People that take each interaction that is thrown into the ether as a slight on them and not merely a comment on the way that specific person feels. Using my Twitter example above, simply because I want to cut down my Twitter usage does not mean I am waving some kind of self-righteous flag and now looking down on people that continue to use it.</p><p>However, I get it. I’ve read the posts that <em>are</em> doing that. Lecturing you about the benefits of the thing they have done and imploring you to do the same. With all the ‘look how good I am’ ego pumping that their fingers can type. However, this is not the reason I publish things, it’s for me more than you. There is no preaching. Just a stream of consciousness and a written reference of my thoughts and feelings. Don’t take it personally.</p>

      <p>My <a href="https://glass.photo/gr36">Glass subscription</a> will be coming to an end in the upcoming weeks, and I don’t know what to do with it. Well, that’s a lie, I do, but I’m almost 90% sure I’ll end up paying another year just for the sake of fitting in.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong the app, and the website, is pretty, and I do think it is a good place for photographers to post. However, I only really post to it because it doesn’t really speak to me. I don’t feel a pull to post my photo there, and it wasn’t until posting more to micro.blog that I remembered to reinstall in on my new phone.</p>
<p>People I like post to it, the service keeps getting better and better, but I don’t get any real value from it. There are no more nice comments or sharing photo spots like there was when it started up. Appreciations are done well, but took away all the comments, and that really sucks. As much as I don’t want Glass to just be another social media channel, it doesn’t feel like a community and that is the biggest things stopping real engagement.</p>
<p>Couple with this my <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/02/trying-to-slim.html">recent tidying up of my expenses</a> and realisation of how much I could save a month by using different apps, means I am 90% of the way there. The cost isn’t extortionate but it all ads up!</p>
<p>I have a feeling I will end up just keeping it around or get FOMO at some point after I have cancelled.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>In my journey to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/putting-a-system-in-place/">improve my overall systems</a> of things and also <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/02/trying-to-slim.html">slim down on some expenditure</a> has taken a lot longer than expected. There could be many reasons for this, the number of services available, my persistent love of switching, or just my lack of motivation – however I needed to get notes right first, so this is where I started.</p><p>A <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/writing-instead-of-scrolling/">surprising amount of my time</a> is spent writing notes. They are used to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-i-use-2/">manage my life</a>, keep my writing ideas and also save anything that I find interesting and don’t want to try to remember. Because of their importance, I have tried to lean on service that I think show the importance of these notes. Services like <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/roam-research-as-my-second-brain/">Roam Research</a>, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-keep-coming/">Bear</a>, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-i-use-2/">Agenda</a>, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-obsidian-set/">Obsidian</a> and many more have come and gone. Costing me money and wasting time transferring things backwards and forwards.</p><p>As much as I want to be <em>that guy</em> and carry around a notebook and sketch things out. The reality is that I have to make all of these notes digital and searchable. Only one app has remained consistently used in all my time, Apple Notes. There could be many reasons it has remained despite repeated attempts to replace it. Perhaps the inbuilt nature means that it works with more things. Maybe it is simply because it is always there, but despite its shortcomings in a few areas, Apple Notes has proven the most robust and stable thing to use <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/using-ios-apple/">for years</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/81a3cc6f6c.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>Of course, this is a bit of a meme at the moment. Other people's reliance on Apple Notes proves to be constant with my experience and usage, but the internet never fails to make fun of things. I find this particularly hilarious because the journey from low IQ to high IQ is precisely what I have been feeling over the last few years. Despite using almost all the apps in this meme, I use Apple notes more than anything else, so it makes sense to just lean on this in my new system.</p><p>Don’t confuse this for a gushing review of all the things Apple Notes does better. There are flaws and plenty of them. Apple Notes doesn’t do everything I want it to. Apps like <a href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam Research</a> and <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> appeal to my brain much better than the rigid folder structure of Apple Notes. The linking between items and highlighting relationships features in all other options <em>but</em> Apple's option is more appealing. That is without the reality that Apps like Bear look and work infinitely better than my most used app.</p><p>Yet all the others fall down in others area in my systems, and the way I work means that the inbuilt abilities of Notes on my Mac and iPhone trumps nearly all.</p><h2 id="quick-notes">Quick Notes</h2><p>The backbone of most of my note-taking is <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/notes/apdf028f7034/mac">Quick Notes</a>, both the function in Apple Notes and the ability to take notes as quickly as possible. I realise that I am in a privileged position of using iPhone, Mac and iPad, but it doesn’t matter if I click in the bottom right on Mac. Or swipe in on iPad, or tap the icon in control centre — all the notes I take on the fly appear in the Quick Notes folder in Apple Notes.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/cbe100f182.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>I use this as an inbox for all the notes I take on the go. If I were to use the system outlined by Tiago Forte in <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com">Building A Second Brain</a>, this would be my Capture phase. Everything and anything gets saved as a quick note to be referred to or filed later. I am not crazy on the rigid folder structure of Apple notes. My brain doesn’t work as well in this hierarchy as it would when compared to a daily note approach used in Roam or Obsidian. However, having an inbox makes it easier for me to refer to things and then schedule in times to sort through them to action, file or delete the notes created.</p><h2 id="siri">Siri</h2><p>There’s a lot to be frustrated at Siri for, but it works quite well with the stock apps and means notes can be made on the go. This comes in particularly useful when driving, or out walking with AirPods in. The example below is a typical note I would make whilst walking, a book is mentioned in a podcast that sounds interesting, I make a note and act the note later when I have time.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/25e5d9ad65.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>Of course, I <em>could</em> try to remember all of these notes, and some people claim that systems like these make our brains soft. However, I have been making robust notes for a little over 3 years on everything I do, work, family, entertainment and much more. This has made me able to retain more information, improve my productivity and enjoy more time switched off.</p><h2 id="note-taking">Note-Taking</h2><p>It goes without saying that quick notes on the go are only one part of note-taking. There are far more notes containing large pieces of information, meeting notes and important things I need to save, potentially indefinitely. What I have come to realise when speaking to others in similar situations is that much of theirs are done on paper, if at all.</p><p>There is a certain level of expectation when watching interesting videos, reading non-fiction books, or just attending a meeting that the information you receive will just stick in your brain. This might just be me, but what I found out fairly early on at University is that taking notes and reading them back later, at least a couple of times, helps me be able to refer to them later on.</p><p>This can be by mentally recalling them fully and being able to quote some information, or simply being able to recall “I’m sure I have a note on that somewhere”. A typical one of my longer notes is shown below. Whilst listening to another podcast with Dave Brailsford, he highlighted some information about his CORE method of mentorship. I was able to make a quick note using Siri and then when I had more time I looked into it deeper and made longer notes.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/98acc9470f.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>The ability of Apple Notes to seamlessly switch between voice, written text and even handwritten notes, as with my CORE note, is outstanding and something that very few other services do as well. I am not one for dragging in images or links, but Apple Notes does this with ease too.</p><h1 id="file-reference">File &amp; Reference</h1><p>What’s the point of a note if you can’t find it later on? The information in notes needs to be searchable and easy to navigate. I have not adopted any more of Tiago Forte method of note-taking with storage, but instead adopted for easy to understand folders. Some <em>are</em> projects I am working on, but most are just an area of my life.</p><p>I have to say that most notes go in the bin after a small action, or become much longer ones after researching topics. So long-term storage is only those that I really do need. I found some people online talking about almost a decade's worth of notes in Evernote, and I shudder to think of the mess, but the most important thing is being able to search and find what you are looking for.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/ee0a89c66d.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>I could go deeper and use tags and a larger volume of folders; however, I have found there is much less metal stress of deciding where the notes go if there are fewer folders to choose from. Furthermore, I will only create a new folder if there is no suitable folder already.</p><p>Deciding what notes to keep is a hard choice, but with quick notes usually being actionable, it is important to me to be ruthless and only keep information for as long as it is useful. Apple Notes Search is on device, meaning that it is always fast and easy to find what I need. The powerful indexing also searched had written text with surprising accuracy, even with my terrible hand writing!</p><p>Having toyed with Readwise and all sorts of ways to import reading notes, that just never stick an inbuilt app just makes sense. Without doubt Apple Notes is <em>the</em> app I use the most. Now I have my system in place it is working even better for me and meaning I can write more posts and know where all my stuff is.</p>

      <p>A simple idea, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFvdHfhVIsQ">stollen from YouTuber Struthless</a> to replace what is ultimately bad for me, with something that is better. He replaced Social media with ‘micro-journalling’ to improve his mental health and found some exceptional benefits, so for the last couple of days I have replaced <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/31/of-course-i.html">my doom scrolling</a> with writing.</p><p>To succeed, let's face it a task like this <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/twitter-muscle-memory/">isn’t as easy as it seems</a>, I needed to make some modifications to the way my phone works. I am not actively avoiding Social Media (AKA Quitting) I am just limiting it. So, I had to make sure I wouldn’t open up Twitter without realising it, and pack my home screen full of the types of apps I wanted to use instead.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/f05a77c833.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p><a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-reading-flow/">Reading</a> and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-writing-workflow/">writing</a> in all its forms went right on my home screen to make sure they are in my face as much as possible. I am trying to make as much use of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205773">Apple Notes</a> as possible to capture anything and everything that comes to mind. Having already started to lean heavily on it as part of improving my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/putting-a-system-in-place/">overall systems,</a> the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/ipad/ipad5d91fd88/ipados">quick note function</a> coming to iPhone with iOS16 is a particular favourite new feature.</p><p>This didn’t work straight away, I had to delete all the social apps from my phone too, and also make sure I was signed out in Safari too. Now whenever I get the itch or find myself a bit bored instead of drifting away and scrolling social media, I write or read something instead. One often leads to the other and a few minutes down the line the feelings have, thankfully, gone.</p><p>There’s a habit of these types of posts to be preachy, but there is none of that here. This is simply what I am doing to better <em>my</em> day-to-day life. Again, this isn’t about avoiding social media, it is just me trying to be happier and at the same time write more – win-win.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I wrote a post <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/27/my-life-doesnt.html">a few days ago</a> about not being able to switch off and be focused. Well, that was the intention, but it came across in different ways to different people. I got lots of feedback from it, ranging from useful tips and interesting conversations to the usual “here’s my unsolicited advice”—all of which I’m grateful for.</p><p>However, I do want to clarify, I do know <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/going-deeper/">how to focus</a> and when I need to. The post was simply pointing out that we don’t all live in the luxury life where we can just turn everything off. If you work for yourself, there’s a tendency to forget, some of us (most of us) have an environment we need to be contactable in.</p><p>Unfortunately, countless businesses and management of those businesses expect things done certain ways and emails to be answered, etc. I am semi lucky that I don’t work for one of them, and I get plenty of time for deep work and creativity if I need it. Which, I doubt is the case for most people.</p><p>There’s a lot of research to suggest that the average time workers actually spend working in a day is a fraction of the period of time they are “at work”. Most experiencing <a href="https://clockify.me/blog/productivity/workplace-distractions/">56 distractions a day</a>, which is insane levels of outside noise to be expected to work in.</p><p>There is no luxury of turning off your email, or unplugging your phone in these places, and they are often starved of focused time to be able to do things properly. All the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/indistractable/">self-help books</a>, <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/a-world-without-email/">dreaming of a world without email</a> and productivity advice in the world won’t make a dent if the company culture doesn’t change.</p><p>Focused work is so important to each worker at all levels of employment. Yet, much like the weirdness we are seeing with working from home, there is a tendency to lean into “that’s just how we’ve always done it” and expect email to be answers straight away and phone calls to be taken. How many times have you sat in a meeting that should have been an email?</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It seems like an age ago I wrote about <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/love-stadia/">loving Stadia</a>. It has its issues, is always a few days away <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/google-insists-stadia-is-not-shutting-down">from being killed</a>, but it brought me back into gaming because of the ease of access. I had my iPad, adopted my son's Playstation controller, and I was away. Sure, I always think about building a gaming PC, but I probably never will, so enter the Steam Deck – level 2 of casual gaming.</p><p>To understand where this fits in and why the Steam Deck has made a difference to my gaming and life, the context is important. Despite playing numerous games at a young age, I stopped for so many years that I forget how many. I felt as if playing games was a waste of time, and I didn’t have many spare hours to spend gaming anyway.</p><p>Since playing on Stadia, I purchased an <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/instant-on/">Xbox One Series X</a> and despite it being a great device, playing in-front of a TV doesn’t suit my life all the time. It scratched my itch, but I didn’t have the time between everything else I had to do, a handheld device I can pick up and put down would be a much better fit. Thankfully, Vale’s hard to get Steam Deck provided cutting-edge gaming on the go.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/782d305619.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>Don’t expect this to be some kind of review, more of an overview of how much I have fallen in love with this device. Since picking on up from a friend of a friend for a reasonable price, I’ve been able to play great PC games on the go, as well as <a href="https://www.emudeck.com">install emulators</a> for an all-around experience.</p><p>I don’t use my Steam Deck for even half of what it can do. I don’t hack it or tweak it or do anything that ‘real gamers’ might do. However, I do play it to death, so much so I am worried about the longevity of the battery as I have to charge it up so often. A point that is exaggerated by the fact the battery is not the best, about 2 hours of gaming is all it can handle whilst playing anything graphically intense.</p><p>It isn’t all good news. If you’re a casual gamer like me, knowing what to play is a pain. The Steam library seems to talk in some know of second language and recommend games that I have to google to find out what the gameplay is like. So, YouTube is my best friend for the games I do buy, which is far too many of them.</p><p>All these words are to say that the Steam Deck is a great device. Not the best gaming set up in the world, but just what a casual gamer needs to be able to play more and enjoy a woder selection of games.</p>

      <p>I am starting to think my brain is fundamentally broken. I <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/30/placebo.html">can’t sleep</a>, can’t <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/27/210805.html">sit still,</a> and literally can’t do anything online without scrolling through social media.</p>
<p>It happens when I am not paying attention, and then I suddenly realise that post I sat down to write isn’t getting finished off, not are those photos getting edited. Instead, I am down a rabbit whole of the worst things about humanity or finding out why someone is getting cancelled on Twitter today.</p>
<p>I don’t think this is an attention thing like I have suffered from before, more of an entertainment need. Perhaps now is the time to take a step back from the online world and write more. That seemed to work for <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/when-im-coming-back-to-twitter/">Matt Birchler</a>, and was a big reason I had a <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/going-deeper/">very productive end of last year</a>.</p>
<p>It isn’t easy for me to quite social media because it&rsquo;s pretty much where all of my social interaction comes from (sad I know), but I am going to try.</p>
<p>❌ Twitter
❌ Reddit
❌ Instagram

      <p>For reasons that I <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/27/210805.html">don’t really want to go into,</a> I’ve had to resort to <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/29/wondered-why-the.html">sleeping tablets</a>. Nothing major, just <a href="https://www.nytol.co.uk/nytol-range/nytol-herbal">herbal things</a> to help me drop off and stay asleep. I’ve used them before, many years ago, and found they really help when I’m struggling to get enough shut-eye.</p>
<p>I popped the first one last night “30-60 minutes before bedtime” as instructed, but felt the effects in minutes. Except I couldn’t have. The tablet had barely reached my stomach, yet I felt tired purely because of placebo. My mind had already decided this tablet was going to make me sleepy, so exaggerated its effects.</p>
<p>It’s remarkable how much the placebo effect has on our lives. Every single human trial has to account for the fact your brain can fix things for you. Kind of makes me want to just take sugar pills instead and see if that puts me to sleep too.</p>
<p>Thankfully I went to sleep, and despite waking a couple of times went straight back to sleep and had a deep dream filled few hours for the first time in a long time.</p>

      <p>It doesn’t take more than a few minutes for the uncomfortable feeling to set in. Tiny little pin pricks that raise in intensity while I am still. Prodding me towards doing something, anything, just stop being still.</p>
<p>My attention hasn’t wandered. I am not bored, if anything I love being bored. Yet, my mind will not let me relax before it is reminding me to not waste my time and do something, anything.</p>
<p>Playing games, waste of time. You should be reading or working out, or writing, or doing something constructive. I have to make the most of the time I have, don’t I?</p>
<p>This is not a recent thing, either. It drives my wife up the wall because I am so restless. Stillness is the only indicator of when I am <em>really</em> ill.</p>
<p>For years, I have felt like I have to hack my life to constantly be better. I need to quit doing this, maximise that, do two things at once. My brain only has two states, and constant rages at me that whatever I am doing is either wrong or not done enough.</p>
<p>Even when I <em>am</em> still, I am thinking about what to do next.</p>

      <p>Over the last few weeks, I am having to spend more and more time in an office environment. There’s no rhyme or reason for it apart from the things I need to do need me to be there. I can slowly but surely feel my happy working from home routine being washed away.</p>
<p>I am dead sure there isn’t, but it feels like every little step is some kind of grand plan to remove ‘the new normal’ and return to the old way. Perhaps working as we always did <em>is</em> the way to do it, but all I know is that I am happier, healthier and more productive working in my own home.</p>
<p>Who knows what the future will bring, but the current requirements are playing on my mental health and productivity, and as a result my home life.</p>

      <p>Where to actually start? Every so often we see the once great Instagram app slide into oblivion, barely clinging on to its importance to the users that have used it for more than a decade. Unfortunately, there isn’t a service that comes close to the reach that Instagram has, but hopefully that will change if they keep going the way they are.</p><p>The latest round of excuses making is not new information, but when a <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/kim-kardashian-and-kylie-jenner-lock-horns-with-the-head-of-instagram-over-tiktok-redesign-12659928">Kardashian chips in,</a> companies tend to answer. With that said, this isn’t because of some altruistic intentions. The Kardashians make their living from social media, and clearly the effects of Meta changing the way the app works is affecting the bottom line.</p><p>Casey Newton summed this up expertly in an edition of his <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/kylie-jenner-smacks-the-new-instagram">Platformer newsletter</a> (paywall), an <a href="https://overcast.fm/+QN1qZ9HF0/34:12">episode of The Vergecast</a> and also a <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1551685200463028224?s=20&amp;t=1DKkMp3JQfZYs7yUMS6-1Q">widely shared Twitter thread</a>. He is dead right in conclusion — if you don’t like it, tough because Facebook has all the data, and it knows what it’s doing. Plus, it doesn’t care about you.</p><p>Adam Mosseri was <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1551890839584088065?s=20&amp;t=1DKkMp3JQfZYs7yUMS6-1Q">fairly quick to come out and answer some feedback</a> (again) following the Kardashian post. As if by magic, the same message is released, with intense stares into the camera and quick jump cuts between points. Because that’s how you do things to be down with the kids. It was long winded and clearly scripted but there are a couple of points to press on in this specific message.</p><h2 id="photos">Photos</h2><p>So, where does this leave photos. As a photographer, I wholeheartedly believe that Meta does not give a damn about photos. It is a legacy which they would get rid of if they could. All the surrounding words were half-hearted and stale. Using words like “continuing to support photos” without actually showing any excitement or reassurances to those that are left out.</p><p>With this shift to mobile first video, they are also forcing photographers to either use a terrible 16:9 vertical crop that is even worse than the 4:5 one that went before it. The alternative is having your photo fade out at the bottom and look terrible. None of this was pointed out in the video, however, because Adam is <em>loves</em> photos after all.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/445f9992d4.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><h2 id="video-reels">Video &amp; Reels</h2><p>The shift to videos was doubled down on. In no uncertain terms, this is <em>the</em> way Instagram is going, and its users are simply going to have to get used to it. In his words, “I do believe that more and more of Instagram is going to become video”.</p><p>The powers at Instagram see video as the future because they simply do not want you using another app, and TikTok is the single biggest threat that Meta (and others) have ever faced. As such, they will shove videos down users throats, so they realise that Instagram does video, and isn’t just a place to cross post them.</p><p>Adam pointed out that even if they don't change anything else, more and more videos are being shared and that’s what the users like. This may be the case, but you only have to look at the volume of users that <em>have to</em> post videos to get the engagement they used to. My evidence is of course anecdotal, but I have not met a simple photographer that posts a Reel apart from that they have to, or they lose work.</p><p>Not all video growth on Instagram is down to this, but a large percentage of people sharing videos are those that make money on social media and as such have no choice but to join in with Reels posting. Add into this the users who are now cross posting their TikTok videos to Instagram because why not, and you surely have a gigantic boost in video sharing with only a small algorithm change from Meta.</p><p>“If you look at what people like and consume on Instagram, that’s also shifting increasingly towards video”. These words stuck out to me the most, what Adam left out was the last part of the sentence, which should have been “because they have no choice”. Mine, as with many peoples, relationship with Instagram is tenuous at the best of times. I really hate it, but I have to post if I want more people to see my stuff. So, as <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/24/instagram-may-be.html">I said before</a>, I’ll just carry on until it’s gone.</p>

      <p>It was a bit blustery and choppy out on the water, but an enjoyable hour walk with the pooch. Headed to the south shore and went a bit further south on the path until we got to the boat harbour.</p>
<p>I wish I had taken a longer lens and managed to get a better shot of the boats, but this way is well worth another visit in the near future. Also a bit easer to shoot with it not being so sunny and reflecting off the water.</p>
<p>All shot on x100v.</p>

<p>&ldquo;“While Instagram initially fueled my passion for photography; rather than being inspired through the art of photography itself, too often I find myself chasing numbers of followers and likes. I realized that all this time I wanted to share my work to get a ‘pat on the back,’ rather than to inspire,” photographer Nicole Malina told PetaPixel.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Same same. But what is the solution for me to see all the photographers I enjoy following? Check up on all of their portfolios every so often? Use a different service with a fraction of the users?</p>
<p>Neither of these are tenable. Instead I’ll keep using it and hating it</p>

<p>&ldquo;TikTok is said to collect “everything”, from search and browsing histories; keystroke patterns; biometric identifiers—including faceprints, something that might be used in “unrelated facial recognition technology”, and voiceprints—location data; draft messages; metadata; and data stored on the clipboard, including text, images, and videos.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>There was a weird sense of misplaced attention when Trump tried to ban TikTok during his tenure. Perhaps it was just hyperbole at the time but as pointed out above the Chinese based company gathers ridiculously large amounts of data on users.</p>
<p>Including information on your clipboard, which could be passwords and other sensitive information.</p>
<p>Of course no uses will actually care because they get to watch silly videos and meme dances….</p>

      <p>Mike Elgin on the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3666739/why-open-plan-offices-are-a-disaster-for-your-company.html">hopeful demise of open plan offices</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The open-plan office obsession, which probably peaked around ten years ago, was based on what I’ve called “collaboration bias” — the under-examined assumption that ad-hoc social encounters are more valuable for business, creativity, and productivity than un-interrupted “deep work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The amount of time wasted in stupid takes should be enough for companies to realise. Yet the insistence of all being together and maximising collaboration is based on lack of trust.</p>
<p>No one trusts their staff and fail to understand the true importance of deep work.</p>

<p>It’s for bigger children to be honest otherwise it’s like any other inflatable park. However James managed to do loads of the course trials.</p>

      <p>I’ve struggled with my motivation and inspiration in photography for years. It’s been something I am always interested in, yet limited by the time and attention I can give it. I felt as if living in a sleepy (boring) town was difficult to take the pictures I wanted to take.</p>
<p>These feelings are ultimately driven by external forces. Looking at others that take amazing photos and live in cool places. It was easy to blame other things instead of improve my abilities.</p>
<p>So I decided to challenge myself to look at things differently. Pick somewhere and take different photos of it and look for things no one else had taken. My first stop was a local sculpture that I had taken one of my favourite shots of all time at. I aimed for 10 and got quite a few different images that I am happy with</p>

      <p>I always struggle to start writing a blog post, so I will just get right to it. There’s no more podcasts coming. I have taken it as far as I can with the time and energy I have available I’m afraid. So with a heavy heart it’s time to say good bye.</p><p>That’s not to say I haven’t enjoyed doing it, and this time around the guests have been fantastic and the conversations even better. The fact is I would just rather be doing other things with my time, and when things feel like a drag it's time for them to go.</p><p>The roughly one hour show I release every other week, takes around 2 hours to record. A further 3-4 to edit and then with time and evergy needed to book guests and do everything else, the time has come to sunset <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/">And You Are</a>.</p><p>My main passion presently is photography, and I am enjoying developing my skills and spending time with my camera in my hand. Combine this with my work and family life, as well as other things I enjoy doing, there just isn’t space in my life to continue.</p><p>I hope you have enjoyed the sporadic seasons as much as I have, and have been introduced to some new people to follow. I will be releasing a few episodes from the archive over the next few weeks, so they are all available, and then I will need to figure out a way to host them permanently without costing me a fortune.</p><p>As much as I am sad to see things end, this feels like the right thing to do at the moment. Well, you never know what the future holds I guess, but for now, this is the end of the road.</p><p>See Ya.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><a href="https://ljpuk.net/2022/06/22/blogging-consistently/">Lee Peterson</a> via <a href="https://jeffperry.me/2022/06/23/blogging-consistently/">Jeff Perry</a>:</p><blockquote>.. my blogging has almost completely stopped, it’s reinforcing that 80% of what I do here is done from my phone. As I adjust to using the iPhone Mini I’ll blog more I think, I just didn’t realise how much I did actually do from my mobile.</blockquote><p>I’m not one for reading something and writing a post straight off the bat, but this one did speak to me quite a bit. I too, struggle with consistency. My blogging comes in peaks and troughs. I used to beat myself up about this, but the reality is, it really doesn’t matter.</p><p>Blogging doesn’t need to be done a certain way, or at a certain rate, unless there is some outside stress that you need to consider. Unless you live from the page views, or get paid for the posts themselves, it doesn’t matter. Publish once a day/week/month/year it doesn’t matter, because you did it when you wanted to do it.</p><p>This is nothing against Lee, nor Jeff, they both write excellent things, and you should check them both out, but it's more to say that pushing isn’t always the way. If you’re doing something for the love of it, then make sure that love is always at the heart of it.</p><p>I’ve fallen down this trap before, and as great as publishing every day is, it’s a strain for no benefit. The same can be said for my photography on Instagram, when I started out, I felt like I had to post every day and grind out posts to get the followers. This just means I fall out of love with things.</p><p>It is interesting to think about the rate that things can change when circumstances do. I write mostly from my Mac, and have never really got in to it from my phone, but it is great to see that such excellent things can be done from their phone. I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-dont-need-a-blog/">love my blog</a>, and I could never not publish to it, but I will do it when I want to because I love it so much I never want to forget that love.</p>

      <p>My life is busy. Between work things, hospital appointments for my daughter and all the other things that life brings, myself and my family live out of our shared calendar. Don’t get me wrong, I get a lot of stuff done, yet I’ve never <em>really</em> nailed down <em>a process</em> that ensures I stay productive — well now is the time.</p><p>Inspiration for this kick in the ass comes from Matt D’Avella and his fascinating video on <a href="https://youtu.be/TSrFtCgV-RA">Bullet Journaling</a>. Instead of preaching the benefits of it and showing off the ridiculous artwork in his, like every other video on YouTuber, he actually <em>did</em> the practice and talked about the issues and covered the improvements it could make. So of course, me Googling bullet journals starts at least halfway through the video until I realise that’s just not going to work.</p><p>The reality is I have tried this before and although it starts well, and I spend a lot of time and money setting it up, the act of writing things down and remembering to check them doesn’t fit for me. That’s not to say it wouldn’t for everyone. Clearly there is a following out there, just take a look at the hundreds of videos made on the subject and the number of places that will sell you accessories to go with it. Manually doing something relies on me having a notebook with me all the time, and that’s never going to happen.</p><p><a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-cant-go/">Unfortunately</a>, I do carry around my phone with me near constantly, or at least have <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-ultimate-minimalist-phone/">my watch on my wrist</a>, so I need to lean on the tools I have. Digital means to get things done are everywhere, and it's important to not get <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-new-productivity/">distracted by shiny new things</a> and spend more time setting things up then getting things done. Taking <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/kia-kamgar/">inspiration from Kia</a>, I have made an internal agreement to only use apps I have already, particularly stock ones, or services that I already rely on and will not increase my expenditure.</p><p>This might take some time.</p>

      <p>The cursor blinks at me in a, what I interpret as, passive-aggressive way. Its yellow line set starkly against the black screen. Gently appearing and reappearing in the same place as if to utter to me that it hasn’t moved. I still haven’t typed anything, instead sat staring at my tormentor. <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/sitting-in-the/">Sitting in the chair</a>, but still unable to conjure up anything to fill this space.</p><p>Sounds easy when you say it out loud. Writing things, blog posts or instruction manuals or web copy. It’s the doing it that’s the hard bit. When you have a vocabulary as small as mine, you’ve perhaps typed out every word you know hundreds of times and now is <strong>the point</strong> where you wonder what is.</p><p>This might as well be dark magic I’m trying to use. I am <em>trying</em> to make something from nothing, but this is a blog post and not a demon to engulf the world. It shouldn’t be this hard.</p><p>Every skill is, though. You have to work at the things you want to do. Especially when you’re as poor at it as I, yet still kind of want to be a writer. Even more so than a fighter pilot I really wanted to be in year 5. Turns out my eyesight is about as good as my grammar, so I am screwed in both counts, but I digress.</p><p>Fuck you line. I’m going to type something now and prove you wrong. Opening up my writing app does work, and I can publish something. The words can be decided upon and put in some semblance of order. I can do this, it just takes time and effort to put the wheels in motion.</p><p>If I’m honest, writing would be a bit boring if it was easy. Yet, anyone can do it with a bit of effort and a mind that wonders. Even me.</p>

The sun was shining, the atmosphere was upbeat due to most of us having 4 days off work, yet as I looked around the campsite it was filled with people sat feet apart but looking glumly into their phone screen.</p><p>There was social interaction going on, but much of it was circling the phone screen. Sharing funny things they have found, or talking about doing a particular thing they had seen online. The internet is the social hub that controls almost all the interaction here.</p><p>Each person was more than able to gain the feedback and entertainment they needed, in person. Yet almost all appeared focused elsewhere entirely. As Richard Seymour outlined in the Twittering machine perfectly, all the of the people around me were using their smartphone to take them away without leaving. “It is as though we are both lonely and threatened by intimacy”.</p><p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07YM4N89C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">this book</a> – with all its nihilistic approach to social media – outlines a lot of what I observed, but did not make this site less of an eye-opener. “The Twittering Machine promises to give us access to everything, limitlessly, allowing us to transcend the limitations of mere flesh”. Of course, this behaviour is defended by those that have swallowed the marketing.</p><p>The truth is, we have been sold this idea that by being always connected and entertained, we are being more social. Facebook promises to “<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/">bring people closer together</a>” yet our society couldn’t be more apart than any time in human history. The tale that social media connects us together is a lie, and instead we are left with people that value connectivity over the internet more than with the people around them.</p><p>Scoring internet points and sharing memes is not social. Talking, interacting and engaging is. These things <em>can</em> happen over the internet, I have some great group chats and social media interactions that provide this, but none of this is facilitated by the companies. What they really want is for users to feed it so full of data that it can sell you things. Becoming so big that people feel at a detriment for not being part of the fake conversation.</p><p>Those that do not want to adopt these modern tropes feel obliged to explain themselves to others. Feeling judged and looked down on because they do not conform. Made a social outcast by the very people they are trying to interact with on a personal level. It seems apt that many conspiracy theorists refer to those that believe the prevailing narrative as sheep, when the reverse is true to those that will not swallow the social media lie.</p><p>There is no social in social media if it takes us away from the world around us. If we sit in huddles with others and stare at our phones, in any of this.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For the last few months, I have been trying to work out why I can’t be bothered with tech any more. I have felt these feeling before, but always come around again when something happens, or I just come out of the rut. Don’t get me wrong. I have long given up writing about it in any great details, I leave that to people better at it than I, but this time is different – I just can’t be bothered with it at all.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I still read about it and keep slightly up to date with news, but most of it is just met with a shrug. Thankfully, I worked out my feelings while reading <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/how-dall-e-could-power-a-creative">Platformer</a> this morning, and I think it’s because the wonderment has gone.</p><blockquote>What makes these moments stand out, I think, is the sense that some unpredictable set of new possibilities had been unlocked. — Casey Newton</blockquote><p>There are a few things in my life I still look back on that created these feelings of amazement. The “oh shit” moments that technology improvement split my life into a before and after section. The first time I logged into Yahoo chat and the person I spoke to was from the USA, the first time I downloaded a song from the internet instead of needing a tape. Google Assistant speaking the answer to a question straight back to me, or filling my room with sound from one Sonos speaker.</p><p>The list could go on and on, but all of these things seem very far behind me. Where have my “Oh shit” moments gone, and what could create them going forward? In the post above, Casey talks about AI providing the next line in the sand that we will all remember. The moment where the world changed forever, and you look back on to remember where you were when it all changed.</p><p>Perhaps Casey’s right, it could be a long way off, but Ai advancements will provide a real change to the way the world works. What won't provide it is Apple putting widgets on my lock screen, or being able to shoot a photo at 3x instead of 2x. My world of tech has slowed, and it is perhaps no longer about world-changing moments and instead slow progress forward which can mostly be ignored.</p>

      <p>At the end of last week, I went off the grid. We packed our car full of camping equipment, turned all the gadgets off , placed them in a draw, and went into the wilderness. Well, that’s not quite true, we were nowhere near wilderness on a camping site with showers and entertainment – however we were as far as we can realistically go with Lucie’s disability.</p><p>Four days, spent doing nothing but walking, talking and enjoying each other's company. There might have been a bit of drinking and eating going on too, but it was a wonderful experience to just unplug and get away from everything. I did take <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/camping-for-the-jubalee/">my camera with me</a>, but it was the only electronic thing we had with us. No phones, <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/06/02/im-going-off.html">no watches,</a> and nothing to take your attention away from the present time.</p><p>I would like to say it was a glorious experience. Indeed, it was a very enjoyable one, and we had lots of fun and learnt lots about each other and ourselves. However, in times like this, you realise just what a difference tech makes to your life and you as a person. I have written several times about my realisation that to truly live in a modern world, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-cant-go/">you can’t be completely disconnected</a>. The world always needs an online application here, and an app for banking there – but there is nothing like just pulling the plug for a bit.</p><p>I observed numerous behaviours in myself that are totally technology-based. I found myself trying to check my email on my watch, despite not having one on. Not only that, but I tried to claim my Costa points despite having no phone, and I lost count of the number of times I swear I could feel my phone vibrating. Despite all this weirdness, it was fantastic, and I will do it again more often.</p><p>I am already in a habit of leaving my phone at home and relying on <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-ultimate-minimalist-phone/">my favourite minimalist phone</a>, but I am determined to try to do more. I truly think a period of going offline should be mandatory for everyone. Even if you discover you hate it, you’ll appreciate it even more.</p>

      <p>Even though I shot about 200 photos over the 3 days <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CealItBMKXv/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">we spent camping,</a> I ventured out today to shoot some street photography. It’s like mediation for me and I faced a bit of time out. The weather was a bit rubbish, and the light a bit muted, but I just wanted to get out and shoot a bit for something to do.</p><p>This was the first time trying to shoot in the street following my switch from <a href="/2022/04/16/mm-for-street.html">my beloved Sony 85mm</a> to 35mm on <a href="/2022/06/01/keep-it-simple.html">the x100v</a>. I really struggled to get comfortable, feeling far too close to everything and everyone. At times I felt like giving up entirely and throwing this camera in the bin.</p><p>I struggled to find much to shoot, and those I did capture were not very interesting. Every single shot was deleted in camera. I came home dejected, felling like a failure and wondering why I bother. If I didn’t <a href="/2022/06/01/keep-it-simple.html">love this camera</a> in other situations so much, I would have listed it straight away on eBay!</p><p>Given a few breaths and a drive home, it’s easy to see the answer is to work harder and practice. To become a better photographer with a 35mm lens and stop worrying. Some days just go like that, and you don’t see anything or don’t feel very inspired. In truth, what I don’t want to do is just take the same shots as others, or shoot for the sake of it. By failing, I have learnt something.</p><p>It’s easier to buy new things. There is a whole world out there telling you to buy this and that. Solving any problem you have with new shiny things and mounting up your debt. It’s something I have done before even when I got nice shots, so when I don’t the feelings can become even worse.</p><p>It won’t make me give up though, just feel a little disappointed for a while and then just get on with it. Such is life.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>You might have heard this term, commonly referred to as KISS, it is used in training for almost any subject you can think of. Indeed, it has become a bit of cliché but KISS relates to so many things and points in life that it should be a mantra to everyone. Keep everything in life as simple as possible, always.</p><p>Call it minimalism or whatever you want, but again it has raised importance in my life to do with photography. You may have noticed, or may not even care, that my rate of sharing photos has changed. I am sharing lots because I am taking lots, and that’s because I’m keeping it simple (and I’m stupid).</p><p>Since getting into photography 4-5 years ago, I’ve been on a mission of Gear acquisition. Buying new stuff whenever I could, and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/having-a-camera/">selling a few things too</a> because I thought that’s what I needed. Every time I took photos, I focused on the things I missed and not the improvements I was making. Compared my pictures to those that I admired and convinced myself that I needed a full frame camera, or some fancy glass. That I could be even better with better stuff. Despite me knowing that this has very little to do with it, whenever I looked at others I wanted their stuff and not their talent.</p><p>The thing with camera gear is there isn’t really a ceiling, so it could get idiotic. However, I was sensible, and came to a decision a few weeks ago that I didn’t want to have a ‘proper camera’ any more and I wanted to change things. Out goes full frame cameras and more lenses than I know what to do with, and in comes a Fujifilm x100v.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can’t tell you how much I love carrying around my <a href="https://twitter.com/FujifilmUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FujifilmUK</a> x100v. <br /><br />It’s made me capture so many things that I wouldn’t have with a ‘proper camera’ and made photography fun again. <a href="https://t.co/dOSLlEdSz5">pic.twitter.com/dOSLlEdSz5</a></p>— Greg Morris (@GR36) <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1531657059099361280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2022</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>I honestly can’t tell you how much of a revaluation this has been. I watched enough reviews and videos on the camera to know that others feel this too, but I never expected it. This small camera with a fixed lens just makes me want to take photos again. There are no lenses I can lust after, no settings videos I need to brush up on, it’s almost point and shoot.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/172d2acfa7.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>I guess it could also be said that it’s making me take simple images. No more worrying about being all arty, just take photos that catch my eye. With less expectation from the photos I take, I relax a bit more and enjoy shooting. It’s so small and light I take it to more places, I feel more comfortable shooting with it, and to be honest, I just love the way it looks.</p><p>The x100v also allows me to simplify the camera itself. It spends most of the time in aperture priority and the camera does the rest. Even the JPEG’s coming out of it are great. I love this little thing because it keeps it simple.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Do I try to force myself to write something, or let it come back on its own? The hard to take fact is that after months of having loads of inspiration on subjects to write about, the juices (and to a certain extent motivation) have dried up.</p>
<p>The truth is that I don’t want to force anything out just because I feel I need to. In the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don’t write because you want to say something, you write because you have something to say.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the minute, I just don’t. My brain is a wash with taking more <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/">photos</a>, designing new things and generally absorbing information instead of sending it out. So, when I sit down to write anything, there is nothing worthy that comes out – well, nothing I want to see published to the internet at least.</p>
<p>There are so many things that I just don’t care about any more. I can’t ever see myself writing another tech review, or going any deeper than fleeting hot takes on tech topics, I just enjoy doing different things now, and I think that’s OK.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>We had a nice day to day, for a bit at least. A day out at the seaside with the kids and enjoyed a bit of time on the beach. Enjoyable but exhausting.</p>
<p>You know the feeling when you get home a after a long day, you&rsquo;re delighted to be home and just want to relax for a while. Yet, the universe had other ideas for us. Lucie&rsquo;s feeding tube wouldn’t work correctly, and after some trial and error, we found out it was the button in her tummy that was broken. We couldn’t feed her.</p>
<p><img src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/00655f3a3c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So off we go to hospital. It’s 6pm at night and shouldn’t take that long for them to get us a new one and change it. It’s a 3-minute job maximum. How wrong could we be?</p>
<p>We waited an hour just to talk to a nurse, she disappeared, never to return. Therefore, we waited another hour just to talk to another person. All the time, Lucie hasn’t had anything to eat or drink for hours and is getting increasingly frustrated—as are we. There’s more to this story that I won’t go into, but needless to say we didn’t leave the hospital for almost 4 hours.</p>
<p>I love that we have the NHS in the UK, but it’s times like these that you really struggle to stay zen. The calmness you feel is really tested when you are dealing with organisations or individuals that seem set to try you. Almost as if the universe is playing a game with you to see if this good mood you’re in can last. You try to smile and laugh as much as you can, but the game can push you to the limit at times.</p>
<p>Just as we are about to leave the doctor turns up, takes less than a minute to change the button and we are on our way a little before 10pm. Thank goodness.</p>

      <p>Like everyone else that uses LinkedIn I get the occasional notification on jobs we think you might be interested in. I am not, but I always have a look anyway to see what’s out there.</p>
<p>The list just now was pretty long, and contained some high profile names looking for new talent. However it took me until the 12th listing to see one with a salary outlined! It only got worse form then on, because it was the only one of 42 jobs that told me how much the alert would be.</p>
<p>Weird that we are still hiding the numbers and seeing what talent we can get and only showing our hand at the last possible moment.</p>
<p>Many is not the only thing that matters, but its pretty important given the current climate don’t you think.</p>

      <p>It doesn’t take a lot to see how frustrating some people can be. Here I was in a happy little bubble and thinking the world was getting better and twitter was an OK place to be again.. and then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/08/doctor-who-ncuti-gatwas-irrepressible-rise-to-new-time-lord">Doctor Who was announced as a Black man</a></p>
<p>I am still not convinced that most of the outrage and general bigoted tweets are real. Much like flat earth, I think there is an in-joke I just don’t get. Or perhaps this is my minds defence mechanism for convincing myself that the world really isn’t as bad as it seems? This is all got to be just for attention, or internet points or something right?</p>
<p>Anyway, my good mood continues, but perhaps my positiveness towards social media does not.</p>

      <p>About an hour ago, I decided I was going to sign up for a year of micro.blog and <a href="https://twitter.com/gr36/status/1519652342257303552?s=21&amp;t=F3PIAUwtfLJcUg4EdriRsg">start sharing more things</a>. I’d just finished the 7th day straight on using our home cross trainer as part of our <a href="https://twitter.com/gr36/status/1519995151191613440?s=21&amp;t=F3PIAUwtfLJcUg4EdriRsg">monthly challenge</a> and wanted to write something. These kinds of posts would really fit into my blog, and decided somewhere else might be better—but then it hit me just how stupid that was.</p>
<p>What exactly was I wanting to write a post for? To show how great I am, but not let it interfere with this illusion that my blog is somehow professional? I have no idea, to be honest.</p>
<p>But then again, I have no idea why I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/scared-of-stopping-sharing/">share so much stuff already</a>, and indeed want to share more. Perhaps I have let the ego in too much, and it wants some praise for a task I am doing just for a bit of fun with my wife?</p>
<p>She’s still convinced she’s going to win, by the way! Never going to happen.</p>

      <p>I recorded another episode of <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/">my podcast</a> last night, and the guest gave me such an inspiring speech that I almost wanted to release the episode straight away. I won’t, for fear of all the coughing and dad jokes (it will follow soon enough) but the words are still ringing in my head.</p><p>How you master your craft is to just get on and do it. We spoke specifically about writing and all the crap that goes on around it, but it could easily be applicable to any other art form you choose. You simply can’t become good at something without practicing and just keeping your head down and moving forward.</p><p>A while ago, I came to the realisation that there are no shortcuts to being a good photographer. Much like <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/sitting-in-the/">sitting in the chair</a>, you just need to get out and take photos. You don’t need fancy glass, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/you-probably-dont-need-a-new-thing/">a new camera</a> or anything else. It doesn’t matter where you share the images, pick <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/glass-feelings/">Glass</a>, or <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-glass-half-full/">Instagram</a>, or send them out my email if it suits you. If you want to take good pictures, you have to take pictures, and lots of them.</p><p>In writing terms, it simply doesn’t matter what blogging platform you use, what newsletter you decide to do, nor what computer you choose to do it on. If that is what you aim to do, and be good at it, you just need to keep on doing it. Consistently. Constantly, and not worry about anything else. If this doesn’t sound appealing to you, perhaps whatever it is that you are trying to do isn’t that important to you after all.</p><p>Spending money doesn’t make you good at something. The equipment you use doesn’t make you good at something. The way you look doesn’t make you good at something. Only you make you good at something, and it’s time to get on and do it.</p>

      <p>Trying to form my desires and intentions for sharing online is hard. There are a few things I want to do, and a few more I would like to do but probably won’t and then a few more that I would like to cut out.</p><p>The motivation to put my ducks and a row is not prompted by Elon, but when others are <a href="https://mph.puddingbowl.org/2022/04/29/232402.html">doing and writing about </a>the same thing currently, it could well be a slight motivating factor.</p><p>I haven’t formed any opinion on the Twitter thing, partly because I don’t really care. I am lucky in the sense that I haven’t experienced any of the issues that <em>may</em>increase with a less carefully approach. However, I can’t get emotional about something that hasn’t changed (yet) and I may <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/twitter-muscle-memory/">struggle to give up my beloved Twitter </a>if anything ever did.</p><p>My sharing online was at a point not too long ago where I almost <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/scared-of-stopping-sharing/">walked away entirely.</a> I have absolutely no idea why I continue to share what I do, why I feel the need to tweet many things, and have given up trying to work it out. I have not got to the stage where <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/matt-birchler/">my brain thinks in 280 characters</a>, but I am not far away from a life like this.</p><p>There is no doubt in my mind that Twitter affects my concentration and my attention span. Yet, even knowing this, there would have to be something pretty dramatic to stop me from using it. Sure I can be intentional about its usage, I do limit myself a little and still stay engaged with life, but until Elon burns it down I will still keep coming back.</p><p>Twitter has given me so much positive in my life, it may never reach a net negative. Meeting people, finding out things and providing comfort when I need it most keep me coming back time and time again, and I don’t see that ever-changing.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The app's first words to me about Spaces were “What the #$@!% is that” and I entirely agree. I hate that little icon that plagues my Twitter app screen. I think it’s supposed to be a microphone, but I vaguely remember it being something different. The powers that be at Twitter have decided to leave it with me with no option of removing it, but my opinions are changing.</p><p>Last night, myself and <a href="https://twitter.com/iamJeffPerry">Jeff Perry</a> decided to set up a Twitter space and <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1DXxyDXjkvRJM?s=20">have a chat about tech</a>. There’s no messing about, no need for microphones, or a recording set up at all. All you require is a phone and away you go, and there is something really freeing about that.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I enjoyed this chat and it was really easy to set up. I’m sold on the Spaces idea now. <a href="https://t.co/AC0lBB3TRl">https://t.co/AC0lBB3TRl</a></p>— Greg Morris (@GR36) <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1520669229384704000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2022</a></blockquote> <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Of course, if you’ve been into voice first social media, this is all old news. Services like <a href="https://www.clubhouse.com">Club House</a> have been providing spaces for people to chat for a couple of years already. Proving that there is a desire for people to use their voice rather than type out words and also help remove some of the nuance that 280 characters often provides.</p><p>The ease of use and the tools that Twitter Spaces provides has proven to me the usefulness of the service with just one try. Closed captions, visual indication of listers, sharing links you discuss into the chat – all of <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces">these features</a> that are only obvious once you use it, make it a well-rounded feature after all. I do still wish they wouldn’t keep ramming it down our throats.</p><p>Like they did with <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/introducing-fleets-new-way-to-join-the-conversation">Fleets</a>, the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/goodbye-fleets">not long for this world</a> disappearing version of tweets, Twitter uses its app to leverage adoption of new features. Often annoying users to the point they give up, or switch to a third-party app to avoid the nonsense. The icon is one thing, but I have found a big blue bubble <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1519354301432406016?s=20&amp;t=1leQDxPuqgBXMI1y2HIXeA">attached to the top of my home screen</a> more times than I care to mention, simply because someone I follow is listening to a live Space. With no option to hide it I have listened in to some of them, but never really have the time to stay for long.</p><p>I would guess most people won’t either. Twitter is small tweets while you’re doing something, and unless it is something I really want to take in live, I rarely have the time to stop and listen if I catch one ad-hoc. Which makes Twitter Spaces a confusing proposition. All the shenanigans put me off initially, I can see the value in the service with ease of use, but ultimately am not convinced Twitter is the place for it.</p>

      <p>Eric Migicovsky on <a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/why-pebble-failed-d7be937c6232">Why Pebble failed</a>:</p><blockquote>Looking back with hindsight, I should not have aggressively grown the company without a stronger plan. We should have just stuck to what we knew best and continued to build quirky, fun smartwatches for hackers.</blockquote><p>There is a lot to take way from this article, so I will keep it brief, but it’s rare to see a founder admit the mistakes made and especially so publicly. I love Pebble, it was the first smartwatch I truly used and was the first and only time I helped found something on Kickstarter (RIP my red founders edition).</p><p>Despite its relative success between nerds, you’d be hard pushed to find an average person who knows what a Pebble watch was, and this is part of the failure.</p><blockquote>Around this time Apple came out with the Apple Watch and we thought the smartwatch market was about to explode. So in a quest for big sales growth, we figured our 2015 strategy would need to shift focus to a broader market, away from our core early adopter market positioning.</blockquote><p>It’s reasonable to expect boom time once Apple got involve, however instead of appealing to the crowd they had already made they tried to appeal to more people. Instead of remaining true to their hacker nature, they pumped money into features and tried to become mainstream. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but I wonder if, at a time that even the Apple Watch didn’t know what it was, Pebble could have carved out a place in the heart of users that wanted something hackable.</p><p>However, we can but dream. I am not certain that Pebble would still be alive today. They would have undoubtably been swallowed up by a bigger company, but it would have been great to see what they could have achieved with another few years under their belt. As great as seeking investors can be for boosting a business, the constant need to see return and strive to be a success is dangerous.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I woke to an email about an ancient <a href="https://github.com/gr36/Shortcuts">Shortcuts repo</a> I had stored old backup files in. They were available as a place to save Shortcut files I had written about because the iCloud link sharing can be a bit flaky. They were so old it contained loads of .wflow files and I had forgotten it even existed, but they now need to be signed to work with iOS15.</p>
<p>Of course, I felt no need to update these, but thought it should be pretty simple, so tried to get them updated anyway. Unfortunately, I was wrong and the lack of detail in how to do this is pretty poor, but with a bit of trial and error I got them signed without issue – I hope.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>You will need a Mac to do this. It is the only way I have found to reliably get everything signed using the command line. Some information online suggest that it can be done on iOS using SSH, but I couldn’t get <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/pich0y/shortcut_source_helper_helper_for_shortcut_plist/">this to work</a>, and it felt very fiddly.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/714b9d8669.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>So to use <em>this</em> guide, you will need a Mac running macOS Monterey and be able to use the terminal app on your device.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-sign-the-shortcut">How To Sign The Shortcut</h2>
<p>Open terminal on your Mac, and cd into the folder containing the shortcut files. Use the following command to sign the shortcut file:</p>
<pre><code>shortcuts sign -i a.wflow -o b.wflow</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>a.wflow</code> is the name of the shortcuts file, and <code>b.wflow</code> is the name you want the signed Shortcuts file to be called. Due to the weirdness in names, I actually found it easier to rename my source file as ‘a’ and then rename ‘b’ to whatever I wanted it to become.</p>
<p>Who knows if Apple will change the requirement yet again, but for the time being, you will now be able to load the file into shortcuts on Mac or iOS without issue, as the new file is now signed.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Although there are a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqKkn7kpvto&t=931s">few people</a> who sometimes use a longer lens for Street Photography, there are far more that dismiss a longer focal length. The internet is filled with posts telling you to buy a 28mm, or a 35mm or at most a 50mm lens. Sure they are all good options (who doesn’t like a nifty 50) but it doesn’t have to be that way.</p><p>The fact I don’t have to stand so close to people is the one over arching thing that makes a longer length so great. When you’re just starting out, or <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/lincoln-street-photography/">still learning like I am</a>, a 85mm length is great. Allowing you to get the up close and personal shots that make street photography so great, but not have to deal with the people that go with it.</p>
<img src="uploads/2024/2f09c7cb46.jpg">
<p>Some of this is confidence, I have absolutely no motivation to go up to someone and ask them if it's OK, nor would I ever point my camera at someone right in front of me and a longer focal length means I am less likely to have to. When some photographers talk about the candidness of a tiny little lens, I get the same feeling with my 85mm f/1.8 Sony lens. Taking pictures becomes easy and worry free.</p>
<p>
Typically, photographers think a 50mm lens would be smaller too, but not any more. If I wanted to keep a fast lens in 50mm I would be lugging around the SEL50F12GM at 778g (not to mention the £2,099 price tag), or loose around a stop of light on the SEL50F25G at a fantastic 174 g. Whereas the SEL85F18 I have strikes a great balance at 371g and a very affordable £400.</p>
<img src="uploads/2024/5a338c2342.jpg">
<p>Using my A7c and a 85mm prime is the perfect combination of nice and light with enough ability to capture the shots I really want and be a little more removed from the subjects. This may change with confidence and progression, but let it be said that you simply do not need to buy some expensive glass nor stand really close to people to get great shots. I love 85mm for almost everything, and you might too.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>There are far too many things in my life that I don’t really need. I don’t need half the technology I have, nor most of the myriad of online services that I pay for. These include the hosting for my blog. I don’t need it really, but it serves a purpose deeper than the small amount it costs me each month and gives me tremendous value anyway.</p><p>My blog has been up for more than a decade (the earliest post I still have is from 2014) and it has been through numerous changes. The most recent of which was an <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-new-home/">investment in the new domain</a> last year, but the hours poured into it outweighs the monetary costs significantly.</p><p>My blog has been many things over the years, attempted portfolios, business ventures and had any number of facelifts but still mainly provides an outlet for me. In theory this website provides very little to me, it doesn’t get me anywhere, my life would be the same if I didn’t have a blog, but I still want to have one.</p><p>Call it a hobby if you will, but writing gives me something that nothing else provides. I love talking to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/">people on my podcast</a>, and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-obsidian-set/">I love journaling</a>, but getting thoughts to the stage where they can be published (even rushed ones) helps me tremendously. So, when thinking about things you need, it is not always a simple equation that can be worked out. Just because on the surface it gives me nothing in return doesn’t mean it has no value to me. In fact, the opposite, and I would argue that more people should have one.</p><p>The benefits of it run far deeper than the sum of its parts. No person should judge their blog based on the number of views the posts get because it always serves a different purpose. It allows you to publish whatever it is you want to publish, get it out of your brain and own it from start to end. I don’t need a blog, but everyone should have one.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I am not one to write about business. Not because I don’t think it’s valuable to have opinions about it, but just because I don’t think I have many important things to say. My working life thankfully has been pretty simple, and I am not about to pretend to have magic insights to improve yours. I do come across a certain type of person though and I would like to warn you against becoming one.</p><p>The busy fool is easy to spot. They are often very gifted in the position they are in, but need to lean on everyone else around them more than they should do. Their demeanour leads you in to the vicinity of the busy fool because they are always busy with something. It is only when you get closer to them that you realise that numerous things are going on, but very little is achieved.</p><p>There is very little that can be done to help this scourge of your business because they have very regularly worked their way into a more senior position. Unfortunately, this is the cause of their affliction, and their lack of output doesn’t seem to matter any longer. Without the clear indicators that come with lower positions, they have replaced productivity with busyness and imploded into themselves.</p><p>Implied stress from workload is all of their doing. You see, the busy fool is a business mime act. Displaying all the outside actions of achievement and high output, yet under the surface there is no substance to their bluster. Identifiable by last-minute preparations for every task, pleads for help on basic things they have no time to complete, and constant instance that they have too much to do.</p><p>Do not fall into the trap by convincing yourself you are productive when you are just busy.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I am one of those people that constantly strives to do things better. Always looking out for tips that help get things done simpler, and also seeking simplifications to processes that <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/kia-kamgar/">Kia Kamgar</a> would be proud of. Yet, there are things that seem long-winded, perhaps a little messy, but just need to be left alone.</p><p>When looking for all these gains there is a tendency to go a little too far. You see tech bros and CEO’s trying far too hard to hack everything to find gains. Some which make perfect sense, shaving some time here and there, particularly in a busy life, pays for itself in a short period of time. However some are changed just for changing sake.</p><p>As Anna Winer puts it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_Valley_(memoir)">Uncanny Valley</a> “Reading wasn’t about mainlining information. The tech industry’s efficiency fetish was so dreary”. Some things just need to be slow and not the most efficient way of doing things. Yet provide the best return for your investment. Take reading for example, more and more services are sprouting up to <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/">cut all the corners</a> and give you the book in a faction of the time it takes to read. This might pay off for some, but hacking reading seems like something that wouldn’t be that useful.</p><p>The joy is <em>in</em> the reading. Absorbing the information at your pace, and thinking about things as you read them. Much like <a href="/2019/04/29/skipping-silence.html">trimming the silence from your podcasts </a>(don’t do that either) often it is reading between the lines and applying your experiences that provide the most feedback. I could have dictated this whole blog post instead of writing it out. Or perhaps recored it as a voice note. Yet, the process of writing it out, editing and trimming along with everything else that goes into it is as enjoyable as the result.</p><p>Simplifying processes saves not only time and effort, but typically money. Meaning, you win on all fronts and improve your life for the better. However, this doesn’t apply to everything, you can’t hack some things, and they are just better left alone.</p>

      <p>There have already been many words written about the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/considering-jumping-the/">walled gardens</a> of tech companies. Usually reserved for talk about Apple and its tight grip, it’s also a long-term aim of almost every company. Build a reliance on your company that runs too deep to change, and you will have a customer for life but perhaps a frustrated one.</p><p>You can achieve this in many ways. You can’t simply build a product that is so good that others pale in comparison because, eventually, someone else will either copy or overtake you. There needs to be a grip that keeps a customer, and the strongest grip in technology circles is to provide everything your customers may ever need. There is no denying this approach when I think about my purchases and reliance on Apple, but it isn’t just about what they sell.</p><p>The reality is, for me at least, the premium I pay for the products I buy from Apple is a worthy exchange for the service I get. Not only is it a well-rounded software and hardware experience, unlike any other I have experienced. The purchasing service and the after sales support is unmatched. I can’t find another company that provides me with a complete wrap around service that Apple does, and although it feels trapping at times, it gives me a huge amount of confidence.</p><p>I appreciate the level of service that Apple gives in retail is not as good as it used to be. Some interactions feel more like a sales pitch than a support visit. With that said I have experienced, in the past Samsung and more <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/nordictrack-cross-trainer-resistance-too-high-heres-the-fix/">recently Nordictrack</a>, customer service once I have made a significant purchase and nothing seems to live up.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that I cannot be critical of the things I use, nor does it mean I am not open to new experiences. It simply means that I am aware of what keeps me using Apple products, and it isn’t just the fact I am trapped by services. App stores and competition of services doesn’t really bother me, but a company I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/where-to-put/">put my investment</a> in providing good service does — as such I am, unfortunately, stuck!</p>

      <p>There is a tale to be told here. One that having a blog sometimes feels a little like having an unpaid job. A job that you feel like you should be doing better and more often than you are, but I reality you don’t owe anyone that obligation.</p><p>The feelings of owing the people who read and subscribe to my blog at least some kind of activity have been circling for years. In 2018, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-was-going/">I struggled with the motivation</a> to do it, and despite improving my drive to publish, and even picking up <a href="https://thedent.net/the-denties2021/">an award</a> for doing so, the motivation still comes and goes.</p><p>Despite my desire to push things out, I still think the peaks and troughs of publishing just need to be ridden. There is little point going through the motions for little reward, I’d rather wait until I have <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/something-to-say/">something to say</a> rather than waste your time. The constant changing requirements in my life mean that for long periods I don’t have the energy remaining to catch up on the latest news. Despite now doing <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/aya/">one of my own</a>, my podcast consumption remains low, and almost every article I read and want to make a comment on I do so in <a href="https://getmatter.app/gr36/">Matter</a>.</p><p>Having different outlets is great, but doesn’t get away from the fact I want to write more things. My desire to write and publish never leaves me, but the motivation or time to do so frequently does. Life has this funny way of getting in the way of everything else that you would like to do doesn’t it. By the time the day is done, I have done too much staring at a screen that even a little while longer to bang some keys seems like too much.</p><p>With all this said, I shouldn’t feel like I need to. There is no reason for me to worry about those that enjoy my things because they won't stop. They may just be a little delayed while I attempt to write something.</p>

      <p>Unless you’ve been living under a technology rock, or simply don’t care, you can’t escape European legislation trying to cub technology companies. Investigating, charging and regulating the world's largest and most influential companies can be tough, but they seem to finally be getting a handle on things. Yet, what seems easy could be impossibly hard to achieve.</p><p>The latest round of legislation by the EU, termed the Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims to <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2022/03/26/will-the-digital-markets-act-help-europe-breed-digital-giants">level playing fields</a> dominated by a few companies. Despite containing many well-educated and thoughtful changes to current acts, including increasing the responsibilities of companies deemed large enough to be “gatekeepers”, the focus has been on messaging interoperability. The ability to send a message from one app to another.</p><p>Make sense in theory, doesn’t it. The EU want my messaging app to be able to send a message to anyone else's messenger app, and not be locked into using one companies service. People have long talked about iMessage lock in, which in Europe is substituted by WhatsApp lock in (which thankfully is available on every platform). Messaging should function as a universal or accepted standard. Take email for example, I can send the same message to another email address regardless if that is a gmail, hotmail or custom domain. The EU argue messaging should be the same, a user should not be restricted to what service they want to use.</p><p>Messaging is different though. It’s messy, controlled by big players and tech giants that either start up a service or buy a service that already has a large user base. With this kind of control comes benefits. Unlike phone calls, emails and sms messages that are all interoperable, the best messaging apps are encrypted — often end to end. So, interoperability is essentially impossible.</p><p>Perhaps that’s the point. The EU powers know that interoperability should be easy but is, in fact, a privacy breaking ruling of epic proportion. We already know that the powers in charge don’t like encryption, they love snooping on your information and arguing it's for your protection. They know that the average Joe won't care and only half understand the issues at hand. Instead, arguing for the ability to be able to message their friend on WhatsApp with their Telegram account.</p><p>Interoperability and big tech giants are not the real target, your privacy is, and they want the right to snoop on you. Sure, messaging <em>should</em> work like email, but the governments of your country made a world that requires your messages to be encrypted and are now breaking it with something ‘simple’.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>As excited as I was to unpack my new purchase as soon as it arrived, that was all dispersed the first time I used my Nordictrack SE7i Cross Trainer. The resistance felt far too high, and I puffed and panted my way through 15 minutes despite being used to doing an hour on others.</p>
<p>I put this down to being a little unfit, or maybe I just needed to get used to this specific version. However, the shine was well and truly dulled by my first experience. Thankfully, for my sanity, I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nordictrack/comments/g8iuev/resistance_became_way_too_high/">wasn’t alone</a>. Several people were having the same issue on brand-new machines, some of which returned their purchases because of this. To say the Nordictrack customer service doesn’t have a great reputation is an understatement — not to worry, here’s the fix to the resistance being too high on your equipment.</p>
<p>After watching <a href="https://youtu.be/B1J_i3k55Es">this video</a> to see how things worked, it’s easy to see there is some adjustment to the tension management cable. Numerous people have done this and made walk through video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ2D806K1V0">their version</a>, but thankfully my Nordictrack SE7i or S700 wasn’t nearly as complicated.</p>
<p>You will need a screwdriver and small spanner. Remember, you do this at completely your own risk, and keep in mind this may void your warranty.</p>
<h2 id="1-remove-the-footplate">1 Remove the footplate</h2>
<p>Four screws at the back of the machine will mean you can remove the foot that the machine will stand on if you fold it up.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1508c9bc61.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="2-remove-the-surround">2 Remove the Surround</h2>
<p>Two more screws to remove on the top above the footplate.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b90c98a6c3.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Once removed, you can remove the curved surround from the back of the machine.</p>
<h2 id="3-find-and-adjust-the-cable">3 Find and adjust the cable</h2>
<p>One removed, you will be able to see inside the read of the Nordictrack Cross Trainer. Look down on the machine’s right-hand side, you will see the silver cable join that you need to adjust.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3b94a01661.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Mine was finger tight, but you may need a small spanner to make adjust the resistance. To accomplish this, first loosen the smaller nut away from the longer piece. Then you can adjust the longer piece to your desired effect. Unscrewing makes the resistance decrease, tightening makes the resistance increase.</p>
<p>For more information, watch the below section of video.</p>

<p>The advantage of not taking lots of the machine apart is you can now test and readjust as required. Mine required lots of loosening. iFit recommends a starting point in their workouts of resistance level 7, but your ability will vary.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>It’s very unlike the world of Twitter to lose its mind when the company changes something about its app or service. More words were written about the move to <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself">240 characters</a> than the world needed, but most users just get used to the noise. Some throw all the toys out the pram and quit. Perhaps move to Mastodon for an hour and come back, but as a Twitter developer, you have to expect the outrage when you mess with the timeline.</p><p>For some strange reason, Twitter have been obsessed with forcing users, or at least fooling them, to use their <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-timeline">‘home’ feed</a> for a very long time. One not composed of reverse chronological tweets. Instead, filled with spammy content to boost engagement, 7 different tweets that someone you forgot you followed liked, and random topics someone somewhere decided you might not hate.</p><p>This week was no different. The big brains at the blue bird decided instead of being able to tap an icon and switch between the way your timeline displays, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/twitter-just-made-a-big-change-to-our-timelines-and-i-hate-it">both need to be pinned side by side</a>.</p><p>There’s no denying that, when social networks get to a certain size, some algorithmic sorting and pruning is recommended. Simply so users can deal with the sheer value of information. It’s simply a <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-problem-of/">product of scale</a> that needs to addressed at some point or another. With that said, Twitter seems to be a different breed of social network. It doesn’t fit the mould of others (with perhaps an exception also made for Instagram) and needs to hang on to its free flowing, constantly updating nature.</p><p>Twitter has been the birthplace of some of the best movements to be enabled by social media, and indeed some of the worst issues plaguing society. Both ends of this scale are caused and enabled by an always on chronological timeline. Perhaps something does need to be done, but sorting a Twitter feed by a ranking algorithm is not it. Boosting posts by popularity could potentially lead to a much worse place.</p><p>If there is one thing that Twitter users engage with is drama, and surfacing the posts that are engaged with the most is just asking for trouble. This is without mentioning that a move towards algorithmic sorting is simply not what users want. Thankfully the rollback came <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/twitter-finally-rolls-back-another-terrible-feature-in-new-speed-record">quicker than I expected</a>, but no doubt is to be followed up by a move similarly deaf to its users desires.</p><p>Algorithms, machine learning and development smarts improve numerous tech issues, but Twitter is not one of them. To kill the reverse chronological feed is to kill something at the very core of its nature. Perhaps one day, hopefully when it is not too late, Twitter will listen.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>If the last two years(ish) has taught me anything, it’s that I love working from home. I have been happier, able to get more work done and also be more engaged with home life than ever before. There are a few things I miss from working with people in person, but on the whole I love it — but I’m lonely.</p><p>I am not sure what sparked me thinking about the interaction I have, of which I do have quite a lot, but the realisation is that I have very few friends. Don’t get me wrong, I have people in my life that I care about outside my family, but I don’t have any close-knit friends like I used to when I was a kid.</p><p>I’ve given up attempting to make them too because it’s almost impossible as an adult.</p><p>I don’t even know where to start, I miss the times when my motivation to be friends was that the person lived vaguely close to me. Shared similar interests as me, or just went to the same school. Whereas now, everyone I speak to has busy lives, and we all carve very little time for just being friendly.</p><p>Unfortunately, it could be a major cause of depression. Certainly, the root cause outlined in a large portion of <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_this_could_be_why_you_re_depressed_or_anxious?language=en">Johann Hari TED talk</a> is this lack of connection I feel. Online tools, and smartphone are great, they give me at least a sense of what I am missing, but can’t replace real connection. There is no excuse not to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/reaching-out/">reach out</a> to those in your life, but nothing replaces an in-person chat, or <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/missing-a-good/">a hug</a>.</p><p>There is an inbuilt, perhaps masculine, trait I have to accept that I don’t need or won’t ever have friends. It leads to feeling further away from the people I am forced to interact with because they are in my circle, but I really want to try. I just don’t know where to start. Do all adults feel like this?</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Despite me <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/dont-let-it/">applauding myself</a>, I don’t think I have broken the cycle completely. Sure, the urge to scroll through Twitter every brief break in activity has subsided somewhat, but there is still work to do in getting my attention back. The truth is, for me to completely do as I intend scares me more than a little because I don’t know what I would have left.</p><p>I have posed myself several through experiments recently. Trying to work out what is sucking my attention away and what is a valuable resource. Twitter, for example, still offers me quite a lot of value and I like sharing things and having the odd rescission. I don’t know why I do. Logic would tell me that there is absolutely no reason for me to post half the things I do, yet I enjoy it, and sometimes logic and reason don’t win.</p><p>Instagram occupies a little less space in my life, but arguably should be held a little higher. However, the app and service are so toxic to attention span, I simply can’t use it very regularly. Of all the time sucking, manipulative apps that I still have accounts on, Instagram is the worst by a mile. Yet, I still feel like I <em>have</em> to use it. Despite me still learning, I like to call myself a photographer, but the question comes who am I a photographer for?</p><p>The fear comes from honesty. If I am completely honest with myself, and I were to go through with the things that I want to do. Such as deleting my instagram account, I am genuinely worried I wouldn’t want to take pictures any more. Which partly answers my question about whom I take them pictures for. Without the result, i.e. showing them to other people, there seems very little point.</p><p>Without question, I enjoy the process of capturing the shot, although I do hate editing because I am poor at it. So, the process does give me some satisfaction, but the result is really the reason for donging it. If it were not for Instagram, or other social media, I wouldn’t take the photo in the first place — I would just look. Meaning, I wouldn’t be <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/having-a-camera/">a photographer</a> at all.</p>

      <p>I feel the same stresses that <a href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/62008eb7dc551a002085e298/wordcel-vs-rotator-brainworms/">many people</a> seem to be experiencing at the moment. The pressure in your mind that nothing seems to fix. The inability to concentrate and the nagging idea that you might be depressed. At the point where all the issues that the previous two years brought should be subsiding, for many of us it feels worse.</p><p>Perhaps it is my <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1489232464006586371?s=20&amp;t=uw11xKn14l9ZKBMKnphCog">health issues catching up with me</a>, perhaps I am just getting old, but I can’t escape the feeling of dread. I simply don’t feel like the person I used to, as if something has been taken from me, and I am constantly searching to get it back. For weeks and months, having no clue what was missing in my life, until I stumbled <a href="https://pca.st/risrfed3">on a podcast</a> with Johann Hari and discovered <a href="https://stolenfocusbook.com">it’s my attention</a>.</p><p>During the pandemic, I have leaned on the online world to keep me going. Relying on my online friends and the ever-changing discourse to keep me entertained and engineer at least some kind of normality. For this, I am eternally grateful. Taking part in iMessage groups and Twitter rambling chats has been a godsend. Unfortunately, this has had such a detrimental effect on my mental health and general life enjoyment that it's hard to quantify it. An effect further exaggerated by my day job being constantly connected to the web.</p><p>This isn’t another downer post. I am not moaning about my impulses <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/twitter-muscle-memory/">to open Twitter</a> constantly. I am not berating the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/deactivated-twitter/">internet</a> for doing something that makes good business sense. It is more of my admittance that I understand it now. I know where the itch comes from, and it is inside me. I am craving something else. An escape, some company, or simply a distraction from something that I don’t want to do, and the apps or services created to gain your attention are always willing to give me whatever it is you need.</p><p>They, of course, will keep serving you whatever you require. Through algorithms and machine learning, pulling in manipulative design and gaming our system — they will always know what you require even if you don’t. Each time you log on the battle commences to keep your attention, but you don’t have to let it. It sounds simple, but it takes effort and understanding coming to terms that the motivation is in you.</p><p>I have too long been blaming everything else but myself for this. Only now after I have broken the cycle, I can see that the issue was with me all along. The <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/its-not-the/">internet is not at fault</a>, it has been the support network for us all. Working, interacting and playing online has got us through, but it’ hurting us to continue this reliance, don’t let it keep you down.</p>

Every single application that is outlined (none of which work in practice) is to sell you something.

Yet, I haven’t seen anything serious behind web3 apart from monetising everything.</p><p>You can scream and shout about decentralisation and freedom all you like, but the amount of grifting going on — and the excuses that are made that this is something that just happens — puts it in the same league as the dark web.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>During the past few weeks, I have bene leaning on my Apple Watch as my primary device. It has become the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-ultimate-minimalist-phone/">answer to most of my distraction problems,</a> and in many ways the most important in my life. Taking a step back and thinking about the use case for all of my devices has proven to be an interesting experiment, and I have come to some differing conclusions than those I may have done before. I truly now think it’s time to break away from the smartphone and introduce more add on devices.</p><p>When I am sat at my desk, much of the time I do not know where my phone is. Not because I am so pretentious I just don’t care, but because I don’t need to. Apple has done a remarkable job of making all of their products so integrated that often my phone goes missing for hours. Anyone texts me it pings my Mac (iMessage or not) when they call I can answer hands free or use AirPods for a little more privacy, meaning I never miss a thing.</p><p>This, of course, happens with an iPad just as seamlessly, with everything synced across devices for good measure. This isn’t perfect, but the vast majority of the time, I frequently wonder why I have a phone at all. Alas, Apple place so much emesis on the iPhone that I couldn’t do this without it acting as a relay. They seem dead set on never freeing the Apple Watch from its grasp, and perhaps they should reconsider.</p><p>Granted, to live a completely free life it may take more investment. However, I would much prefer for another device to take over as the fulcrum and make everything else add-ons. The most obvious of these would be the Apple Watch. Picture a world where this is your ‘main’ device. You can pick up and put down devices as you choose, and they can action anything you need.</p><p>Using your iPad, it becomes just like a big phone. Have a smartphone with you, then it works as it does now but when you don’t need it, you just turn it off. Require a smaller phone for the weekend away? This becomes much less hassle if your phone is a satellite device for something else.</p><p>This is without thinking about the rest of the add-on devices that could be possible, or simply work better once it breaks free. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/21/apple-completes-ar-vr-headset-production-tests/">Mixed reality and potentially virtual reality</a> devices will be launched by Apple soon, so I could envision a world where all I require is my Apple Watch and some glasses. It makes perfect sense for the ability for my Apple Watch to be everything because it’s always strapped to my wrist. It's time for it to break free and become a device in its own right and work better with everything else.</p>

Discourse seems to break down far to quickly into name calling and there is a complete intolerance to other sides of arguments. TO put things simply we don’t know how to argue correctly any more.</p><p>I’ll say it before and I will keep saying it, the most important conversations in my life, those that have taught me the most are with people that don’t think the same way as me.</p><blockquote>And then part of the problem is that so many people like everybody, often self centered.

One of the reasons that computers could be better than humans in this is that they don't have feelings.</blockquote><p>Unfortunately tech creates safe spaces to limit integration with apposing view points as little as possible. The mighty algorithm creates a feed where everyone reacts the way you do to everything. Limiting your understanding of other points of view. Becoming used to social friendships built on the back of shared interests and dedicate less and less time to those that don't behave as we think you should behave. There is no time for people that we have to make an effort to understand.</p><p>But there is no problem with this because it makes us feel great inside, we rate ourself higher because the AI understands us better and gives us the things we need. Keeps us happy, but destroys real community with it.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>This started off life as a link post to an interesting video on <a href="https://birchtree.me">Matt Birchlers</a> writing set up. However, it quickly spiralled out of control into me writing regular expressions, editing javascript and spending two days making this set up my own. If you’re into doing anything like this, then the best place to start is his excellent video below.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card">[embed]https://youtube.com/watch?v=GqTyyQBi3hA&amp;feature=oembed[/embed]</figure>
<p>I’ve been <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-obsidian-set/">using Obsidian for a while</a> and created quite a robust set-up for tasks, notes, and everything else. This lasted a while but started to fall away the longer it went on because I still had to use other apps to get things done, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/looking-for-my/">such as Ulysses</a>. The thing I have found about being consistent is to remove as much resistance as possible. Cutting down on the chance that the idea will slip away, or the task just won’t be completed. So transferring fascinating links in Obsidian and then then into a writing app or Ghost was untenable.</p>
<p>So, thanks to Matt, and a few tweaks I have found something that really works and in the process I have even moved reading apps!</p>
<h2 id="matter">Matter</h2>
<p>Despite being in the beta testers since really early on, <a href="https://hq.getmatter.app">Matter</a> never really stuck with me. I was a hardcore <a href="https://www.getupnext.com">Upnext</a> user and nothing could tear me away. That was until the team kept updating and improving things to a point I had to go back. Matter allows me to read all the articles I want, highlight them, make notes on them and then push them straight into Obsidian (and Notion too is thats your thing).</p>
<p>By installing the <a href="https://github.com/getmatterapp/obsidian-matter">Obsidian plugin</a>, all of my notes and highlights are pulled in and displayed for later reference. I use this to refer to things, link notes together, and research some topics that come up whilst digesting my reading list. To make this my own, I had to edit the javascript to display things exactly as I wanted. My biggest desire was for the highlighted quotes to appear as markdown quotes and a title at the top. Matt walks you though how he did his, my changes are made in the same place as follows.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css"># ${feedEntry.content.title}
${this._renderMetadata(feedEntry)}</code></pre>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<pre><code class="language-css"></code></pre>
<p>${annotations.map(this._renderAnnotation).join(“n”)}
<code>.trim();
  }
  _renderMetadata(feedEntry) {
    if (feedEntry.content.publication_date) {
      const publicationDate = new Date(feedEntry.content.publication_date);
      const publicationDateStr = publicationDate.toISOString().slice(0, 10);
      metadata +=</code> Published Date: ${publicationDateStr}<code>;
    }
    if (feedEntry.content.author) {
      metadata +=</code> Author: ${feedEntry.content.author.any_name}<code>;
    }
    metadata += "n";
    return metadata;
  }
  _renderAnnotation(annotation) {
    return</code> &gt; ${annotation.text}${annotation.note ? <code>
  * **Note**: ${annotation.note}</code> : “n”} `.trim(); } };</p>
<pre><code class="language-css"></code></pre>
<h2 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h2>
<p>If I decide that the quote, and my thoughts are interesting enough for a link post on my blog, then the second step is to get that into Ulysses. To achieve this, I use the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/obsidian-shortcut-launcher/">MacStories Shortcut Launcher Obsidian Plugin</a> and link this to my Link Post Apple Shortcut.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/86dfde2825.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>With thanks to Matt once agin for s<a href="https://twitter.com/mattbirchler/status/1493282183628402695?s=20&amp;t=ghaffL4AEjFm_JVu0DvTiw">haring his Shortcut with me</a>, he got me quite far down the road. Due to me messing around with the way I wanted the information to be displayed in Obsidian, his regular expressions didn’t work, so I had to customise this quite a bit.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card">
<div class="kg-bookmark-content">
<div class="kg-bookmark-title">Shortcuts</div>
<div class="kg-bookmark-description"> </div>
<div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3c1d689e3c.jpg" alt="" /></div>
</div>
</figure>
<p>This Shortcut looks for the title, URL, and Author. There’s also some customisation with the option to select the quote you wish to use and then the facility to add a different title to your post. It works on Mac and iOS; however text input is a bit finicky on macOS (as all Shortcuts seem to be). Regular expressions are the key here, so the shortcut is pretty messy and probably could be better, but the elements are as follows.</p>
<p><code>(?&lt;=Author:)(.?)(?=n)</code> does the same but with author.</p>
<p><code>^(#)s?(.+)n{1,2}</code> finds anything in the document that is H1, i.e. a title with a #.</p>
<p><code>&gt;(.*?)(?=n)</code> finds all markdown quotes in the document.</p>
<p>It is unusual for me to show more than one quote in a post as I try and pick something that sums up the whole point. Or sometimes pick up smaller sections that hit me personally but don’t necessarily reflect the whole post. If you wish to pull out all quotes then deleting the ‘select from list’ section will transfer all into Ulysses.</p>
<p>All of this is rearranged into my set-up I publish link posts in and then opened in a new Ulysses sheet. I promise not to spam everyone with loads of link posts. In fact I don’t post many of them, but this set up has already meant that I have referred back to what I have been reading a lot more. Obviously, your millage may vary.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For the last few years, I have been <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-cant-go/">looking to go back</a> to simpler times. Ones that didn’t try to hack my brain every time I open my phone. Or, in fact, a time when I didn’t need to carry a phone with me at all. Those times might be long gone, but I can’t just give up on my dream without a fight. After a bit of backwards and forwards, I think I might have found the best minimalist phone.</p><p>After experimenting with <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-smaller-phone/">older devices,</a> I felt unfulfilled and sometimes caused more hassle than they are worth. Recently, I tried a ‘dumb phone’ in the <a href="https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp02-4g-mobile-phone/">Punkt MP02</a>, which left a lot to be desired considering its £300 price tag. Couple this with the realisation that I need to be able to access some apps occasionally (How on earth do you do banking nowadays when the branches are hardly open?) – I was stuck. That was until I realised I had the best minimal device to replace my phone the whole time – my Apple Watch.</p><p>I’ve been <a href="/2015/05/17/i-like-this.html">in love with the Apple Watch</a>, particularly a <a href="/2021/10/05/a-month-without.html">cellular version</a>, for as long as I can remember. It allows me to leave my phone at home when I don’t need it but still be contactable, yet I couldn’t see its real usefulness until I took a step back. I truly think this could be the best minimalist approach to a world that seems to demand a smartphone.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/0ad9644b2f.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><h2 id="minimal">Minimal</h2><p>The screen is small and, although perfectly nice, isn’t appealing at all. Nothing about it tries to hack my brain to use it more. It just sits and does its thing without intervention until called upon. It has very few apps installed on it, most of which I can control and remove if not needed. Many services are not updating or removing their apps from the Apple Watch because they missed the point of it, but those that remain can be completely independent.</p><p>The notifications on Apple Watch are surprisingly powerful, but I did have to do a bit of work to turn many off. Apple still likes to ping you for far too many things by default – rings notifications, breathing stuff, hand-washing, and fitness all set to off. Sure you can also do this to your phone, which is recommended, but the Apple Watch just slips up a sleeve and becomes almost invisible when you don’t need it.</p><p>There's no conversation distractions, no facedown on a table dilemma, and no reason to not pay attention to the world. Much like a dumb phone, it just waits for interaction from others. Taking up very little space in the world, and much of the time you can't tell it’s there.</p><h2 id="useful">Useful</h2><p>Podcasts and music work perfectly, streaming over LTE and playing through my AirPods is a dream when out and about. Not to mention, Apple Pay still stores all of my cards and allows me to pay exactly as I would with my phone. Unfortunately, the weird looks and slight embarrassment when using your watch never subsides.</p><p>As someone who has health issues currently, the Apple Watch has really shown its usefulness. Being able to pull my phone out or share data with a healthcare professional that proves my resting heart rate, activity levels and all sorts of other indicators is wonderful. Having a device strapped to my wrist that is actually more useful in many ways has proven to be great to rid myself of other devices when I don't need them.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/ba83862d88.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><h2 id="intentional">Intentional</h2><p>With all this said, the thing I love most about adopting this approach is that it asked nothing in return. I can’t use it for much, but I can use it for everything useful. All whist not being a phone at all. Unfortunately, I still require a phone to set the Apple Watch up, but the bonus being that for those times I <em>do</em> need a more regular looking phone I have one. However, due to just how useful my Apple Watch has been, should it ever rid itself of the iOS reliance, I <em>may</em> consider not replacing my phone.</p><p>Perhaps my perfect combination would be an iPad Mini and an Apple Watch. I can't see a future where the smartphone won't dominate our lives, but I am some way to freeing myself. The Apple Watch gives me a semi-smart device when required, and the accompanying phone gives me a phone if I <em>really</em> need one. Which isn't frequently, it sits alone on my desk because <a href="/2021/10/07/i-dont-use.html">I don't use it much</a>. Even less now.</p>

      <p>Coverage from Steriogum on Neil Young pulling <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2173905/neil-young-spotify-joe-rogan-vaccine-misinformation/news/">his music from Spotify </a>:</p><blockquote>In a open letter to his management and record label, which has since been taken down, Neil Young has asked that his music be promptly removed from Spotify, citing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on the platform. “I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines – potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them,” he wrote. “Please act on this immediately today and keep me informed of the time schedule.”</blockquote><p>If we are to constantly blame social media platforms for the miss information posted to their site (and we should). Then it only stands to reason that scrutiny should fall on everyone else too.</p><p>Where are the false information flags on podcasts, or even songs? Joe Rogan gets held to account more than anyone else because he’s so popular, and controversial. However his reach could be so damaging. There is only so many times you can hold your hands up and say “well I’m a dummy what do I know” before it wears thin.</p>

The first rule of any club, doesn’t matter if its fight club or <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/goodbye-for-a-bit/">NSM club</a>, is you don’t talk about it. Breaking rule one is sacrilege and can lead to club banishment. Or in my case, people feeling bad — and I’m sorry.</p><p>I’ve had a few conversations over the last couple of weeks with people that I have talked through my choice to back away from social media and I’ve needed more words that I expected. Once you utter the words that you don’t use social media it puts anyone that does on the back foot. </p><p>Like a subtweet, or a slight of character it can feel personal. As if you’re casting aspersions towards anyone that does. Which in my case is not the case. I love sharing my thoughts and feelings on my blog, but also don’t want them to interfere with those of others.</p><p>There is no judgement here. You won’t find any big push to make you do something you don’t want to do. Whatever you choose to do with your own time is cool with me. More though needed when sharing on my part I think. </p>

Not everything has to be sold, marketed and developed to a stage where i hate it. I just want a past time that I enjoy doing and sometimes it even costs me money!

Data, attention, or just setting you up for the payment hit later on. It feels exploitive and you can small it in the air from the start. </p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>When I wake at silly times in the morning and get out of bed, I don’t even know why I put the TV on. I am not bothered about what is showing on the screen, it doesn’t light my way in the dark, I must turn the volume down so low it is impossible to hear. Yet, it’s always on because I can’t face the fact that I am staring at my gadgets.</p><p>Though it could be argued that my TV screen is nothing more than a larger one sucking my attention. An alternative to the smaller one in my hand, or the slightly less small one on my desk. It doesn’t feel as guilt ridden. If it's on, I’m not just staring at my phone, I am watching TV and happen to be using my phone at the same time. I am <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_screen">second screening</a> but not really.</p><p>When, in truth, the screen is nothing more than background noise to make myself feel a little better. Simply lit up to offer a little self assurance that I am not lost to the doom scroll or never-ending dopamine hits of red dots on my devices. That’s what other people do, not me. I might select a documentary to play while I pay little attention. Just to really prop up my ruse. Fooling myself that I am learning or consuming something worthwhile instead of doing what I don’t want to admit to myself that I am 100% doing.</p><p>The mental gymnastics my subconscious does to try to appease my ego is comforting. At least I can sit here, at 3am, safe in the knowledge that I am watching TV and perhaps learning something instead of loosing sleep to my phone. I am better than everyone else after all and deserve this background noise just to drown out the screams from my logical brain.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For years, I have imagined a future I seemingly cannot attain. One where I no longer have a need for a smartphone and don’t share my life on the internet. Perhaps I retire to a cabin in the woods. You know, that type of thing an old person raging against modern times would do. Granted, I am not old, and I have accepted <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-cant-go/">the smartphone need</a>, but what exactly would happen if I did quit the rest of it?</p><p>No one I know seems to have managed it. At least no one I hear from any more, and that’s the point, isn’t it. As Cheri points on in <a href="https://hypertext.monster/2021/07/17/no-social-media.html">No Social Media Club,</a> 30% of Americans don’t use social media at all, where are their ideas published? The only ideas I can take in are those that want to quit and either can’t (me) or don’t really want to (also me).</p><p>The fact is, I am also worried. Worried about the feelings that also disappear if I were to somehow slip out of the grasp of social media. By some chance that I lose my motivation to share my life online and interact with others, would I also share my voice? The reality is that if my motivation to share were at some point removed, so too would be my drive to write.</p><p>Would I become another person lost to the no social media club? Never talked about, unless someone occasionally remembers that person who managed to quit it all. Looked back on with the same weirdness as I remember the kids at school that didn’t have TVs at home. It didn’t matter that these families were tight-knit, much happier and actually enjoyed each other's company — the weirdos didn’t even watch the X Files!</p><p>I wasn’t around to publish before the platforms took over, and somewhere in an alternate timeline there’s a me that never started sharing things. Does he still write? I am positive my blog would die along with my interest in other peoples lives. As much as I do not write to be read, my whole blog is built around sharing thoughts and ideas to faceless people. If I don’t share with people I like, I doubt I would publish at all.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>The straw that broke the camel's back, or <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-finally-deletedfacebook/">broke my relationship with Facebook</a>, was a podcast on ghosting. I am pretty sure everyone knows what it is by now, but in essence it is the idea that you don’t want to deal with issues so you just ignore them, and by them, I mean people. I didn’t like the idea that I was cross posting to Facebook, as if I were there, but never replying to any posts. I was Ghosting.</p><p>That was more than 4 years ago now, and I don’t regret it for a second. However, I see the same social media ghosting going on all over the place. In an effort to cross posting everything everywhere there are massive holes developing and some times it’s sad to see them. I am guilty of this currently, I haven’t quite figured out what I am going to use and what I am not, so <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/cross-posting-to/">Twitter cross posting</a> can come across a bit rude. I can only apologise.</p><p>There’s a certain level of expectations from comments on social media. Sure they don’t all deserve replies, but I might be in the minority here, but it feels weird to leave the service completely. Sure, you’re not responsible for where your content gets posted, but cross posting appears just like a normal post. So, I’m a bit uncomfortable with it. On services such as micro.blog this is really obvious. It is littered with users that have signed up at some point, added their RSS feed and have not checked in for a long time.</p><p>Posts are receiving replies, asking questions and giving feedback to no avail. Many users seem under the impression these posts are by active users, which is a real shame. Twitter, Facebook and Mastodon are littered with these ghost posts. Does it matter, no, is it something I think about, of course. It’s great to be able to share your work everywhere and get more people to view it, but I like to monitor it at least a bit just so I don’t seem rude</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>To be honest, I never wanted to talk about the metaverse. An idea that has been floating around since at least the 70s that we are all going to live in VR one day. Populating a world that replicates our old one but allows us to do it somehow better. This idea only being pushed into the forefront again because Facebook wanted to take some light off its rubbish pile of a service.</p><p>Instead, insisting the company, now called Meta, was going to focus its efforts on building a metaverse for us all to live in, and this couldn’t be further from what people want if they tried. There’s no denying that technology will get to a stage where it can augment, and in many ways replace, the real one. The sad fact is we might need this if we continue to build data centres and mine cryptocurrency to buy digital crap instead of fixing the world we have. No-one want it to be built by Facebook, though.</p><p>Yet, the fundamental idea presented is flawed on so many levels, I am surprised we are still talking about it. That is without the notion that a company like Facebook is going to power such a world to begin with. I don’t want to even go there with the idea that Facebook can somehow be trusted to “bring us all together” when we are perfectly capable of doing that without a viewer strapped to our head. Let’s take a step back for a minute.</p><p>The Metaverse that Meta presented was one of replacement. A massive pitch of a rendered reality, not one that can actually be made, instead of the one we live in. Mark presented alternative ways to meet, make meetings, even shop, all in VR and the idea is laughable. No one wants to do those things. No worker in the world wants to have a meeting as it is. Spending time and money recreating something that no one wants to do, instead of finding a way to eliminating that thing, is Silicon Valley at its finest.</p><p>What's this? I can push a cart around a virtual grocery store and pick up things off a shelf? I don’t even want to do that in real life, and the technology available to us has already allowed that menial task to be eliminated. Do I even need shopping at all, unless it's for the preselected nutritional paste that is pumped directly into my system because I can’t take the mask of my face because of all the fun I am having watching digital concerts and chatting to my friends in VR?</p><p>To burrow down to the core of the issue that I have is that there is nothing new here. Nothing that makes the world a better place, and solves problems. There are, for instance, massive benefits of using VR for disabled people. Improving accessibility and making interaction easier. Nothing is solved by it, but another layer is added on top to make things as ‘normal’ as possible. There’s no pitch to this effect, though. Just privileged folk having meetings or watching a concert with a headset on that they could do in person, or with existing tools.</p><p>Add to this the very real side effect that all this energy and work being done is destroying our planet anyway, it seems like some kind of shortsighted dystopian story. A tale of solving problems that occur from the problem trying to be solved. Yet, the solution is already possible.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Have you ever heard the expression that the universe is a mirror? The idea that whatever you put out into it, gets reflected straight back at you. It seems a little absurd on the face of it. A theory akin to <a href="https://www.thesecret.tv">The Secret</a>, that you can manifest whatever you want just from your frame of mind. Yet, I think there’s something in this, you know.</p><p>Ever been in a room with someone who’s in a bad mood? You don’t need to see or hear anything, you can feel the energy in the room. The stress feels as if it is leaking out of their body and often starts to affect surrounding people. That feeling lights something in me and I often need to get out of there straight away. It makes kind of sense thought when you think about it.</p><p>All the negative stuff we put out or see every day must go somewhere. Crappy tweets, passive-aggressive comments at work, it can’t hurt to be mindful of it.</p><p>Since listening to a fairly out-there conversation with <a href="https://www.duncantrussell.com/episodes/2021/12/10/meet-delic-live-with-aubrey-marcus-johnny-pemberton-and-vince-kadlubek">Duncan Trussell and Aubrey Marcus,</a> I’ve been more concerned with the negative energy I put out. This isn’t directly anything to do with <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/goodbye-for-a-bit/">my hiatus from Twitter</a>, but there’s got to be some benefit to not seeing all that the cesspool has to offer, numerous times day. Given the fact that some people learn to express more outrage over time whilst using social media has been <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2021/08/13/likes-and-shares-teach-people-express-more-outrage-online">scientifically proven,</a> it could be manipulating us all more than we think.</p><p>As I wrote about yesterday, I know I am more predisposed to this kind of thing. I’ve seen the results for myself. From emotionally abusive and manipulative partners to down right aggressive work colleagues, they’ve all taken their toll on me in one way or another. So in a bid to do what I can to steam the flow, I’m beginning to be more mindful of the way I am and hope that this brings about a positive change in others. It already makes <em>me</em> feel better!</p>

      <p>James Tocchio on his view <a href="https://casualphotophile.com/2022/01/06/yes-the-camera-matters/">that the camera matters</a>:</p><blockquote>I’ve been missing that. All of that. And it’s really hit me this week that I’ve spent the past couple of years thinking that the camera didn’t matter anymore. But I think, maybe, that it matters more than ever.</blockquote><p>If I am honest, I’ve not yet worked out what all the words are, they seem jumbled and don’t really get to the point. Yet, the whole time reading I was thinking about my thoughts about my camera, so I guess that’s the point.</p><p>I have two, my A7c and my iPhone 13 Pro. After spending some time accepting that I need both in my life, they now serve entirely different uses for me. Neither is more important than the other, but I am glad I have both.</p><p>My smartphone needs to have a good camera to capture all of life's moments. My kids doing things I want to let others know about, or record a memory I want to look back on. Perhaps to show the world what I am up to and post a <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk">short post about it</a>. I often try to put come artistic flair on it, but more often than not they are candid, slightly blurry moments frozen in time.</p><p>My camera on the other hand is for expressing myself. Picking it up to do something, or go somewhere, I want to capture with my self-expression. Like painting a picture or making some music, this is my art. Granted I am still learning, but it's the way I want to express myself outside my blog and what I am dedicated to.</p>

      <p>There have been a few points in my life that have felt like it was ending. The specifics of these no longer matter to me, a long time ago fading into insignificance. Yet at the time, they felt like major issues that appeared insurmountable.</p><p>Of course, everything can be overcome. The feelings of major issues fade in time. Life moves forward, and the events depicted in the stories told about it evolve.</p><blockquote>It'll go from being, you know, a book of my life to becoming a chapter to a paragraph to a line to a word to a doodle - <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jason-sudeikis-august-cover-profile">Jason Sudeikis</a></blockquote><p>Not everything happens like this. There have been turning points that need to be worked through, both good and bad. They still retain the size and gravity that the moment dictates, but they still fade in time. As Jason sums up above, depending on when the book is written, all lives events shrink in importance the further you get from them. From a chapter, to a few lines, and often become next to nothing.</p><p>The rawness of emotions regularly feel overwhelming at the time. But like physical scars, they need time and space to heal. They also need to be looked after, tended to and dealt with. Ignore an issue, and it will get worse over time. Baby it, and the surrounding area will stiffen up and make matters worse. The only answer is to deal with the issue and recognise your body and its amazing ability to heal itself, in time.</p>

      <p>Colin Devroe on <a href="http://cdevroe.com/2022/01/05/bye-social-media/">Quitting Social Media</a>:</p><blockquote>Not that I can’t focus. I can sit down and get into flow on a programming project more often than not. But when I’m still, when I’m idle, when I feel like I could be bored at any moment I grab my phone and scroll through Twitter which sends my mind into overdrive on a million topics, timelines, thoughts, and emotions.<br />I don’t think this is good for the human brain. I know it isn’t good for my brain.</blockquote><p>It’s the last few words of this post that I’ve been saying for a while. I know the are are loads of positives in connecting with people, yet every time I move away I get “yeah but why”.</p><p>I know, for a fact, that when I use social media a lot I am a worse person. I waste more time, I procrastinate more and I think about things less. My desire to watch more films, play more games and also write more just doesn’t have time for scrolling through other peoples lives. My Twitter obsession started more than a decade ago and it’s time for me to take back my brain.</p><p>Yes I know I do this every so often. No it’s not going to be for a year like Colin. If Social Media is good for you, great, but the amount of push back I get is stupid. <strong>You do you.</strong></p><p>I will check in a bit, but the last few days of only being able to go on Twitter on my desktop has been really helpful for me to see things more clearly. So if a little is good, more must be better, right?</p><p>Well, we’ll see. Goodbye for a bit. Feel free to reach out in other ways if you want to. Love you all.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>After some <a href="https://maique.eu/2022/01/03/subscriptions.html">inspiration from Maique</a> I thought I would take stock of things going out of my account. I am a sucker for trying out new apps and services, often forgetting to cancel them before the free trial expires. So, I got out my bank statements and checked my subscriptions page and made some adjustments.</p><h2 id="must-haves">Must Haves</h2><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-one/">Apple One</a> - We as a familly get a ton of value out of one subscription for £29.99. 2 TB of storage for photos, Apple Music for all of us, and we use Apple Fitness quit a lot too.</p><p><a href="https://www.headspace.com">Headspace</a> - we have been subscribing as a family for about 3 years now, and the £75 a year we pay is a bargain.</p><p><a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a> - My writing app of choice, and I’ve tried them all!</p><p><a href="https://www.pocketcasts.com">Pocketcasts</a> - I want to use something that has clip sharing in, but Pocketcasts is the perfect app for me. I have built up quite a few smart playlists, and the £9.99 a year for Apple Watch streaming, and other benefits is a bargain.</p><p><a href="https://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a> - I technically don’t pay for this, the business does, but it's the lifeblood of everything I do. Expensive but so worth it.</p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/">Netflix</a> - Love it, watch loads of it for everything from documentaries to rubbish TV when I want to unwind.</p><p><a href="https://www.brain.fm">Brain FM</a> - Essential and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/brain-fm-always-playing/">my most used media app</a>. Lifetime subscriber, so I suppose doesn’t count as a cost any more.</p><p><a href="https://www.hover.com">Hover</a> - When I bought my domains and see little reason to move. No longer pay them for email services (done by iCloud) so the cost is minimal.</p><p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> - Tiny price (£10pm) for my blog and a few other bits that I run myself.</p><p><a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> - Experimenting again with sharing smaller posts here, and for the minimal price it's a good service. <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk">Built a page that looks like my blog</a> and will see how it goes.</p><h2 id="gone">Gone</h2><p><a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a> - After a few years being a faithful subscriber, Apple Passwords now provides everything I need. So, I won't be renewing at the end of this month.</p><p><a href="https://glass.photo">Glass</a> - Technically still a subscriber, but I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/glass-feelings/">don’t use the app any more</a> and won’t be renewing in September when it is due.</p><p><a href="https://www.hey.com">Hey</a> - Nothing wrong with the app and service, just don’t want to give the company any money.</p><p><a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> - Tried to get back into this recently, can’t find a use for it that I can’t do with Shortcuts.</p><p><a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> - Can’t get into this whole journalling thing and if I did I don’t think I require another app to do it in. Some people seem to love it.</p><p>I feel pretty good about the amount I have cut down in the last year or so. With more and most service being rolled out by iOS recently, I have saved a packet. So, I don’t feel so bad giving them £30 pm for Apple One.</p><p>Most if the subscriptions I do pay are family plans paid annually, so they work out much cheeper and much better value with 5 of us using it.</p>

      <p>Taking inspiration from a <a href="https://www.kvn.li/plan2022/">few other bloggers</a> posts that I have read, I thought I would post my intentions for the upcoming year. That way everything is out in the open and there is at least a little accountability in the universe. The new year is usually when I start something new, leading to it dieing around April time. This year is different.</p><p>Nothing new is planned for this year. That’s not to say that opportunities and ideas won’t arise, but I intend to double down on what I am currently doing.</p><h2 id="writing">Writing</h2><p>Posting every day in November was <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/writing-everyday-is-exhausting/">exhausting but also very beneficial</a>. My blog has broken even for the first time in years for November <em>and</em> December. I am never going to make the money out of writing that I have in the past, but getting to a stage where my traffic justifies the work I do is a fantastic feeling. All from a small Carbon advert at the top of each page and post.</p><p>I will continue to post regularly, no numbers, no targets, just solid output whenever inspiration strikes. I have moulded my workflow into a great place, filed with Shortcuts and publishing prompts that I <em>know</em> I can continue at a good pace. Due to my increased output I like to think my writing has improved, and I know my style — which is half the battle with writing.</p><p>I have a few posts lined up for other publications in the works, so I hope that this will bring a bit more exposure to my blog and open up other avenues for creative work.</p><h2 id="other-skills">Other Skills</h2><p>Learning new skills recently to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-new-home/">build my new blog</a> and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-to-use-tailwind-with-your-ghost-blog/">take on new challenges</a> has been enjoyable. Having <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2021/12/24/micro-alto.html">ported a new theme to micro.blog</a> I have plans in the works to do some more, as well as produce my own theme for Ghost.</p><p>This year will be one of less wasted time on social media and more learning new things to expand my skills. I hope that this again will open up more areas for creative work and allow me to progress my career.</p><h2 id="other-areas">Other Areas</h2><p>After the usual discussions with family on New Year's Eve, we have all outlined what we want to work on this year. Mine is one of improving my social side in person and make more connections. I struggle a lot with in person socialising and lean far too heavily on social media to provide the needed conversation. How I do this is something as yet to be finalised, but no doubt will involve pushing myself a long way out my comfort zone.</p><p>I have also highlighted my desire to play more games, watch more films and also read more books. With that comes to an end, my eclectic range of things to do in 2022. My overall theme is “more of the same”, worry less and enjoy more.</p>

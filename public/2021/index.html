     <p>A friend Of mine, <a href="https://gabz.blog">Gabz</a> has been going backwards and forwards on where to host his blog. He tried Ghost for a bit, but went back to micro.blog mainly because of a feature he likes called “on this day”. Much like some features on social media, it surfaces posts from the current date one year ago, meaning you can see what you were posting. This gave me pause for thought.</p><p>Not on his blog, it's wonderful, but the desire to look back. It is human nature to lean on our memories. They made sure we didn’t go to the dangerous places, knew what a predator looked like, and allowed us to flourish as a species. Learning and growing from our memories is a fundamental building block of success in every area of life. Yet, I am not convinced we need to do so much of it now.</p><p>Due to digital technology, almost every area of our memories are being offloaded to the web. Each image permanent, each post saved and in some cases brought back to life every so often. I take photos of my kids and life things all the time, yet have a mentality to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/shot-with-meaning/">hardly ever look back</a>. My personality is fixated on living in the present and looking forward — but some people find looking back important.</p><p>I get a lot of benefit of offloading my mental load to other means. Even this blog is my place to think out loud and work though my thoughts to conclusion. Linking back to old posts that have supporting ideas or often changes in attitude are essential for my personal improvement. Clearly there is a massive benefit to looking at the improvements that have happened and the journey you have made through life, I am just not convinced it needs to be so fixed.</p><p>Don’t our memories need to be a bit fluffy and malleable? Would life be better if we didn’t remember so much. Just the bits and pieces we need to, in a way that suits us. Can growing and learning still happen if we can’t move away from mistakes and events that have happened?</p><p>These are all questions I have not answered yet. I am sure there will be a time when I will be thankful that my past self took so many pictures of life events. They might be the only thing to stir the memories from their sleeping place in my brain. My interest is how different we as people can be when it comes to our memories and the things we value most.</p>

     <p>I am not the type of person to be influenced by other people's thoughts, but they often prompt thoughts of my own. Lots of <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/photography-needs-to-be-fun/">talk about Glass</a> from people I follow has led me to think about my usage, and it’s complicated to some them all up.</p><p>The simple one is I love using it. The app design is beautiful. An uninterrupted feed of great photos with a well-thought-out UI. Finding people to follow is pretty easy now that categories feature heavily. Meaning my feed to full of both the types of images I like to look at and those of the few friends I have that use Glass.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/5a7f3dcf37.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>Granted, the standard of photography feels a bit intimidating. Glass is definitely where a lot of pro level shooters share their shots. Some very skilled individuals simultaneously give me imposter syndrome and teach me lots about the pictures they take. Glass can be very inspiring in terms of the type of shots that look good and the settings to be able to capture them.</p><p>With all that said, I’m losing the motivation to check it. If it wasn’t for the wonderful widget, I think I would have deleted the app by now. Trends in photography absolutely exist, but I see lots of the same type of images. All shown in the same way, and often whole sets of images posted one after the other in a ‘dump’ that floods my timeline for a long while. However, I can put up with all this, frankly I put up with a lot bigger issues by using Instagram — but posting in multiple places is untenable.</p><p>No one I know apart from nerds on the internet uses Glass, and that is unlikely to change. I don’t need Glass as a portfolio of sorts, so I think it has reached its usefulness lifespan. The novelty has worn off for many people I follow, leading me to question my usage. As nice as the app is, and as great as the team behind it are, my interest in using something so niche is coming to an end.</p>

     <p>Some would say we have an unhealthy relationship with our phones. That for many it is a digital attachment to our hands, ever present in a world that increasingly encourages it. Others would argue it’s a revolution, allowing us to be more connected to each other and have more information at our fingertips than ever before. We all sit somewhere on the spectrum between those two extremes, but I find it essential to try to establish where you are, and where you want to be.</p><p>Personally, I have a weird relationship with mine. I don’t like to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-dont-use-my-phone-much/">use it much</a>, but I am stuck in a world, a job, and an interest group that needs one. Having come to the realisation that I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-cant-go/">can’t get rid of it</a>, I like to push it to the extremity. Or at least that is the story I like to tell myself.</p><p>I don’t like to use my phone, but I do. Going through periods of addiction, then realisation, before I return to sporadic use. The reasons for this are varied. I am unquestionably being manipulated by the apps and services I use, but all of this <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/its-not-the/">lays at my door</a>. The reality is that I love using my phone, it allows me to interact with more people, get more stuff done and generally be more social than I would be in person. However, using it makes me a worse person. I don’t sleep as much, I am distracted, and I hate what <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/needing-feedback/">it does to my brain</a>. So, I ask myself this question, often whist staring at the slab of metal and glass in my hand. What is my smartphone for?</p><p>What does it achieve? Which tasks couldn’t be achieved without it? What can I do easier? There are numerous answers to these questions, but focusing on them is important. Using the tool for the purpose you bought it for in the first place and not sliding down the hole is all about self-control. Being able to know what job your phone <em>is</em> doing, and what it is doing <em>to</em> you.</p><p>Everyone’s answer to those questions will be different. I need my phone to keep in contact with people I don’t see in person. For taking photos of my kids to save. To share my thoughts and ideas with the world. I don’t need it for scrolling through Reddit at 2am. Or for tweeting random stuff instead of interacting with people that are around me. However, for others this will be different, and some of those things will be true, but knowing this is half the battle.</p>

     <p>In early 2020 I was dismissive. Stuck with the majority of the country that scoffed at the thought that some flu couldn’t be anything more than media hype. It had happened before, and although we’d had a few scares with other viruses, it was easy to write it off.</p><p>The first step was being sent home from work, nothing more than a little holiday. I’d wanted to work from home for ages anyway. Then people started dying. A few at first and then a lot more. My wife and I sat opened mouthed as the prime minister ordered us all to stay home. A moment I will never forget for as long as I live.</p><p>All of my energy now went into keeping everyone safe. Not me, there is every chance that our family would be fine. We are all young, no medical conditions that would make catching COVID-19 dangerous. Everyone else that would be at risk was our concern. Our elderly family, those with medical issues, neighbours, and friends that needed our help — that was our focus.</p><p>We stayed home. Walked once a day with our dog. Stood on our doorsteps and clapped those putting themselves at risk to help others. My wife went back to work to help the adults she looked after, our family did its best to complete school work, work for our employers and keep everyone safe. Not for us, for everyone who required us to help.</p><p>We dedicated days, then weeks, then months of our lives to make sure those at risk got the best chance possible. Cancelling everything that would put others at risk. Holidays, birthdays, seeing family, all of that fell away. Replaced by video calls and huge group chats. Just to keep us going. Our mental health suffered, we isolated when we had to, we spent weeks not going out because doing so put <em>others</em> at risk. We looked after everyone by looking after ourselves.</p><p>The chance of making it back to normal came quicker than expected. Medical treatments meant that the chance of dying reduced. Care packages enabled people to survive, the waves of patients in hospitals declined in their intensity. Vaccinations came and allowed us to see a light at the end of the tunnel. Compared to what we had been through, the exchange of a few hours feeling sick in return for help with immunity was like a golden ticket out.</p><p>We saw what those suffering had been through. We lost neighbours, friends, family. We heard from people that survived, some still suffering. Thankfull that there was a way out, a medical marvel. Not perfect, but it gave us a chance.</p><p>The sacrifice was, of course, worth it. I suffered, and in many ways I still am. My family still bares the scars of staying in, some that won’t heal for a long time. Mentally exhausted from the effort to save others. None of these sacrifices are for us. Hardship in life rarely is, but to be a good person is to think of others. Help as many as you can and improve the lives of others when you can. Yet, in 2021 these values seem lost.</p><p>Lost to a world dedicated to the individual. Lives filled with selfishness and greed. Where they are all the main character and care very little for others around them. Instead of making this obvious sacrifice for the health and well-being of others, concentration is on themselves. We all did what we needed to do to get through this and are being held back by the few. We didn’t put ourselves through this for us, we did it for you.</p><p>You could at least help.</p>

     <p>Matt Birchler on his need for <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/photography-needs-to-be-fun/">photography to be fun</a>:</p><blockquote>Additionally, since Glass is paid and artists generally like people to be able to see their work, it doesn’t make sense for really talented people to post there (certainly not only there) because it’s limiting who and enjoy (and maybe purchase) their work.</blockquote><p>Although this post talks more about Matts waining use of Glass, this little part towards the end stuck out to me. Echoing my thoughts about posting photos to Glass.</p><p>I wish I could just quit instagram, and Glass is precisely the sort of place I would quit it for. Although if I did, no-one I actually know would see my photos, so I have no choice but to post to Instagram as well. I am not bothered about building a following or anything, but the average Joe people are never going to use Glass. Then comes the obvious realisation that if I might as well <em>just</em> post to instagram.</p><p>So, here I am, loving at app, enjoying the photos posted, but still posting to Instagram.</p>

     <p>Despite many years of taking photos, I have only visited a camera shop twice. Once to sell all my gear and another to purchase <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/having-a-camera/">a new camera</a>. It was the second visit that really stuck with me. It opened my eyes to the fact that the things you use should ‘fit you’ in more ways than one, and it’s how I look at the world now.</p><p>I intended to buy a new A7iii. It was the camera I had previously, it was in my price range and ticked all my use case boxes. Yet, the helpful chap in the shop made me try almost every camera in that price range and see what they felt like. To paraphrase his words:</p><blockquote>The camera needs to fit you. In your hand <em>and</em> in your person. Does it do what you need it to do, or are you changing things because of what it can do?</blockquote><p>The A7C I left with fits in my hand so much better than anything else. It has features that I value, like an articulating screen, and is the camera that ticked the most boxes. Yet, the one I absolutely wouldn’t have bought had I not gone to a camera shop. I would have leaned on all the reviews that exclaimed how this camera was pointless, or only useful for travel.</p><p>This isn’t a pitch for a specific camera, either. I get a lot <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1470451209865736201?s=20">of stick online</a>, and in person for my choice of “tiny phone”. Of course this is all tongue in cheek (I think) but this plays into the same feelings I had <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-pro-default/">when new MacBooks launched</a>. I bought the phone that fit me best, and I am starting to think I might have small hands.</p><p>For these two things that I handle the most, it's important to me that they feel right. Indeed, they feature the things that I want, but if they are uncomfortable to use or something doesn’t feel right, I won’t use them. More significant than the specs or features, is the feel of a device, the ergonomics of use and its ability to work with you. You shouldn’t be changing your life or your use case to fit a device, it should fit you.</p>

     <p>I am not even sure how I stumbled on Brain FM, but I have been using it for years. Stumping up for a lifetime subscription (no longer available) a while ago due to its ability to providing me with awesome background audio to my daily life. When I say that, I really mean it because it is nearly always playing through my headphones.</p>
<p>Loads of services aim to provide constant looping audio as a means of filling silence. The rise of playlists and services such as Lofi has opened up a larger market to studying music and the like, but Brain FM goes further. They use AI and human composers to reduce distraction and improve behaviour. If that sounds a bit far-fetched, all of these claims are backed by <a href="https://www.brain.fm/science?gclid=Cj0KCQiAqvaNBhDLARIsAH1Pq53ZpyKPFoUQyzpIHAXblyGYq25iTfEIYDUUGywTJ4Dw80N2T00AcxIaAm-dEALw_wcB">scientific research</a>. Using fancy words like “Neural Phase Locking” and “functional music”. I can’t possibly comment on the validity of these claims, but in my subjective experience it does something to me that means I can get more done.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9a47fb03a3.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>For the past few months, I have dedicated my time to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/going-deeper/">working in a deeper state</a>, and Brain FM has proved invaluable to achieving the most I can. My favourite by far is at the top of the app home screen. Ninety minutes deep work is the peak period to get stuff done but not burn myself out. So, I sink into this state a couple of times away. Especially when I am in the office, my Bose QC35s are on, connected to my iPhone, and I am in concentration mode.</p>
<p>The looping relaxing music soon disappears to a point where I am not listening, but the audio undoubtedly helps me shut out the world and concentrate on the task at hand. Replacing the need for me to half concentrate on a podcast or worry about what music to listen to.</p>
<p>Brain FM is also filled full of white noise options, meditation audio and what seems like unlimited options for music. So, there’s no messing around deciding what to listen to. If you want to check out some preview of the app and see if it’s the kind of thing that will help you concentrate, there are some clips available on YouTube.</p></br>

     <p>There is a theological perspective called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps">god of the gaps</a>”. This idea is that whenever humans are exposed to something they don’t understand, they fill it with a notion that they have already accepted. At many times in history, that was with gods and mythology. As so, all the gaps humans had in their knowledge were explained away easily.</p><p>This is not to say <em>the</em> god, but <em>a</em> god was always responsible for everything that appeared outside our control. In more modern times the gaps that we didn’t understand, the stars, the tides, the very makeup of our being all being explained by science. Which can be a belief system in itself, but as great as science is, it doesn’t replace everything. Unfortunately, these gaps that still exist, even when sometimes explanations <em>are</em> available, are being replaced by conspiracy theory.</p><p>While gaps in scientific knowledge are <a href="https://biologos.org/common-questions/are-gaps-in-scientific-knowledge-evidence-for-god/">certainly still being used</a> to justify a belief system, when it comes to gaps linked to more social problems, the gaps is often filled with ‘alternative theory’. That’s not to say that some conspiracy theories don’t eventually come to have merit — perhaps this is why they have become so attractive to those seeking to understand things that can’t be explained away. This of course is part of the issue.</p><p>I love to understand as much as I can. Yet at some point I have to realise that I cannot become an expert on everything and put trust in people that do. After studying scientific method, but not being a scientist, for numerous years, I like to rely on my hidden bullshit detector. So, I use both my knowledge and a high level of suspicion to fill the gaps in my knowledge whenever I come up against them. Without letting one source tell me the way, more taking a broad overview of information and letting it point the rough direction.</p><p>Although, for some. A similar approach may be true. However, with their underlying desire for everything to be explained, and all responsibility removed, leads to belief in stories. We can blame social media for increasing it (undoubtably true) but the thirst to understand is one we all share. Which makes these beliefs somewhat understandable as away to bring understanding to an ever-changing and impossible to understand world, now my worry is that <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/are-we-addicted/">we are addicted to it</a>.</p>

I’ve <a href="https://glass.photo/gr36/4JJ4fSSeWT7TxuTnKMnvmw">taken it before with my camera</a>, but there is something about the Christmas lights I see when walking my dog in the evening that fills me with joy.

We couldn’t afford loads of presents, I wanted a Mega Drive one year, but my mum could only afford a Master system, but we always spent loads of time together. Always at my Grandmas house and always doing the same things as clockwork.</p><p>I went from a small child not really wanting to be sat at a table eating food or playing with my toys on the floor to an adult helping to lay the table and joining in the conversation. Until my Grandfather passed away, and my Grandma became too frail to host us all and the mantle passed to me for a few years. In 2021, it will be just us four now, Team Morris.</p><p>We have built our own traditions, things we do every year, and made the day ours. The reason I love the lights so much is that it tells me how far I have come, grown older, but never lost the focus on the things that really matter. Spoiling our kids with things they want, but still stuffing ourselves to completion.</p>

     <p>Matt Birchler tweeted and wrote about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a> recently. I have no idea what prompted the post, but I hope to god it wasn’t me. On looking at the graph posted I realised that I am very susceptible to this and there is a very specific point on it just for me. I am calling this the ‘Morris Point’ because it's caused me so many issues in my life, so I’m claiming it as my own.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/e6f48e2ad8.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>When you first start doing something new, or learning about a new subject, the curve at which you take in new things is steep. Leading to overconfidence and often a very high chance you will make a fool of yourself. I love these periods, where you’re obsessed with everything about the new things and learning lots, but with no experience to back up your opinions.</p><p>As time goes on, this lapses, and your tendency to have confidence in your skills starts to wane. With me, this gets to a certain point, and crashes like a stone. This is the Morris point, typically one of no return. I start to question why I am doing this, if I am good enough to carry on, and often give up completely. With little encouragement, the easy way out is to quit.</p><blockquote>Never stop doing your best just because someone doesn’t give you credit - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXMHhh6Irks/">Dan Green</a></blockquote><p>The curve at the bottom looks insurmountable on the way down. The time you put in impossible to achieve, and the imposter syndrome hits hard. Only sheer determination and a bit of luck gets you through this point and on the way up again. It doesn’t matter what it is, YouTube, podcasts, newsletters. They all bit the dust because that’s the easy way out at the bottom of this curve. I am only still writing through sheer force of will, and I have nothing better to do!</p><p>A <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/do-i-like-likes/">few likes</a>, some feedback, a positive word or two, all help when you’re at the bottom and trying to get up again. I guess you have to bear with the gobby overconfidence for a bit to see if something better comes out the other end, or if they just give up trying. Doesn’t hurt to know your limits though — and watch out for the Morris point. It’s a killer.</p>

     <p>I’ve never been a fan of prime lenses. Although they are a staple of almost all photographers I admire, their fixed nature has never appealed. I viewed them as being too restrictive, whereas a good zoom lens can get me a wider range of shots by adding on a little more weight.</p><p>Yet, every beginners photography guide I read or watched told me to get a good prime and learn to “walk with my feet”. Which is their way to tell you to look for the shot and how to position yourself instead of planting your feet and zooming around. You earn the shot much more, and potentially improve your eye for shooting.</p><p>So, I gave it a go. Shopping around for a while and settling on a really nice <a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/camera-lenses/sel85f18">85mm f/1.8 Sony Lens</a> for a great price. It's a little over the 28-70mm that I usually shoot with, so I hoped the extra range would prove useful in future. As soon as it arrived, I fixed it to my A7c and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/newark-nottinghamshire/">went for a walk</a>.</p><p>The whole experience was strange to start with. I was fixed into one way of shooting with no room to move. I had to work a lot harder than I anticipated, but the shots I did get were very different from my normal ones. By restricting the way I could shoot, I changed the way I looked at things. Gone are the small details and tight focus images, replaced by photos that I think contain a lot more information than before.</p><p>I found myself looking for stories to tell. Buildings on the river, shadows of the unusually bright December sun, architecture details that would be easy to miss. They are not perfect because I missed numerous things due to depth of focus (I simply wasn't used to having an f/1.8 lens) but I am happy that I decided to limit myself. I would have shot similar images but missed all the surrounding elements to them by zooming in.</p><p>I would have been too focused on the details instead of the bigger picture, which is a lesson for life, I guess.</p>

Today was different, I did the whole photographers things and took my camera out to see what I could find.</p><p>Thankfully I got some <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/newark-nottinghamshire/">great photos</a> and learnt a lot about street photography (settings and the like), but one interaction made me cut my visit very short.</p><p>When I was waiting for a car to move to get a shot I wanted, somebody was hovering around me. Something just seemed off, he walked towards me, stopped and then just began to act weird. He was taking photos of a random shop (nothing very interesting about it) on his phone and sneaking a peak my way every so often.</p><p>I decided to leave the shot and walk away because he made me feel uneasy having my camera out. Thankfully, I have an A7c with a 85mm prime attached, so I can fit it in my coat inside pocket. Once he has gone, I stopped to take <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/size/w1600/2021/12/DSC01314.jpg">another shot</a>, and another man approached me (you can see him sat in this photo). He began to ask about my “gold camera” (it’s silver) and how nice it looked. Which is cool, I am all up for getting people interested in cameras, but then he started asking me how much it was worth and if I had insurance.</p><p>At this point, I asked him to have a good day and got the hell out of there. They both just made me feel uneasy, so I trusted my gut.</p><p>I hope this doesn’t often happen and is just bad luck on my first time out.</p>

     <p>Andy Nicolaides on the <a href="https://thedent.net/very-for-good/">outlook of some tech commentators</a>:</p><blockquote>For many millions of people out there, VR could, and already can to a certain extent, open their lives to opportunities they can’t currently enjoy and experience. We’ve all heard the laughs and sniggers about watching a concert with people virtually but for so many people, VR may finally give them a chance to experience something many others of us would take for granted. The argument for and against VR and a meta verse is always so black and white, but the world is rarely so easy.</blockquote><p>I tried really hard to not open with a social media trope but — so much, this!</p><p>I am sick and tired of people that have an important voice and an influential following making these kinds of takes. Most of these boil down to “If it doesn’t work for me, it’s stupid”. Granted, I didn’t listen to the whole show, just the clip Andy posted, as I stopped to listen to this show a long time ago because of these hot takes. So, I may be missing some kind of grand explorer or inside joke, but I doubt it.</p><p>The fact that <em>still</em> people can’t think outside their box is frankly ridiculous. VR is 100% never going to be for me, and I laugh more than a little at the way Meta pitch it to users, but much like Facebook itself, I can’t still see why some people would use it.</p><p>I am not sure if this is just playing to the audience, as this ‘sad VR looser’ rhetoric is a tired joke at this point. Making comments along the link of “don’t you go outside” or “don’t you have friends” misses an entire section of the population that can’t. <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/missing-the-accessibility/">Missing the accessibility angle</a> (this post is from three years ago about Connected doing the same thing) is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age.</p><p>VR is <a href="https://abilitynet.org.uk/news-blogs/8-ways-virtual-reality-could-transform-lives-disabled-people">already helping people</a> access parts of life that you take for granted and the fact you can’t even be bothered to look into this make me think much less of you.</p>

     <p>After going <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-glass-half-full/">backwards</a> and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/refill-my-glass/">forwards</a> (as normal) with the photo sharing service <a href="https://glass.photo">Glass</a>, I am enjoying using it lots. I post the best images I take to it. Although I can’t hold a candle to some of its skilled user base, it scratches my photo social media itch and teaches me quite a bit about the images people shoot.</p><p>Right from the off, the founders spoke about their desire to avoid the expected social app norms. You won’t find follower counts, like buttons or, my favourite, an algorithmic feed. Although, it feels <a href="https://twitter.com/ljpuk/status/1469025288470286342?s=20">to some</a> as if they have rolled back their choice with the <a href="https://glass.photo/highlights/appreciations-are-here">implementation of an “Appreciate” button</a>. It’s not like it seems.</p><p>Extending my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/do-i-like-likes/">previous thoughts around social media likes</a>, particularly on images, leads to looking at how to use the function positively. I was <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/i-think-glass-should-add-likes/">not alone</a> in thinking that Glass <em>could</em> work in a way of giving small feedback prompts but not ruin the service completely. I had some ideas, but the team at Glass have absolutely nailed it. Although at first glance it looks like a dangerous slope, no public counts and no algorithm to game means much less attention-seeking rewards.</p><p>Even the word they use, appreciate, is a perfect fit for what I want to say about a photo. Even “I like it” is not enough occasionally. One of my favourite things about micro.blog is that people would respond to posts with “thank you for sharing” which makes no judgement or response, just an appreciation of taking the time to post it. A perfect fit for Glass. I am thankful that people pay £25 a year to show me the shots they are proud of.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/d28d5f9d5e.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>As with everything, It’s not completely harmless, but I think it’s a good compromise. Take the image above. I was pleased with it and couldn’t wait to get it edited and posted. Only to receive absolutely no feedback. Is it rubbish? It is just not what people want to see? I have no idea because it just sits there on Glass for people to see. My reward is getting the shot I wanted and the process of producing the result — but not everyone is like that.</p><p>Of course, <em>I</em> don’t care. Others may do, but I feel as if the users that would care have other apps better suited to their interests. My takeaway from the update (I’ve been able to use it for a couple of weeks now) is almost all positive. Being able to leave a small token of appreciation will replace the hundreds of times I write “great shot” or “love this” and means the comments I do leave have more thought in them.</p>

     <p>There is no getting around the fact that creating things consistently is hard work. It doesn’t matter what it is, making videos, writing blog posts, painting, crafts, it all takes time and effort to keep going. Particularly if you need inspiration to spark the content in the first place, something that comes in waves for me. The biggest thing that help to write more, is to read more.</p><p>Full disclosure, this post was inspired by similar thoughts and guidance from Matt Birchler on his <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/how-i-read-more-write-more-and-think-more/">content creation cycle</a>. If anyone is to be listened to, it’s Matt, cause his constant stream of videos and blog posts are unbelievable. However, I have shared some guidance on <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-reading-flow/">my reading</a> and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-writing-workflow/">writing flows</a> previously to try to help.</p><p>This time I am going to concentrate on how I read things and how I then go from inspiration to publication. This will outline what apps I use, how I like to do and where I do to. Posting this hopefully will give you an insight into my creative process and perhaps help you start writing more too.</p><h2 id="rss-triage">RSS &amp; Triage</h2><p>The internet is full of awesome stuff. So much so, it can be impossible to keep up with it and take nothing away but. A feeling of being overwhelmed. To combat this, you must remove any completionism you have. No one has the time to read and watch everything. So triaging the inputs you like is critical, and I do this mainly through RSS.</p><p>Using my favourite app, <a href="https://reederapp.com">Reeder</a>, I have loads of feeds set up to put in content from all over the web. I can then easily look at things being published on my iPhone or my Mac and fill a few moments. I hardly ever read anything in reeder unless it is a really short post, I give scything a quick scan and do one of two things.</p><ul><li>If it looks interesting, I will share it to <a href="https://www.getupnext.com">Upnext</a>.</li><li>If it doesn’t, I will move on.</li></ul><p>If I ever get to the point of feeling like there is too much to process through, I just mark all as read and move on. As compelling as things are on the web, nothing is vitally important, and good posts have a habit of popping up again anyway.</p><p>I do this a little with Apple News too, but it is filled with far too much crud to filter through very well, despite <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-to-restrict/">limiting what is shows</a>.</p><h2 id="reading-highlighting">Reading &amp; Highlighting</h2><p>I read everything in an app that I can highlight and share these with <a href="https://readwise.io">Readwise</a>. This is absolute detrimental to me because I want to be able to read and retain the things that I highlight as fascinating. At the moment I am using Upnext for this, but I have also used Pocket in the past, as well and small dalliances with <a href="https://hq.getmatter.app">Matter</a>.</p><p>All of my Newsletters are also delivered into Upnext, so I can highlight them as if they were web articles. Pro-tip, you can also get around some paywalled articles by saving them to relater services, but not all.</p><p>I open Upnext on my iPhone whenever I feel like it. Small instances of downtime in the day, as boredom relief, and then in larger periods at night on my iPad Mini. I don’t read every word of every article, nor do I highlight loads of things, but I adore reading and learning new things.</p><p>At any point if I highlight something really thought-provoking I will share it straight into Ulysses where I have <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-writing-kanban/">a writing Kanban</a> set up. This is the start of all of my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/tag/link/">link posts</a> and many of my articles.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/f902eb95bb.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><h2 id="listening-thinking">Listening &amp; Thinking</h2><p>There are four smaller areas that fall in here, all of which are important to my creative process. Upnext has the ability for me to listen to some articles, so when driving I sometimes consume these to fill the boredom.</p><p>I can’t go one without talking about podcasts, either. Although my listing has <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/podcasts-and-me/">dropped dramatically</a> over the last couple of years, there are a few shops I never miss and listen to these at work or when walking the dog. If anything in these episodes sparks some inspiration, I have a shortcut set up to type a few words into my Ulysses inbox. I have <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/add-information-to-notion-with-shortcuts/">also done this with Notion</a> in the past.</p><p>The third part of listening is being open and taking in feedback. There are many times I have written a post, spoken to someone about it, and then written again because my viewpoint has shifted. There is nothing wrong with this, and it is important to listen to feedback and take it in creatively. It also leads to some of the best conversations I have ever had about interesting topics. Be open.</p><p>Lastly, before anything gets published, you need to think about it. Just sit (or walk) and stew over the words you want to say and make sure they are correct. Establishing your true feelings and not rage publishing is something crucial, but it is even more critical to give yourself time to think about the things you consume. Just be alone with your thoughts and process everything.</p><h2 id="writing-publishing">Writing &amp; Publishing</h2><p>Every single word I publish comes from <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a>, I am writing in it now. Having <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/looking-for-my/">messed around with so many apps</a> and wasted a considerable amount of money, I always come back. For the small price it is an outstanding app, providing a great experience to create everything from a short link post to a full on novel.</p><p>The corrections available in the app seem to catch almost all of my spelling and grammar issues littered through every post, and it actually makes me a better writer. It doesn’t matter where you publish your work from here, but the most critical thing is that you do it. I do it mobile from my iPhone, but I do prefer to sit in the chair and type away. It gives me a better environment to think about what I am writing and establish what I am <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/something-to-say/">trying to say</a>.</p><p>There are no rules to writing, despite some believing so, and even less to blogging so publish away. Read more, write more and let’s converse more about the things we enjoy. That tweet you just threw into the ether, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-value-of/">should have been a blog post</a>.</p>

     <p>Exactly two years ago, I was <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/intentional-barriers/">thinking about barriers</a>. At the time it was to do with comments on my blog (I was moving it yet again) but this time it’s in my life. Although they are different topics, they both cover the same area. The intentional design of a barrier to restrict access to something.</p><p>Not entirely, just ruin the flow enough to trigger some thought or increase the motivation needed to complete the task. It is a pretty easy thing to do. Behaviour = Motivation x Ability x Prompt. The holy grail of those designing to keep you engaged and manipulate you to do desirable things. Whereas there are sometimes we need the opposite.</p><p>Take using my phone for instance. I know using it too much is bad for me, and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/a-smaller-phone/">intentionally bought a smaller one</a> to put up a barrier to usage. Although I now <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-dont-use-my-phone-much/">don’t use my phone very much</a>, there are days when I do. I get engrossed in something or am particularly bored, and I think to myself “I need a bigger screen”. When in fact I, as a person, don’t need a bigger phone at all. I know these things are internal, it’s <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/its-not-the/">not the internets fault</a>, but a bigger phone <em>will</em> make me use it more. As such, I put up an international barrier.</p><p>I’d love <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/back-as-far-as-i-can/">to go back</a>, but the reality is I require these things in place. In the same way someone who wants to lose weight might hide the sweet treats, I am putting my weakness behind as much of a hurdle as I can. Believe it or not, this is hard for me to do. I spend my life trying to make customers be able to do what they need to do as easy as possible. I want to roll this mindset out to everything, but being able to realise that barriers can be a good thing makes for better living.</p>

     <p>There are so many things in my life that cause me to think about for far too long. I dwell on things that shouldn’t take me as much time as I do, and then make others based on sheer gut instinct alone.

I am also well aware that in fact I should delete <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gr36m/">my Instagram account</a> entirely, but that is just never going to happen. I like people seeing my stuff, and my friends only seem to use apps developed by Meta. I like the little hit of dopamine that I get from a few likes every now and again. The answer to make me a better person is obvious, but sometimes despite knowing this, another option is also valid.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/68392d4c1f.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>Instead, I’ll spread my photos around the internet like confetti and see what sticks. Waste my time doing all the things when I know what the ‘correct’ thing to do is — for me, at least. This expands into a lot of my life, I can never decide on <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-iphone-line/">which phone to get</a> despite knowing which one I shouldn’t. I know I should <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/twitter-muscle-memory/">really cut Twitter</a> out of my life, but I don’t want to. I am sure there is some psychoanalytic name for it and some deep-rooted reason for this indecision, but at this point in my life I just don’t care any longer.</p><p>There are of course some things I know I have to do for the better that overcome this barrier. Eating well, meditating and exercising to name a few, that will never fall away despite me having a million and one reason to stop. But for everything else, I will continue to give myself a hard time about it, and that’s OK. I think.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Never one to be left behind, I am continually looking for a way to speed up my theme development. Call it desire to be cutting edge, or near of missing out, whatever it is I love to play around with it. One thing that gets loads of attention is Tailwind CSS, so naturally this was on my list to play around with.</p>
<p>They call it “A utility-first CSS framework” but what it actually means is you can style all of your classes right in the HTML. There are pros and cons with this, but here’s how to get it working on your Ghost Blog.</p>
<h2 id="before-you-start">Before You start</h2>
<p>Fair warning this requires a bit of command line work, and if you’re not comfortable with this back away now! You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A computer running a desktop OS (macOS, Linux, or Windows)</li>
<li>A supported version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> (at the time of writing this is 12.x, 14.x or 16.x)</li>
<li><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#alternatives-tab">Yarn</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm">npm</a> installed</li>
<li>A folder to do all your work in</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="install-ghost-locally">Install Ghost Locally</h2>
<p>First, start with Ghost CIL. In the command line:</p>
<p><code>npm install ghost-cli@latest -g</code></p>
<p>Now CD into your empty directory and run:</p>
<p><code>ghost install local</code></p>
<p>This will get ghost up and running locally on your machine, most errors are communicated daily well, but for extras do <code>ghost help</code>.</p>
<p>If everything looks OK you’ll have a site at <code>http://localhost:2368/ghost</code>. For more information on what this means, check out the <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/">Ghost docs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="your-theme">Your Theme</h2>
<p>This next part is up to you, either install a theme you want to use Tailwind with, or start developing your own using the <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Starter">Ghost Starter</a>. You will need to put your theme files into your Ghost local install folder, <code>content/themes</code>. If you want to clone a theme from GitHub, or your theme is stored on GitHub (<a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-to-edit-your-ghost-theme-using-github/">you should be!</a>) CD into this folder and use:</p>
<p><code>git clone git@github.com:&lt;your-github-username/.git name-of-theme</code></p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/948bdc03a8.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="install-dependencies">Install Dependencies</h2>
<p>Your theme more than likely will use Yarn, the Ghost Starter linked above is the best example. Use Arm to install everything needed by Tailwind. In your theme folder, use <code>yarn add tailwindcss</code> and then add in the necessarily files <code>npx tailwindcss init</code>.</p>
<h3 id="gitignor-file">Gitignor File</h3>
<p>Unless you want more than 5,00 new files committing to your repo, you’ll need a robust gitignor file. Most themes have these set up already to no commit files such as DS_Store on Mac, so make sure you add in <code>node_modules</code> to your file.</p>
<h3 id="import-css">Import CSS</h3>
<p>In <code>/assets/css/screen.css</code> add in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
</code></pre>
<p>This imports the tailwind classes to your main CSS. This may partly replace some of your CSS to the Tailwind classes, so something such as typography may change on your theme.</p>
<h3 id="gulpfilejs">Gulpfile.js</h3>
<p>Add in the following to your <code>gulpfile.js</code>.</p>
<p>1 - Under <code>// gulp plugins and utils</code> put in <code>const tailwind = require(‘tailwindcss’)</code></p>
<p>Under <code>function css(done)</code> there will be a section for <code>postcss(</code> add in <code>tailwind(),</code> so it will look something like the following.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">function css(done) {
 pump([
 src(‘assets/css/screen.css’, {sourcemaps: true}),
 postcss([
 easyimport,
 autoprefixer(),
 cssnano(),
 tailwind(),
 ]),
 dest(‘assets/built/’, {sourcemaps: ‘.’}),
 livereload()
 ], handleError(done));
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="restart-all-the-things">Restart All The Things</h3>
<p>Now that everything is completed, restart Ghost with <code>ghost restart</code> to make sure everything is being cached correctly. You should be good to go now and can get cracking with adding in new styling. When doing this, you will need to CD into your theme folder and run <code>yarn dev</code> to build the correct CSS.</p>
<p>You can also try out some themes that already have Tailwind built into them such as <a href="https://github.com/tailwindtoolbox/Ghostwind">Ghostwind</a> or <a href="https://www.origintheme.co">Origin</a> but I am enjoying working new classes into my website. For more information on using Tailwind, see their <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs">documentation</a>.</p>

     <p>I wasn't going to write anything today. When driving home after work, I had decided against it because I've had a busy week so far and just wanted to relax and watch football. Arriving home, I soon discovered we had no internet and no TV. Our provider, Virgin Media, were having issues, and we were one of thousands affected by the outage.</p><p>No big deal. At least for me, my son likes to watch a bit of gaming YouTube before dinner and Lucie loves her Cocomelon, but it's not the end of the world. It's not like we don't enjoy each other's company or anything. Best to double-check the service status and see what's going on. That's when I strayed into <a href="https://twitter.com/virginmedia/status/1466436681624698887?s=20">the worst Twitter</a> thread I have seen in a while.</p><p>Scrolling through, it's hard to work out if the whole thing is some kind of joke I am not in on. Stinking to high heaven of entitlement, all because of an issue that means they can't watch TV. No one is really put out, but don't you dare take away their telly programmes! I haven’t seen anything quite like it, and Twitter is a pretty crappy place. The replies and entitlement would be annoying if it wasn't so hysterical.</p><p>The thing is, that could be any of us. We live in one of the best times in history. With long lives to live. Well, if this damn virus stops trying to kill us, with very few <em>real</em> problems. Most of us live in nice warm homes with internet access (well how else are you reading this) and live a life of true privilege.</p><p>It’s dead easy to take all this for granted. Letting your <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/letting-your-ego/">ego run amok</a>. Leading you to act as if the whole world owes you something. It is a constant risk. Taking a step back and looking at the much bigger picture is important every time something like this crops up. It’s much better for you to think though things fully because scrubbing those entitled tweets from the internet might be harder than you think.</p>

     <p>For as long as my daughter Lucie has been with us, my sleep has been disturbed. The first weeks of broken slumber that are supposed to gradually reduce are still with us 11 years later. Her <a href="/2020/01/31/the-diagnosis-relief.html">genetic condition</a> means she suffers with several disabilities, but also seems to have the superpower of needing very little rest.</p><p>The nights and early morning I am awake are a burden. One I <em>must</em> carry for life, with no solution available (seriously, we have tried everything). Dependably, I am awake on average 5 nights from 7 at 3 or <a href="h/2016/12/27/oh-hello-am.html">4 am</a>, sometimes much easier. Where most people suffer from sleep deprivation because of their choices, be it screen addiction or fixation on hustling, I would love to sleep more.</p><p>The weird thing is, on the occasional days Lucie does sleep until a reasonable time, I miss it. Not the headaches or the chronic tiredness, but the extra time. The early morning runs and the work completed at silly times of the night are a giant bonus. When I only have a ‘normal’ number of hours to use up, I run out of them far too quickly.</p><p>How on earth are we supposed to fit all this in. In 24 hours we need to sleep for 8, are expected to work for at least 8, leaving only 8 left. Just 8 short hours to do all the things that we need to do. Eating, washing, dressing, housework, commuting, and you know actually do things we enjoy. The modern world is broken, and it is no wonder <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6473877/">lack of sleep is such an epidemic</a>.</p><p>I am in a much better place if I just steal a few hours of sleep and use them for something else. Of course, my health isn’t it's literally killing me, but my enjoyment improves. The world is a much quieter place at 4 am, and I love it.</p>

     <p>Joshua Ginter’s <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2021/11/29/thoughts-on-writing-each-and-every-day/">thoughts on publishing every day</a>:</p><blockquote>There are nights where you just want to veg and play video games rather than throwing something together for the blog. There are times when you don’t have a fully formed opinion and you sort of puke it out into existence. Or you create filler pieces to get through a few days.</blockquote><p>This whole piece covers some of the thoughts that have been floating around in my head since publishing more often. I thought about posting something similar later on this week but Josh does this far more eloquently than I would. So I thought I might as well throw some of my own words behind his.</p><p>When I first set my goal to publish every weekday for a month I had <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-writing-kanban/">loads to go at</a>. Ideas were flowing and at one point I had 4 days worth of posts ready to go. This gave me some runway to slow down a little and let thoughts arrive, and of course, they arrived less and less as the days went by. So as I got closer to days where nothing was sat in my ideas tray I began to feel the pressure. Rather than writing when I <a href="/2021/11/19/something-to-say.html">had something to say</a>, I wrote because I had to say something.</p><p>Some posts I am proud of, some not so much, but I have learnt a lot along with way. My practice of writing every day is years old at this point (most of my words are just for me) but it helps me get ideas straight in my mind. Writing blog posts is no different. I often start with a small idea, pull on that thread and it evolves into something new, and often interesting.</p><p>I love thinking about things and blogging is me doing that in public. It gets tiring giving yourself pressures and goals, so I <em>will</em> slow down, but I still want to keep the momentum going somewhat as I love doing it.</p>

     <p>If you’re a bit sad like me, one of the most interesting features of iOS 15 is <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212608">Focus Mode</a>. Bringing some much-needed updates to do not disturb that went before it, and also making your phone much more customisable in different situations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is a first-gen product if ever I have seen one. Being overly confusing, and actually a bit complicated to understand. My biggest help in diving in to this was Matt Birchler’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZCx-9wF3ow">excellent walk through video</a>. This allowed me to get mine set up in three different scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="home">Home</h2>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b559029247.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>This set up was the easiest to implement as it represents pretty much where my phone was in ‘normal’ mode. Taking the regular set-up screens and making all the apps I have installed available. What Focus mode allows me to do now is remove the use of my work email app, and also make work people not able to contact me outside work time.</p>
<p>Now I am even less tempted to check me email, and also any rogue calls or text that creep through sometimes on days off are no loner an issue. This did take a lot of tweaking over a few days to get the contacts right, it would be great to see Apple do a bit of work on this, but it’s a good starting point.</p>
<p>Automation features allow me to switch this on effortlessly. I am in ‘Home’ whenever I finish working hours (early morning/evening) and all weekends.</p>
<h2 id="do-not-disturb">Do Not Disturb</h2>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d810ce1322.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>The best mode! Very similar to the DND I had set up previously but even more powerful. I have all apps restricted and only a very select few people can contact me (close family).</p>
<p>Due to being able to use different home screens at different times, I have put in a nice dark wall paper and made my screen empty using a fake black icon with <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/home-screen-icon-creator-a-shortcut-to-create-custom-icons-for-apps-contacts-solid-colors-and-more/">MacStories Icon Creator Shortcut</a>. This mode is active at night and whenever I am in meetings using Smart Activation.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ed89a77de4.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Any other time I am not home, I am working, so it needs it own mode. This mode removes all needless distractions and helps me <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/going-deeper/">work deeper</a>. Bringing my task list and flagged emails in front of my face at every opportunity.</p>
<p>I love the location automation here that turns this on whenever I arrive at my office. Unfortunately, it doesn’t turn off if I leave, meaning that I had to use the ‘Home mode” switching at times outside working hours. I feel like I could go further with this set up, but it is fitting in very well and removing quite a bit of distraction from my day.</p>
<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>
<p>My biggest take way from doing this is the surprising realisation on how unapproachable this feature is. It is both the best and worst new featured added in iOS 15. Due to this overly complicated UX, I would wager that most people won’t even try to understand it, which is a real shame. Outside this, there are a few things I would like to see.</p>
<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<p>The first being implementing lists of contacts. It gets quite messy having to add in all the people who can notify you. Adding in custom lists would help no end, or simply being able to select a few contacts that cannot contact you rather than having to add in everyone else.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d50d6992c3.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h3 id="icons">Icons</h3>
<p>The icons on the Home Screen bug me more than a little, as they also display on my Apple Watch. Being able to add in restrictions to the ‘normal mode’ would help with this. There is no way to have a mode for every other situation, but also add in restrictions to apps and contacts.</p>
<h3 id="syncing">Syncing</h3>
<p>I love the way that this feature syncs across devices, but it’s all or nothing. Adding in selective sync or perhaps even a feature to only display notification on some devices and not others would be a massive improvement. I don’t mind being tapped on my watch, or something silently appearing on my phone screen at work, but don’t want it popping up on my Mac.</p>
<p>If this post prompts you to dive in and get something set up, then I would love you to share it with me. I think I can go further with this, but it took me so long to understand the feature and then set it up, I am reluctant to fiddle too much. Don’t let that put you off though, give it a go and see if you can improve your phone.</p>

     <p>During one of our many meandering chats, my wife and I were talking about her phone. She’s using <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/rutland-water/">an iPhone 11</a> and although there is nothing wrong with it, the phone has seen better days and the battery is not what it should be. We were discussing if she wanted to upgrade to something better, and her response is something well worth thinking about.</p><p>Her approach was, “I’ve never gone to do something and not been able to do it, or had an issue that a new phone would solve”. As with many things <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/be-happy-it/">we talk about</a>, this gave me lots to think about. How many times have I purchased tech on the promise of it helping me do something that I’ve never even thought about doing.</p><p>This can’t just be me. A brand promises me that “feature x allows me to y” and I am all in without even thinking. The fact that I have never even tried to do <em>Y</em> means that maybe I don’t need this new thing after all.</p><p>Undoubtedly, there are exceptions to this. New features that enable users to do even more can be valuable editions. However, that is seldom the case for me. I look at other lenses for <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/having-a-camera/">my camera</a> and think, oh that smaller f/stop will mean I can shoot in even darker conditions, or with even better separation. When in the truth is a lens with a larger aperture has never stopped me getting the shot I want.</p><p>Buying a new phone every year is my biggest weakness. I tell myself that the upgrades are worth it. That the things I value get better, and then proceed to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/shot-with-meaning/">never look at my photos</a> and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-dont-use-my-phone-much/">don’t use my phone enough</a> to actually make it worthwhile. Sure enough, I have never gone to do something with my phone and not been able to. A new phone might do some things better, but what am I <em>actually</em> missing out on? Not much.</p>

     <p>Arthur C Brooks brings the fire to make you understand that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/11/how-stop-caring-what-other-people-think-you/620670/">No One Cares</a></p><blockquote>If I wouldn’t invite someone into my house, I shouldn’t let them into my head.</blockquote><p>I highlighted far too much of this article to share, the quotable things just kept coming. So I had to go back and read it again, just to make sure I got the real feel of the words on the page, and found it quite revealing.</p><p>To discover something that Marcus Aurelius observed almost 2,000 years ago that applies perfectly to todays worries is quite shocking to me. “We all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own,” should be a waring post on social media. Why worry about what others are thinking when you should really be worrying about yourself?</p><p>Because it feels very personal when we feel socially harmed, even if that is only perceived. Our brains are made for &lt; 150 person groups of gatherers, not thousands of people online so it&#039;s important to remember that there is no need to worry about what others think, because in actual fact they don&#039;t care.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Many years ago, I think my blog was on Medium, I wrote a post with the same title. It has been lost to digital rot, but my thoughts are the same as they were. The importance of feeling and touching things in a world filled full of apps and devices can’t be forgotten. There is nothing that comes close. Holding books in your hand, turning the pages of a magazine, the process of picking up and examining a purchase before deciding is just impossible to beat.</p><p>The argument against this of course is a kind of sudo minimalism. Not having to put up with ‘things’ is often a much better solution. Who wants loads of book lying around that you are not going to read again? What on earth do you do with used up notebooks or journals? If a digital service can replace these things, and remove the hassle of them hanging around once spent, then it could be a much better solution for some. In today's modern world there is an app for everything, but I can’t feel anything about a bit of code.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I love my Kindle. Well, I love an E-Reader, I hate that the best solution is a Kindle. It allows me to read several books at once and carry around something so small and light I barely know it’s there. Yet, I never feel the <a href="https://twitter.com/GlennF/status/1438029391120924678?s=20">bookiness</a> that my heart desires. With a physical copy of someone's words, I feel like I own it, rather than renting it from Amazon until my devices breaks. Using digital services in many situations make sense, but an E-Book never feels like I am reading a book. It feels like I am staring at another screen.</p><p>For the risk of sounding a bit out there, and picking things that the modern world seems to have lost its love for, the same must be said for writing. Journaling, or note-taking, is one of my favourite things to do. I just love scribbling things down, even in my terrible scrawl it feels fantastic. I can make the case for digital journals to a certain extent because they offer something more secure and easy to keep, but holding a pen and feeling it scratch on paper makes my heart sing.</p><p>All the algorithms and cleverness in the world from things like <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-obsidian-set/">Obsidian</a> can't replace me writing things down and forgetting about them later. Reading an incredible page turner of a novel doesn't feel the same swiping on a screen. I don’t buy books, of course, only a few reman from purchasing them in days gone by. Journals and notebooks no longer litter my house, replaced by apps and services because they just make more sense in the modern world — but that doesn’t mean I can’t yearn for something more tactile.</p>

     <p>When I got my first big break in my working life, it was for a giant corporation with a robust training regime. If you’ve never had the miss fortune of having to jump through these hoops, consider yourself lucky. Whilst they are mainly built sincerely, and at least instil in your staff base the same basic level of competency, they often suck.</p><p>Sales training was the worst. Someone, I presume years ago, had read far too many psychology books and put together a plan you <em>could not</em> deviate from. They handed out a massive dossier to learn that boiled down to “if the customer says X, you say Y” in as many situations they could come up with. So, I learnt it, went on my way and tried as hard as I could to regurgitate the manual as frequently as I could.</p><p>I had no choice in this, secret shoppers were another dirty trick of this company, so you felt like a robot at all times. Let me tell you, I sucked. I sold next to nothing and struggled so much I felt like quitting. Until one day I was so fed up with feeling like this I decided I was going to leave, so I talked to every customer ‘normally’ and my sales took off.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, after months of spouting the lines some of them still come out, but they felt more natural because I was taking to people as myself, not just going through the company motions. People stopped looking at me like I was trying to sell them something, and they bought something from me instead.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/2244afb207.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>I realised at that point that my problem was that I was not being true to myself. I didn’t believe in what the company was telling me to say, and that is straightforward to spot from the outside. You can’t fake it until you make it if you’re not even sure you want to — and this applies to so much else.</p><p>As I wrote about <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/something-to-say/">a few days ago</a>, I didn’t really want to make technology videos, I went through the motions and made some because I thought that's what I was supposed to do. They sucked. I expanded from writing and talking about technology into another field that I have seen others do without actually wanting to. I went through the motions without thinking about what I was doing, as if I were following instruction on “how to build a brand”.</p><p>How many other things in life do we go through the motions without our heart being in it. The results of which will be nowhere near those that result from proper motivation. These sorts of ill-fitting ideas are preached in far too many mediums to those looking to get rich or build something. I have lost count of the times I have seen headlines similar to “Follow these easy steps, and you too can be as rich as me” or “check out the morning routine of this billionaire”.</p><p>The idea being that massive results are as easy as going through these steps. There are sometimes you have to buckle down and go through the motions, but very few where you should expect a net positive result.</p>

     <p>There is nothing more annoying that technology not working the way it should do, without any fix. Well, maybe there is, but this is me we’re talking about, and I’m pretty neurotic about these types of issues. I have been battling being able to <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1463063190238027782?s=20">log in to third-party Twitter clients</a> for ages and have finally stumbled on a fix.</p>
<p>This will also address some issues with using Twitter to sign in on other services. Some users have issues not from a third party client but simply sharing to Twitter from elsewhere. The error in question has no code, no help, but lots of hassle. When trying to log in to Twitter, it displays “Nothing to see here”.</p>
<p>Upon some <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/twitter-login-fail-shown-nothing-to-see-here/158809">cursory Googling,</a> it seems that only iOS users suffer from these issues. Perhaps Android just handles these things better, let’s be honest, iOS can be user hostile when it comes to many web things. Solving them sometimes a puzzle in comparison to more user-friendly solves from Google.</p>
<p>The answer thankfully seems to be simple, if impossible to find, so here you are following my guide.</p>
<h2 id="option-one">Option One</h2>
<p>The first thing to try, and the one with the least aggravation, is to try your email instead of your username. Seems to sort out some issues, but failed to be the answer to my prayers. This is the fix that most third-party apps suggest, along with turning off two-factor authentication, signing in and then turning it back on again. Give it a go first.</p>

<h2 id="option-two">Option Two</h2>
<p>You’re going to have to purge all the Twitter web information from your device. This is the likely culprit and unfortunately, when compared to macOS or literally any other operating system, it is all or nothing. There is no option to only clear Twitter related data.</p>
<p>Head into your setting, go to Safari, and tap on ‘Clear history and website data’. This should resolve the “Nothing To See Here” appearing after putting in your login details. Allowing you to log in to a new app or authorise a secondary service.</p>

     <p>Whilst looking at options to add a ‘tip’ service to my blog, I looked at what felt like a never-ending stream of them. There are no shortage of options, ranging from full on monthly subscriptions, to occasional buy me a coffee type platforms. I <a href="https://ko-fi.com/gregmorris">went for the latter</a> to see if I can monetise the work I do with my ‘How To’ posts. I found reading the marketing copy on these websites really eye-opening, and it started me thinking about monetisation of the content I make.</p><p>One such website <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com">Buy Me A Coffee</a> has the tag line ”A supporter is worth a thousand followers”.

I have been trying to get something back, if only to cover the costs of hosting, for almost a decade with very little success.</p><p>As I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/asking-giving-and/">wrote at the start of this year,</a> “The web is much different now than even that brief time ago”. It is still a little hard to accept that the number of people making a living from writing on the web is so small when compared to a few years ago. A few dedicated supporters well outweigh, in terms of revenue, thousands upon thousands of page views.</p><p>I am still overwhelmed when people read my posts, even more so when people give me feedback, and amazed that anyone ever felt enough motivation to donate to me. I value all of these people equally. The anonymous readers that never say a word, read the advice they need from a post and then leave. My followers on Twitter that occasionally like and retweet my nonsense. Or the people that I have met online that I now consider friends.</p><p>Sure, it would be nice to motivate more people <a href="https://ko-fi.com/gregmorris">to support me</a>, but that is not why I do it. I am already a success because that <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/what-does-success-look-like/">looks very different to me</a> in comparison to whom these tip services are primarily aimed at — but supporters do help!</p>

     <p>For those of you not following me on Twitter (and why not <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1461374261491384330?s=20">I’m hilarious</a>) I bought an Xbox Series X. I’m not a big gamer by any stretch, but having <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/love-stadia/">played Stadia</a> for quite a while I thought it was time to branch out on some hardware, and I am so glad I did.</p><p>Those of us that have busy lives or just generally kids and partners that need attention, know the realisation you don’t really have time to play games any more. Many people's modern lives are not conductive to playing for long periods of time, and as such we often miss out completely. There are some thoughts on games getting much shorter to complete, but the average game still takes <a href="https://www.looper.com/297615/how-long-would-it-take-to-beat-every-video-game/">more than 25 hours</a> to polish off.</p><p>If you’ve been nodding along and thinking the same as I, let me introduce you to the wonderful world of <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/hardware-network/power/learn-about-power-modes">instant on</a>. Available on both new Xbox versions (and I think the PS5) it removes a major sticking point of gaming for me. With instant on there are no credits to watch, no introductions to get through and very little loading at all. You can be in a game within seconds, and it’s glorious.</p><p>Sure, instant on might be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/how-the-xboxs-default-instant-on-feature-could-harm-the-environment/">killing the planet</a> a little faster, so I guess my gushing should taper a little. However, the fact that I can grab a small slice of time to myself in between everything else I have to do has been brilliant. I can leave races midway through on Forza when duty calls or go and do something between matches in Fifa, all without having to worry my game is paused somewhere — which was my solution before.</p><p>I am never going to be able to sit down and game for long periods of time, but the small 20 or 30 minutes here and there mean I might actually play some games again. The small hump of motivation to actually switch the Xbox on and not have to update GB worth downloads nor watch credits might just save my sanity a little. Praise MS for Instant On.</p>

     <p>I recently came to the realisation that I seldom look at the photos on my phone. For years I always wanted the best possible camera to capture every single moment of my kids growing up. It was part of me, and something I enjoyed doing, yet I <em>never</em> look at them.</p><p>I am sure one day I will be glad I do all this clicking. Don’t get me wrong, I am a long way from <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/life-through-a/">living life through a lens</a>, but I like to capture everything. They might come in handy when age catches up with me and I rely on all of these captured memories to spark the ones in my mind. Until then, they sit waiting for a possible future where I am old but still own a smartphone.</p><p>Despite hardly looking at them, they still mean a lot to me. They are simple family snaps. Some adorn our walls, displaying the family times we enjoy so much. I can look at a simple photo and feel all the things that I felt at the time and be instantly transported. They fill this strange place where they are priceless to me, yet are images that if anyone else looked at them would be worthless.</p><p>They are not a sum of their parts. They don’t contain world-class composition and expertly exposed colours (all things I fuss over in my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/">other photos</a>) because they don’t need to. These photos capture a snapshot of a time that will never exist again, and in it trap all kinds of emotions. Not only that, but they tell stories of what we were up to at that point, the things we did and how far things have changed.</p><p>Despite this realisation, I will continue to snap loads of digital memories. Still buy iCloud storage and better camera phones every year because I know I am building value. They mean everything to me.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Since <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/migrating-from-wordpress/">first trying Ghost</a>, one of the best things about editing my theme is the ability to host on Github. Through a simple integration I can easily edit my theme to make changes from almost anywhere. If you want to do this too, this guide should help you out.</p>
<h2 id="ghost-integration">Ghost Integration</h2>
<p>First set up the Github integration on your Ghost install, this provides you with an API Key that you will need when using Github. Head to the settings cog at the bottom of you control panel and click on Integrations.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e0d0564529.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Create a new integration and give it a name. On the next screen make a note of the Admin API URL and the Admin API Key. Please keep these private as these allow access to your blog content.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bc80373cc6.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="github-set-up">Github Set Up</h2>
<p>Secondly you will need to host all of your themes files on Github. Make a private repo, give it a name that represents your theme and head to settings &gt; secrets. Click ‘New repository secret’ and set up <code>GHOST_ADMIN_API_URL</code> and <code>GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY</code> with the integration details you set up earlier.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/87fe123509.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="796" /></figure>
<p>Once you have done this upload all of your theme files to the repo and commit them. The last step is to create a new file in your repo <code>.github/workflows/main.yml</code>. This file needs to contain the following.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">name: Deploy Theme
on:
 push:
 branches:
 - master
 - main
jobs:
 deploy:
 runs-on: ubuntu–18.04
 steps:
 - uses: actions/checkout@master
 - uses: TryGhost/action-deploy-theme@v1.4.1
 with:
 api-key: ${{ secrets.GHOST_ADMIN_API_KEY }}
</code></pre>
<p>This theme will now show up in your design settings, however you will need to make a change to you theme to trigger this. Adding in some text to your readme file is the easiest way.</p>
<p>You can now make changes to your theme through whatever way is easiest for you. I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>, but on iPad I found the best app is <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a>. Every time you push a change GitHub will build your site and them push these to your live site, this usually takes less than a minute.</p>

     <p>Josh Ginger <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2021/11/20/the-honeymoon-phase/">on honeymoon phases with new devices</a>:</p><blockquote>By then, it’ll all be too late.<br />But at least it’ll be true.</blockquote><p>It’s as if Josh had been reading my mind. The rate of publishing and the things being published has been a big theme of my thoughts of late. I’m not worried about being the first or the best, but I like to write <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/something-to-say/">things that mean something</a>.</p><p>I got pretty good at telling what devices were going to be useful when reviewing numerous phones. Sure, I still got caught up in the excitement, but devices like the Galaxy S21 Ultra and the Galaxy Fold 3 I could tell within a day or so if they made any difference to me. But of course, I had to handle a lot of tech to do this.</p><p>If anything I am the reverse now, I dismiss things and then when I actually read or watch reviews I start to see where they could benefit my workflow.</p><p>With all this said, I always try to take in reviews after time with the device. I have lost count of the number of videos reviews I watch claiming the device is the best thing ever, only to have another on a few weeks later on why they are returning it. Some of this is of course YouTubers being YouTubers, but the honeymoon period feelings are strong and should be considered.</p>

     <p>I am very dismissive of publishing my thoughts on many topics tech related. More so about devices and news that I am very late on. I figure that most people have already read or watched what they need to from the real tech people. Ones that get the product first or find something new and published the first article.</p><p>I am not the only one that feels like this, and it’s not just technology. Game reviews are also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/10/12/video-game-reviews-bad-system/">considered broken</a> by many because smaller reviewers stand little to no chance of being heard when the review things weeks after bigger sites. I have spent years fighting the negative feeling of my hard work ending up getting very little attention. These thoughts very often make me wonder if to bother at all and I see this in many others.</p><blockquote>You don’t write because you want to say something, you write because you have something to say.“ by F. Scott Fitzgerald.</blockquote><p>Except I do. We all should. If we have something to say, that should be said (written, painted, acted, whatever medium you choose), do it. If you have thoughts that you <em>want</em> to express, just because others have similar thoughts doesn’t make them any less valid. I don’t publish because I want to publish things, I do it because I have something that I want to publish.</p><p>It’s an easy mistake to make. I made some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh8W4NIk9kL_l8YEAd5KIDQ">technology review videos</a> in years gone by because I just wanted to make technology videos. I didn’t have something to say really, I just wanted to be a “YouTuber” like others I look up to. Don’t get me wrong, I think they came out OK, and I continue to make videos currently — but it was for the wrong reasons and quietly died out.</p><p>Feeling these feelings of not being heard is not unusual, but if you have something to say, say it — but don’t say it just because you simply want to talk.</p>

     <p>I don’t usually frequent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy</a>, but I stray into it sometimes just to see what crazy is going on in the world. Like macabre entertainment that makes me feel a little better about myself. Gone are Bigfoot and aliens, replaced with COVID-19 vaccination fear and politicians being pedophiles, with the occasional randomness thrown in. One <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qu8div/its_weird_that_we_have_to_buy_new_phones_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">such post</a> caught my eye that discussed the need to have modern devices to just view webpages, and it has a point.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong. The thoughts are muddled, the technology knowledge very thin — but like a child with a stick, they hit the point somewhere along the road. The web is a mess. Full of tracking, adverts and complex things that all need to load. Sure, they may look nice when viewing them with a good connection and a nice device, but if you don’t, the web can suck.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can find fantastic articles online. I hope to one day write such a post. But I find it increasingly difficult to consume these. The internet, as it's built today, is a bad experience to consume long-form content. I much rather read a 300 pages book than a 3000-word article.</p>— Kevin Wammer (@cliophate) <a href="https://twitter.com/cliophate/status/1460164332835287041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2021</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>Consuming content often means you have to put up with some of the worst websites. Ones that suck all the life out of the web, consuming resources and slowing down the load time down to a crawl. Not to mention the acceptable practice of popping things up in front of your face, most of them not properly optimised. The result of all this is often a terrible experience, and users have a habit of blaming the hardware in their hands.</p><p>Kevin Wammer went on from the tweet above to talk about this a few days ago. The fact that I often have to save an article to a read later service (<a href="https://www.getupnext.com">Upnext is wonderful</a>) is a testament to how broken everything really is. Instead of building the best possible experience for users, much of the web is made for the most gain possible. It might be displaying adverts, it might be putting up a paywall, or it might just be for attention. It all boils down to personal gain and nothing more. Greed broke the web and it may never recover.</p>

     <p>In what seems like another life, I spent a few years working for massive corporations. You know the type. Thousands of employees with several layers of bureaucracy yet you only actually speak to a handful of them. Communication was stale and cold, filtered through HR and marketing teams before it hit your inbox. There was no emotion in them, no story telling and very little actual communication.</p><p>You learnt to de-cdoe the words in to their actual meanings. Read between the lines and work out what was actually being said. Far too much energy had to go towards the interpretation of the false words and how best to action them. Unfortunately, in this dog-eat-dog world, in many situations this meant working out how to protect yourself. The burning realisation that at any moment the company could change the way they do things, and you could be surplus to requirements leads to constant paranoia.</p><blockquote>Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon's razor</a></blockquote><p>This wasn’t all bad, I suppose. I did develop a pretty thick skin as well as becoming pretty good at reading people. Now, in my calmer days, working in a job I love to bits, I have come to realise that worrying about what other people think is a fool's game. Trying to second guess things, and read between the lines in most situations gives you nothing but a headache and paranoid delusions. My approach to the actions of others now follows Hanlon’s razor above.</p><p>Once you adopt this viewpoint, it’s surprising how a large portion of what you may have previously worried about is just the stupidity of others. When the reality is that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/11/how-stop-caring-what-other-people-think-you/620670/">no one really cares about you</a>, or puts as much though into you as you do towards them. Having a <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-scout-mindset/">scout mindset</a> and giving people the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise is the best way to be.</p>

     <p>I’ve been having a bit of a bad time currently. A few issues in my professional life coupled with being extremely busy has lead to me not being my usual self. Simmering in my grumpiness last night sat on my own and all I can hear is squeak, squeak, squeak. Looking over at my dog going to town chewing on his favourite toy. Ripping it to shreds and wagging his tail like the crazy dog he is. He’s in his element. Captivated by something so simple and experiencing pure bliss, and I want to know where my chew toy is.</p><p>I’d love to go back to a time when I valued something so highly that it was able to remove me from the world entirely. Captivate my attention and keep me entertained in a euphoric state for as long as I let it. I remember the times when a new colouring book would do this to me. Leave me oblivious to the world around me while I gave the blank pages a colourful facelift whilst sticking my tongue out. I don’t think the things around me have changed all that much, but I certainly have.</p><p>It’s not the things that put us in this state, it’s our ability to surrender to them. To let ourselves enjoy something with 100% of our being. Ever tried one of those adult colouring books? A perfect activity for a little while, and then your brain reminds you about all the adult things you should be doing instead and pops the little bubble of delight you had going. It is hard being an adult in a world that has so many demands on us, but that doesn’t mean we can’t get a chew toy every now and again, does it.</p><p>So, I sat looking at this happy little boy, ripping up his favourite toy and having the time of his life. All I could do is smile, laugh and soak in the second hand enjoyment. I instantly started to feel better because Charlie taught me something. To let go every once in a while and not dwell on things you can’t do anything about. Just enjoy your chew toy.</p>

     <p>I used to be OK with email. Even in my day job I didn’t get much of it, I was one for picking the phone up and talking to people instead. My relationship wasn’t all roses, but it was certainly maintainable. Then something changed. During the pandemic, email shifted. Evolving into something else entirely, and I wonder where it’s going.</p><p>When shops were closed, businesses slowed to a crawl and our internal communication not yet ready for the word of Slack channels, my inbox began to explode. Every company wanted my attention, had new offers for me to explore, and of course all the conversations we had in person went somewhere else.</p><blockquote>Email used to be a place where you had conversations, but as conversations have moved to text and DMs, it’s increasingly become a place where you store receipts, arrange appointments, collect announcements, and now, receive newsletters. — <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/11/03/we-havent-reached-peak-newsletter-not-by-a-long-shot-519207">Jack Shafer</a></blockquote><p>If we want to look at why this is the case, of course I asked for these emails. I said yes, it was OK for my bank to keep me updated about their new products. Agreed that the company that I bought flowers from 3 months ago could let me know when my next anniversary is, but I didn’t expect this. What was once the electronic version of posting a note to a friend is now <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/08/why-stores-send-you-so-many-emails-spam/619670/">a battleground for my attention,</a> and also where I get my news.</p><p>That is because almost all of my favourite journalism is now delivered into my inbox. Personalised and funded by me from the writers that I love (<a href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/617ed0db788a020020bcc60c/hey-its-galaxy-brain-2-0/">Galaxy Brain</a> is seriously the best). Newsletters were the biggest tech boom of 2020, and I love it, but looking at this objectively, how can these two things exist side by side in my inbox. The solution may be to use something like Hey, the service I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/hey-whats-wrong-with-your-email/">was obsessed with for a hot minute</a>. It lets me separate everything out, but I am not convinced that’s good enough.</p><p>None of us want email to be this complicated. Granted, I can unsubscribe from as much stuff as possible, but I do like the occasional sale email and tempting bargain waved in front of my face. I can’t give up on well times emails <a href="https://www.equinox24.co.uk">about events</a> I want to enter again this year and reminders for birthdays. I shouldn’t have to choose between what goes where because email now hates me. This is without even talking about corporate email.</p><p>The relentless things keep popping into Outlook all day, every day, trying their damn hardest to <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/going-deeper/">distract me from getting things done</a>. Gone are the days I can leave the app minimised on my desktop because some time recently we seem to have all unconsciously agreed that email must be answered straight away. Nothing comes after work email either. You can all move to Slack or Teams as much as you like, but that just means you’ve got two things to check now because no one stops sending damn emails! All. The. Time.</p><p>I can’t figure out what email is now. It’s a weird mixture of first class journalism and marketing neediness. I can deal with Social Media wanting my attention, what I can’t deal with is losing the most important communication channel I have outside of actual human contact. Help.</p>

     <p>Casey Newton noticing Facebooks <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/all-the-most-popular-posts-on-facebook">plagiarism problem</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook’s report details the top 20 most widely viewed posts on the network over the past three months. One of the posts was deleted before Facebook published it. Of the remaining 19, though, only four appear to have been original. The remaining 15 had been published in at least one other place first, and were then re-uploaded to Facebook, sometimes with small changes.</blockquote><p>It’s interesting to think about where people post things and in what order. Instagram Reels is clearly full of TikTok made videos that are redistributed. Which doesn’t seem to matter because they can monetise it anyway, and the same can be said for Facebook itself.</p><p>When the odd breakout personality does exist on Facebook, sure they can make money, but the content has to be <em>very</em> niche. The biggest touted success such as ‘Ladbaby’. Content is <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/inside-ladbabys-jaw-dropping-net-23875864">typical of the people that still use Facebook</a>. Just take a scroll down the <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/data/widely-viewed-content-report/#widely-viewed-content">most viewed pages</a> report, and you will see pages such as “Do You Remember When” and “That ain't right”. Which tells you all you need to know about the people spending the most time using Facebook.</p><p>Communities and groups are one of the biggest drivers of serious Facebook traffic. That same report shows pages such as “The Typical Mom” and “All Things Mamma” raking in 96m and 92m views per quarter. So, clearly there are people using Facebook, and loads of them, but they are not creating content for the site. They are interacting with others, forming groups and seeking advice.</p><p>I have always considered Facebook a bit of a distribution space anyway. Words go on a blog first, videos always got to YouTube first and photos go on Instagram. The fact that the Newsfeed is filled with plagiarism is not really a surprise to anyone.</p>

     <p>Undoubtedly, the biggest thing I was looking forward to with the macOS Monterey update was Shortcuts. It promises to be the final piece in automating the Apple universe. Admittedly, it is a bit hit-and-miss, feeling as if it’s still in beta, but most things work well. My favourite part is pinning Shortcuts to the menu bar, and this is my favourite one.</p>
<p>In creating this Shortcut, I took inspiration from <a href="https://twitter.com/linuz90/status/1458533540673564681?s=20">Gabrizio Rinaldi’s version</a> that I found via <a href="https://birchbark.substack.com/p/the-truth-is-paywalled-but-this-newsletter">The Birchtree Bark Newsletter</a>. However, I wasn’t happy with just starting the screensaver. This is fine if you are working from home, but I work in an office and regulations dictate my workstation must be locked when I am not at it. This took a bit of work as older versions made for Automator no longer work, but step forward some simple Apple script to save the day.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b44f623456.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="944" /></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b493a5f2850541aa8ace73b1bde2d951">Grab it</a></p>
<p>This small shortcut will quit all apps, put the volume down to 0 (no one wants to hear your Mac pinging when you’re at home) and also lock your Mac. You can leave some apps running if you need to by customising the first step in the Shortcut. All you need to do is click on ‘choose’ and select any apps you want to keep running.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/28c29066c4.jpg" alt="" width="1560" height="1398" /></figure>
<p>You will need to give Shortcuts permission to run scripts. Also make sure this is pinned to the menu bar as if you try to run it from within Shortcuts the last part will not work as the app has been killed halfway through!</p>
<p>You are welcome to add in other automations on the end of this, like Gabrizio did, such as switching off HomeKit enabled lights or putting the heating up a bit for when you get home. I debated playing a sound clip to signal me clocking out, but I might use this a few times a day so I didn’t want to annoy myself! It would be great to see what you do, so let me know.</p>
<p>Update: Slight tweek to make sure the whole script can run.</p>

     <p>I know I am not supposed to. Well, I am supposed to, it’s human nature, but I am supposed to hate myself for it. I think that's the way I am supposed to feel about likes on my photos. To be clear, we are talking about Instagram at all times, no other photo service gets the reach that the ‘gram does, and perhaps that's the real travesty here. Yet, I can’t go anywhere else because, according to some, I am an attention seeker.</p><p>Being already hyper conscious of my tendency to <a href="/2021/02/11/needing-feedback.html">crave some response</a> to the things I post online, I should really gravitate towards photo services such as <a href="/2021/12/27/glass-feelings.html">Glass</a>. I’ve gone <a href="/2021/08/24/my-glass-half.html">backwards</a> and <a href="/2021/09/01/refill-my-glass.html">forwards</a> on this excellent service and won’t go into my thoughts here. Needless to say, it just doesn’t provide what I need from a photo service. They are steadfast on not cowering to the social media trope of including likes, but that means a lot of your photos go without anything.</p><p>If the works for you, and is the reason you use Glass or another platform, cool. I wish it didn't mean as much to me, but the only option on Glass is leaving a comment. Which is great i theory, but they mainly devolve into talking or asking questions. Actual feedback is very minimal, and I leave far more than I receive. Leaving questions such as are my photos any good, are they not being seen, does my photo style just not fit? Do I need to keep going or give up completely? Wanting a quick, easy way to give and receive feedback is not a lot to ask.</p><p>I could post my photos to the dumpster fire that is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/photocritique/">/r/photocritique</a>, but I feel if I did, I might give up taking photos completely. Being mostly friendly, unfortunately I have seen users go to town on photos because the subject faced the wrong way, or they didn’t use composition correctly. All feedback that may be needed, but I think I can judge how good my shot is from a tried and tested source — likes.</p><p>Public likes are obviously a contentions subject. Research suggests they are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920307005">terrible for people</a> that begin to use them as a marker to judge themselves. Granted I am not a teenage girl, that seem to be affected the most, but I really like them on my photos. I am not going to spam hashtags to game the system and delete photos that don’t do well, but a small bit of reward goes a long way when you are learning.</p><p>Likes get a bad rep, but the way that Instagram implement them is purely for their gain, not ours. Played like a slot machine to manipulate users of the service to post more and spend more time using the service. However, done correctly, likes <em>could</em> be a useful metric to measure yourself against — although I have not seen them done well on any service yet. The issues are often the humans behind them that seek more and more feedback <a href="/2020/09/01/the-trickle-down.html">in an attention economy</a> — again coming back to Facebook.</p><p>Perhaps likes are not the issue, it’s Facebook, but there may never be an answer. Certainly, not one that suits everyone, so I am still not sure how I feel about them.</p>

     <p>I’ve been learning photography for around 4 years now. I love looking back, sometimes through hands covering my face, at old photos I have taken and seeing my progression over time. It is one of those skills, like writing consistently, that seems like it should be effortless but in fact is reasonably complicated. I’ve had <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/other-peoples-trash-can/">frustrating times</a> when it’s been a struggle to keep motivated, but I haven’t acquired these new skills by buying something.</p><p>All I want to be is a good photographer. That's all I really want from life. Take photos, edit, and go to interesting places that allow me to do those things. When I started, deciding it was time to stop using my phone and buy a ‘proper camera’, I wanted the best thing available. Spending hours reading all over the internet, having a look at what I could afford, and pushing my budget further and further up. I decided eventually that wasn’t the right move, and spent a lot of time with a small Sony A5000 before moving up the range.</p><blockquote>Learn how to do the things you want to do instead of buying things hoping it will allow you to do the thing you want to do. — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq4xfqZCp6yt0Q_GcHY9AZg">Patrick Tomasso</a></blockquote><p>I still get these feeling now. The number of times I have thought “that lens would make my images so much better” I prefer not to admit. When in fact I don’t need to buy anything, I just needed to practice, review and learn the skills needed. Buying a thing doesn’t get you anywhere, new <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-new-productivity/">apps don’t make you more productive</a>, new platforms don’t make you write more, and buying things is just an endless loop.</p><p>Purchasing instead of learning gets you nowhere apart from deeper in debt. You don’t need to spend anything to become something, just time and effort — which is perhaps the most expensive thing you own. I wanted to become a good photographer (I still do) but there is nothing I can buy to make me one.</p>

You can of course push back and claim that the leaks were of information gleamed from internal documents and not form actually decision makers but it’s clear that they reflect the overall nature of the beats.</p><p>When it comes to misinformation, <em>internal</em> Facebook research noted that people are at least 4x more likely to see misinformation from a shares post. That is that if the original post users see is from outside of their friends list is four times more likely to be false, and up to 20 times in some situations. Lets that just sink in for a moment.</p><p>Two years ago, Facebook discovered that users were seeing false information shared into their newsfeed and apparently did nothing about it. The research goes on to make a recommendation that adding friction to sharing or blocking sharing all together would help mitigate the issues they were facing. Whilst it’s not known for sure if <em>any</em> action was taken, employees did openly discuss the findings on internal systems, it is clear they did not make any meaningful changes.</p>

     <p>In July of this year, I <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/07/09/a-quick-check/">quit twitter for the longest I ever have done</a>. It was only about two weeks, but I did it properly this time, <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/07/08/deactivated-twitter/">deactivated my account</a> and everything. I can see your expression from here, I know this isn't an achievement to be lauded up, but it was pretty good for me. Having started to pull back in March, I had finally had enough. Every time I have tried to do it before, I failed. Finding myself checking the web app at least once a day. In many instances, I also just replaced Twitter with another social media platform, <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/03/28/why-microblog/">usually micro.blog</a>.</p><p>Granted, I am using Twitter again, but reading <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/books/deep-work-rules-for-focused-success-in-a-distracted-world/9780349411903">Deep Work</a> by Call Newport is making me want to pull back again. Perhaps not from everything like the extreme examples given in the book, but I find myself nodding along to the majority of the points raised. There is no doubt I experience some side effects discussed. All the signs are there. Struggling to focus sometimes, getting distracted by simple things, massive procrastination, the list goes on.</p><p>Frustratingly, this should have been already obvious having read <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/books/the-shallows-how-the-internet-is-changing-the-way-we-think-read-and-remember/9781838952587">The Shallows</a> some years ago. I am becoming convinced that the modern connected world is running my brain, but I need it so much that I couldn’t even dream of long periods of deep work away from it all. I can’t put this all on social media, though. My, and in fact everyone's, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-fix-email-science">relationship to email is broken</a>. The unwritten expectation of swift replies has tormented me into time blocking my day to periods when I deal with email. Pushing everything else to the extremities does a lot for the work that I love.</p><p>There is no better feeling of contentment than becoming engrossed in a task you enjoy. Focussing on a topic you relish engaging with, otherwise why do it, and having no distractions to bring you out of flow state. Time disappears and projects get completed, simply by removing the triggers. Long ago, I accepted that I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-cant-go/">can’t go back</a> to simpler times, but I can make my time simpler. I can go deeper into tasks and I get far more enjoyment from doing so. Not only from completing the task at hand, but more enjoyment when I do surface.</p><p>Roll this out to family time and other tasks that I love doing like photography and not only am I more engaged with what’s in front of me I am also enjoying social media more (email still sucks).</p>

The gatekeepers of publications — the printers, the producers and the large corporations — no longer have the hold they once had. Information can spread wider and faster than it ever has before.

I am not sure what the answer to the misinformation issue. It may be more journalism, more publishing and better independence from social platforms. One thing I do know is that if these issues are not stemmed soon the future will look back on this period with distain and laugh at how stupid we all were.</p>

Others get these feelings too, something I am calling blog envy.</p><p>I look at blog designs like <a href="https://birchtree.me">Birchtree.me</a> and think to myself “I want a blog like that” and then go out and try to build one. Setting up a new local installation of Ghost, or WordPress, or whatever the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/why-micro-blog/">thing at the time</a> is I think I need to have. Of course, a few hours in I have something that looks somewhat like my inspiration but more like a cheap man's imitation. Importing posts and fixing things take a few more hours, when infact I should have spent those hours doing something more constructive.</p><p>There is no doubt that I have picked up some skills in doing this, a fact that was put to the test when building <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/a-new-home/">my new home</a>, but it was still a lot of time wasted. I am often reminded of a <a href="https://www.nitinkhanna.com/dont-moleskine-your-blog/">post by Nitin Khanna</a> that expanded on an idea by Jeff Perry. It is a post well worth reading, unfortunately the original inspiration has been lost to Jeff’s restless blog syndrome, but if you will allow me to paraphrase a little. It draws parallels between not wanting to ruin a nice, expensive notebook with subpar notes, to playing with your blog so much you never write on it. Something I know a <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/i-need-to/">little about!</a></p><p>I shouldn't beat myself up that much, but I see it in loads of others that spend money moving things about and getting nowhere apart from deeper in debt. Jealousy is not a bad emotion to have about the results of someone’s hard work and years’ worth of effort. However, the response is emulating the effort put in and not worry about the design or the way they do things. Not least because if you do finally achieve the emulation you desire, it won’t be yours anyway.</p><p>Spending hours creating a website is fine, if you have something to put on there in the first place. When creating this very website I tried out loads of awesome designs but when push came to shove they just didn’t reflect me. My blog is an <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/my-blog-is-an-extension-of-me/">extension of me</a>, and I shouldn’t be jealous of others because they are not me.</p>

     <p>Joshua Ginter on the <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2021/11/03/the-m1-pro-macbook-pro-keyboard-is-different-than-the-m1-macbook-air-keyboard/">difference between the M1 MacBook Air and the new MacBook Pro keyboards</a>:</p><blockquote>There’s a noticeable difference between the new M1 Pro MacBook Pro Magic Keyboard and the M1 MacBook Air Magic Keyboard. The M1 Pro keyboard sounds different, has stronger feedback and actuation accuracy, and has smaller function-keys.</blockquote><p>I am no mechanical keyboard aficionado, but I love having a keyboard with the right amount of tactile feedback. There is something about having good key travel and a reassuring press that makes me feel at home.</p><p>It is remarkable how much faster I type, how more accurate I am, and just how much more I want to write on a good keyboard. I am sure there his some science behind it, but I am not sure how I would even sum it all up adequately. As I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/can-you-stop-messing-around-with-keyboards-now/">wrote about previously</a>, the butterfly keyboards I used were fine, the return to scissor switches was of course better — but the new MacBook Pros’ keyboards are superb.</p>

     <p>There were certain periods in my life where I was so ingrained into the world of technology that nothing else entered my mind. I was working in it all day, then writing and talking about it all night. It was my 'thing' and I enjoyed it, but I was boring. Sure, I loved being around cutting-edge technology, getting the inside scoop on loads of new things coming before the market did, but there comes a point where you're just not a well-rounded person any more.</p><p>I was for all intents and purposes <a href="https://gr36.com/2017/10/24/not-being-a/">a 'fanboy'</a>. The things I used where such a part of me that I felt I had found my tribe, and I was absolutely going to tell everyone about it. First it was Android because I chose to use Googles OS and not that stupid fruit one, my calling was to argue the point on almost everything there was about it. My friends all asked me for tech advice, came to me to know things, and I preached my calling to all that would listen.</p><p>My <a href="https://gr36.com/2020/11/14/my-journey-to/">journey to Apple</a> was a long and boring one, but I don't feel like I needed to be like I was when I used Android. Now I am part of the Goliath and not fighting with my fellow Davids. That was until the iPad Air 2 came along. When handed one for my job, it had to quickly become my everything. On my journey to <a href="https://gr36.com/2017/02/19/one-year-of/">tweak and bend the iPad to work for me,</a> I defended it as if it were my child. Because I was so invested in the whole ecosystem around working on an iPad, it became a part of me, and in many ways I was an "iPad guy" before many of the people currently looked up to even started. I was in before it was cool!</p><p>I got emotional when people like <a href="https://randomdumber.blogspot.com/2017/06/joshua-topolsky-trashes-ipad-as.html">Joshua Topolsky</a> trashed by beloved iPad, and defended it to the death. It was in fact when using an iPad <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/today-is-the/">became too much</a> I that I began to see that others may have a point too. My passion for something was blinding me to see anything else. When in fact there are far too many reasons behind what tools we use and things we buy that others may never understand. In much the case, we as content creators often feel the need to defend or explain our purchasing decisions to people that consume our things for reasons I still don’t understand myself.</p><p>Now my tools mean very little to me. Sure, I have strong preferences towards iPhones and particularly macOS, but they are <a href="https://gr36.com/2019/06/11/im-not-an/">not part of me any longer</a>. I love technology, and mainly stick to Apple products as I know them the best, but I can't be as evangelical for them as I used to be able to. In many respects the tribalism we feel is natural, no one likes things they love receiving negativity but it gets a bit much after a point. Use what you use and be happy.</p>

     <p>Raheem Stirling speaking to Wired about the <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/mental-strength/a38170363/raheem-sterling-headspace-ambassador/">benefits of meditation</a>:</p><blockquote>It’s only now that I can see the benefits of such a practice on people of all ages and I’m really looking forward to the difference we can make together in developing the conversation around mental health, educating on tools and resources that can help people manage everyday challenges.</blockquote><p>I wrote a while ago about the strange response you get from <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/meditation-has-a-pr-problem/">suggesting meditation</a> to others. The perception of meditation is still very varied. Although now more than ever people seem open to trying new practices to improve their mental health, meditation is still a bit woo woo for most.</p><p>Heaven forbid you utter the word mindfulness. Marketing companies seem to have ruined this word for anyone to use, carrying with it all kinds of hippie visions.</p><p>Anything that brings this wonderful practice to more people, and allows others to see the benefits to almost everything in their life is a benefit.

     <p>I am a simple soul that falls for far too many marketing ploys. Companies don’t even have to put much effort in, either. I listen to people on the internet far more than I should do. It only takes a <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/josh-ginters-ulysses-setup-and-workflow/">post like this</a> by Josh Gunter <a href="https://twitter.com/gr36/status/1456809562561028099?s=21">for me to clean</a> up my Ulysses set up and dive back into it again.</p><p>This could be the fourth or fifth time I have returned to using Ulysses. I’m never quite sure why I stop, I just get destructed by the new hottest thing and have my head turned. I try <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/my-obsidian-set/">almost every new thing</a> because, as Josh says in the opening live of his Ulysses <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/josh-ginters-ulysses-setup-and-workflow/">set up post</a>, “I have these on-again, off-again relationships with certain types of apps”. Although he doesn’t with writing apps, these and task managers are my weakness — but <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/looking-for-my/">after last time</a> I really should have learnt my lesson.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/2769ef5d64.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>Enough self deprivation, let’s move on. I found the idea of a kanban set up of-sorts inside Ulysses interesting. Although my usual use of an inbox and folders for deferent types of post weren’t a million miles away, this is another step towards regular posting. For me, it’s all about getting things down on paper, at least digitally. It’s easy to forget ideas, or lose them in another notes app, but storing everything in an inbox or ideas folder should help me write more. It also won’t hurt to allow me to delete a few once the idea has settled a little!</p><p>By moving things down the question a little, I am already writing a bit more when I have a few moments, or checking over posts that I need to edit. Filling a few moments with writing or jotting down notes rather than anything else. Storing ideas and links for posts is also easy with Shortcuts integrations with Ulysses, I may share this Shortcut once I have settled on a set-up I am happy with. You never quite know with me, I might be on to the next thing pretty soon, but this setup should push me to publish more. Please <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/josh-ginters-ulysses-setup-and-workflow/">check it out for yourself</a> and see if this setup could improve your workflow to.</p>

     <p>In all the time sucking manipulative apps I have ever installed on my phone, Instagram gets me every time. The Facebook affect has turned my once beloved app into a cesspool of attention-seeking posts that use all the UI tricks in the book to hook me in. It gets me every time. There are too many good things about it to stop using my account completely, so imagine my surprise when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-desktop-web-post-creation-and-collabs-150032945.html">posting from the web</a> became available.</p><p>As part of quite a few updates to the way Instagram works that are happening at the moment, Meta have launched web posting after announcing the upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550010/instagram-post-from-desktop-web-browser-testing">feature in January</a>. It’s a welcome feature to. Everyone who uses a camera knows the slight annoyance of editing your image in Lightroom after importing from an SD card. Only then having to save to Photos or send it to your phone to post to Instagram. Sure, it’s a first world problem, but it always felt like one that could be fixed. Instagram has a web interface, yet chose to close off parts of the experience to only mobile users — no doubt all in the pursuit of growth.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/e3df2518f1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>As much as I love <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/refill-my-glass/">using Glass</a> there are far more people on Instagram and I find more posts of awesome pictures for me to look at. So sucking me straight in and wasting my time doesn’t take much doing, especially with all the wonderful autumn colours in new images being posted. Thankfully, I am awe of this and try to limit my usage or not have the app installed unless I want to post. It feels like this update is for people like me to solve the two issues pointed out above but still get usage.</p><p>It’s not perfect. There are still a few features missing from the web experience, such as editing previously posted images, but it’s a gigantic improvement. Along with recently going back to <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1455947657067782148?s=21">allowing image previews on Twitter</a> it’s great to see the service improving. If they could just get rid of the shopping tab and actually get interested in me adding photos again, that would be great!</p>

     <p>I know what you're thinking…. again! This time I haven't fallen out with myself and moved just because someone else <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/migrating-from-wordpress/">told me how good their blogging platform is</a>. Or decided that I want to try to quit something yet again. This time it's a little more important because I have got my hands on a new domain and wanted to build something to last.</p><p>After years of trying, literally the first time I tried was 2014, I have managed to purchase gregmorris.co.uk. It took a while of going backwards and forwards with domain buyers, but here we are. Now that I have a domain that reflects me a little better, I wanted a website that reflects what I am up to. It didn’t seem right just porting my <a href="https://gr36.com/">scruffy WordPress blog</a> and I have been lusting after something more portfolio based for a long time.</p><p>My first thoughts were to implement my photography into my blog posts here on Ghost, but I annoy enough people with the range of things I post about that I didn’t want to worsen it with my photos too. So I built this.</p><p>It isn’t all my work. The theme started off as <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Edge">Edge</a>, a photography-based theme that is official and free. The theme looks lovely, but I dusted off my skills and made a blog page to go with it that is brand new. I also tidied up the CCS, made things my own and implemented a dark mode (your eyes will thank me). I’ve worked really hard on it, hence <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1456334349880680459?s=20">the radio silence for a while</a> and dedicated a lot of my time to learning many new skills. Likewise, I keep expecting things to break, but they seem OK at the moment as long as I don’t <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/i-need-to/">keep playing with it</a>.</p><h2 id="what-about-gr36">What about GR36?</h2><p>Nothing will happen with that domain for a while. All of my posts have moved over, but redirecting all the historical traffic I get will take some time for me to work out how to do it best. I will more than likely keep the domain around for the foreseeable, and do something with it once I am happy that everything is done correctly. I am a little sad that after more than a decade blogging <a href="http://gr36.com/">gr36.com</a> might die off, but I am excited that my website better reflects my interests.</p><p>For the next few weeks, expect internal links to be a little broken on my new website as I update everything. I kept all the permanent link structure the same, but there is no avoiding a complete domain change. I have a new <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/rss/">RSS feed</a> which I may point the GR36 one at shortly.</p><p>I would love to know your feedback and opinions on anything I should change, privately if possible.</p>

     <p>At their October event Apple unveiled <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2021/10/apple-unveils-game-changing-macbook-pro/">huge improvements</a> to the ‘pro’ line up of laptops. Moving the whole line over to their own silicone, adding in <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/making-bets-on-the-future-is-risky/">more ports</a> and silently whispering an apology. Despite more than 5 years meddling with them, adding in needless features as well overcomplicating and compromising their laptops — they are done with meddling with keyboards. How long this will last, who knows, but the simple (all be it silent) admission that can be read between the lines, is that they were wrong in almost all areas. The constant march towards thinner and thinner devices simply does not work with laptops.</p><p>In order to slim down their laptop line in the last few years Apple, understandably, made quite a few decisions that were at detriment to its users. Battery life suffered. Connectivity needed by many of its users was removed and replaced by dongles, but most damaging was the compromise to the working of the laptop. The butterfly keyboard is perhaps one of the most damming decisions Apple has ever made about its computers. I was one of the lucky ones that wasn’t affected at all through my usage of them, yet still queued up to pick up my 2020 version once they returned to more traditional scissor switches.</p><p>As someone that types out thousands of words a day, I do have some opinions on these keyboards but this post isn’t really about them. It’s more about the way companies view the keyboards themselves. They have improved slightly over the years, but remained pretty mush as they were decades ago. A bit like the mouse, you can mess around with some things, add in buttons or make using it easier to use, but you cant change the way they work. The touch points are the most important area of a computer, and like handle bars on a bike, need to feel good and work well.</p><p>Who knows if Apple saw the future of typing on their computers as being as close to glass as possible, but that’s not a future I want to be a part of. The butterfly keyboards I used were fine, you get used to them in the end (unless yours breaks) but as soon as you return to something using scissor switches you realise who bad they are. Nothing beats good key travel and a nice tactile feel — there are whole industries built around it worth <a href="https://www.knowledge-sourcing.com/report/global-mechanical-keyboard-market">more than $1billion</a>.</p><p>I can forgive the Touchbar (also now removed) as a gimmick that Apple thought would become more useful. It didn’t hurt the keyboard, apart from needing more concentration to use than it should do, but messing around with the keyboard itself gets much more of a reaction. The company is now aware that is customers like <a href="https://screenrant.com/apple-2021-macbook-pro-no-touch-bar-why/">full-Sized, tactile keys</a> but I am not sure why it took 5 years to work it out. Perhaps now they will stop messing around with the keyboard and continue to build thicker, more capable laptops that have what their customers need.</p>

     <p>Casey Newton on <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/facebook-goes-meta">Facebook going Meta</a>:</p><blockquote>It struck me, given the recent conversation around how old and out of touch Facebook has been lately, how strong the Boomer vibes were coming from those reacting to Thursday’s presentation. A surprising number of people seem to think that technological progress ended with the smartphone, and that augmented reality, virtual reality, and connected experiences between platforms will never come to pass.</blockquote><p>I’m not into all opinions that seems a little bit like an old man shaking his fist at the sky being labelled ‘boomer’ but I completely understand where Casey is coming from here.</p><p>I don’t think there is anyone of the opinion that technological advancements stopped at the smartphone but if you are of a certain age the prospect of VR/AR being “the future” has been spouted for decades and is still not here. So it may seem to some that land never seems to appear over the horizon.</p><p>All through the 80’s and 90’s VR was promised and hinted at through all sorts of media. Movies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lawnmower_Man_(film)">the Lawnmower Man</a>, and video games systems such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Boy">Virtual Boy</a> seemed to be the vanguard of a new era — only for the noise to die out for another couple of decades. We’ve also been searching for the next thing after mobile for years, so I think we can excuse the dismissive tendencies even without whoever is trying to build these things.</p>

     <p>I go backwards and forwards about what I want <a href="http://gr36.com/">gr36.com</a> to be. Over the years it has been a portfolio of sorts, an attempt at being a news website, a podcast host and lots of things in between. Nowadays it’s decidedly more amateur and more of an extension of myself that evolves over time depending on what I am up to and an extension of myself.</p><p>I don’t even have a ‘thing’ I want to write about. Most people seem to have an issue, or a cause, or even an interest they want to cover all the ins and outs of. I loosely revolve around technology but expand into all sorts of areas that I am interested in, but I guess thats the point a personal blog should be an extension of the person hitting the publish button.</p><p>Everything that my blog is I have learnt to do. I have studied zero computing skills officially, but my blog as taught me HTML and CSS skills along with some serve management things, SEO knowledge and a vast number of things — many of which I have already forgotten. The current WordPress is self-hosted, when it was <a href="http://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a> I had to learn all the Hugo things that made it tick. As such, in times of hardship when I wonder why bother I remember that my blog is more than words, it is a place I have grown.</p><blockquote>But most importantly, I want to be able to be wrong. I want to change my mind! I want to evolve. . . .blogging feels to me like a world of endless drafting, endless revisioning. – <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2021/02/09/blogging-as-a-forgiving-medium/">Austin Kleon</a></blockquote><p>I have written a great many words, most of them terrible, but most of which have taught me something about myself just through the act of typing them out. I have changed my mind, worked thing through and changed as a person because I have written them on the internet. I want to be held accountable for the words that come from me and a blog is the best place to do it. As Austin write about above, it’s more forgiving than putting all of your thoughts on social media. You are allowed to get things wrong. Be forgiven for the occasional (or more than occasional) spelling mistake or typo because a blog is you.</p><p>Much like the post on a blog, that you can edit, improve, and grow them they reflect the thoughts that spurred them in the first place. Austin Kleon also goes on to point out the importance of getting things wrong later in his post he says “Being wrong publicly is the easiest way to learn what you need to know.” This applies to a friend texting you to say that the MacBook Pro 13″ has <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/dont-buy-the-m1-macbook-pro/">two ports and not four,</a> but also to opinions you have on anything. I can get things wrong in person, or on social media, but there is nothing quite like writing a post and growing because I wrote it.</p><p>The design is a bit weird; the words are hit and miss but it’s my blog, and it’s personal.</p><p>Edit: Not long after this <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/a-new-home/">I found a new home</a></p>

     <p>As much as <a href="https://gr36.com/2020/10/30/of-my-favourite/">I love 1Password</a>, I don’t love having to pay yet another subscription. So when Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529266/passkeys-icloud-keychain-ios-15-passwordless-future-security-login">overhauled their password manager</a> I was intrigued to try it out as fast as possible. Sure, using a fully integrated system probably isn’t the safest way to do things, but given 1Passwords <a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-the-story-so-far/">move away from OS specific apps</a> these improvements could be exactly what I needed.</p><p>At first look it works well enough to get most people going. Improving the security of average users accounts by suggesting much stronger passwords. The recent improvements also allows users to add in one time passwords, otherwise referred to as two factor authentication codes. Without doubt it is leading users down a path to making sure their accounts are much more secure and anything that allows you to do this without any technical knowledge is a good move. Even if it is perhaps not the <em><em>very</em></em> best practice to follow it is better than no password manager at all.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="uploads/2024/6e6fba244e.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1302" /></figure><p>With that said, entry of passwords is not always the easiest when compared to other options. Providing the website or app is developed correctly you can put in usernames, passwords and two factor codes with a few taps, but if not it is a pain to go into setting and find them. Well this <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/02578985347f49d7b4f3d95b75e0c062">Shortcut</a> created by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Krokmou/">Reddit user Krokmau</a> enables access on not just iOS but also macOS providing you have the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/macos/monterey/">Monterey update</a> installed allowing access to Shortcuts. Once run it will detect what OS is being used and display the passwords stored in iCloud.</p><p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/02578985347f49d7b4f3d95b75e0c062">Grab it HERE</a></p><p>I have pinned this to my menu bar on my mac as well as put it in the iOS widget on my homescreen so I have easier access than I have ever had before. I am sure Apple will improve things moving forward but perhaps not for another year. So in the mean time this Shortcut will save you loads of time hunting around in settings.</p>

     <p>Lee Peterson on <a href="https://ljpuk.net/2021/10/22/should-you-trust-giftfromgoogle-reviews/">his lack of trust in #giftfromgoogle reviews</a>:</p><blockquote>As part of the Pixel 6 rollout Google gives out their latest devices to YouTubers and they are encouraged to share their thoughts via this hashtag. Don’t trust these reviews, it’s a gift so it’s already in the name they will mostly be a biased view point showing the positives not a real work review.</blockquote><p>So just like pretty much every review then. Look I get it, the hashtag is a bit weird this year, and perhaps is a way to display #ad without actually saying it — but Google gives out Pixels to people all over YouTube every year — just like what seems like every other brand on the planet.</p><p>With that said, I agree with Lee. I absolutely do not believe what half the reviews say on YouTube currently. I have to watch loads of them to get an overview of what is actually going on and then try and pick out the topics reviewers have been told to cover. It’s pretty easy to pick them out because the same words are repeated but some brands are being downright manipulative about what is shown. Anyone remember the original Surface duo weird review embargoes? The below video from Mrwhosetheboss goes through the issues we face as consumers in loads of detail.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card">

     <p>Without getting too much into the tools I use (yet again) I have been enjoying using <a href="https://notion.so/">Notion</a> lately for all of my productivity needs. It’s not perfect but the power and flexibility it offers me for free is pretty crazy. One of the downsides is using it on the go as the iOS apps leave a little to be desired, but seeing as my usage on mobile is limited now I built a shortcut to help out.</p><h2 id="the-set-up">The Set Up</h2><p>The Notion API has been around a little while but it’s very under utilised in my opinion. Given the fact Notion appeals to a wide rage of businesses and individuals alike it comes as no surprised that the API allows for quite a lot to be achieved without even opening the app. In order to get access to this you will need to visit their integrations page and set up you own access token.</p><p>1 – Whilst signed in to Notion, head to the <a href="https://www.notion.com/my-integrations">main page for setting up automation</a> and add a new integration with a name of your choice. Once set up you will need the API Key, so copy this somewhere safe. This allows limitless access to your Notion data (with a few bits of extra information needed) so please keep it safe!</p><p>2 -Second you will need the ID of the database you want to add information into, you can find this in the URL when the database is open as a page. This does not work with Linked Databases so make sure you have the original one open and copy the URL.</p><pre><code class="language-jsx">https://www.notion.so/{workspace_name}/{database_id}?v={view_id}
</code></pre><p>If you have only one Workspace you wont have the Workspace name in your URL, so just copy everything after the Notion URL and before the question mark.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/a19ce8904e.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="827" height="418" /></figure><p>While you have this page open share this database with your integration by clicking <strong><strong>‘Share’</strong></strong> then <strong><strong>‘Add people, emails, groups or integrations’</strong></strong> and selecting the integration you just set up. This gives the API full access to this database only. In my example below this is my ‘Inbox’ where everything goes first for me to sort out later on at my desk.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="uploads/2024/5ed5c14b64.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1536" height="596" /></figure><h2 id="the-shortcut">The Shortcut</h2><p>Download the Shortcut found <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a6cd20ece2324bdc9981eb266e8345d8">here</a>. Paste in the API Key when requested and secondly add in the Database ID. You can change these afterwards by editing the commented text boxes with the relevant data.</p><p>Once run, this simple set upasks you for a title and some content for the quick database entry you are making. This then puts the information into the below JSON format using the supplied variables. The real power of using the Notion API is the possibilities are huge. The API contains the ability to set up any number of blocks inside this page, rich text styling, adding images and loads more. You can find out more information in their <a href="https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started">extensive API documents</a>.</p><pre><code class="language-html">{
    "parent": { "database_id": "{database ID￼}" },
    "properties": {
        "title": {
      "title": [{ "type": "text", "text": { "content": "{page title}" } }]
        }
    },
    "children": [
    {
      "object": "block",
      "type": "paragraph",
      "paragraph": {
        "text": [{ "type": "text", "text": { "content": "{block content}" } }]
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre><p>I have set up a few of these to be able to add in items for my Todo list, blog post ideas and also clip web information for me to look at later on. I may look at creating something much bigger in future as my usage of Notion increases, it may never <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/05/15/my-obsidian-set/">pull me away from Obsidian</a> fully but it’s an amazing service none the less. If you create something I would love to see where you go with the Notion API and Shortcuts.</p>

     <p>Matt Birchler with some <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/the-only-apple-silicon-mac-you-probably-shouldnt-buy/">comments on the MacBook to buy</a>:</p><blockquote>I would argue the only Apple Silicon Mac I can’t recommend is the 13” MacBook Pro. It’s several hundred dollars more than the Air and gets you the same performance in a larger body.</blockquote><p>My first thought was of course you wouldn’t buy the 13″ model when something so good has just launched. To be honest I wasn’t really aware that the ‘older’ model (can’t really call it old now can we) was still available but sure enough there it sits starting at £1299. No doubt to give Apple a marketing angle that their pro laptops start at a lot less than they actually do.</p><p>Sure, look at the MacBook Pros in isolation and the base model, hell even the £1499 512gb version is an attractive purchase for some people. A saving of at least £400 is nothing to be sniffed at. However throw the MacBook Air into the mix and it makes no sense to go for a cheaper Pro.</p><p>There will be some people out there that need 4 ports, or want to squeeze out a couple extras hours of battery life and there are some <em><em>very</em></em> minute <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/uk/face-off/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro">differences in performance</a> but for the saving of several hundred pounds more the macBook Air is the machine to go for unless you have deep pockets.</p><p>Edit: turns out the 13” MacBook Pro has the same two ports as the Air. So even less reasons to buy it.</p>

     <p>Jon Porter on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734645/apple-macbook-pro-2021-ports-magsafe-touch-bar-usb-c-future">Apple being ready to admit it was wrong about the future of laptops</a>:</p><blockquote>Whether that’s because Apple is more dominant when it comes to smartphones or just because the benefits of wireless audio were more obvious to people than USB-C accessories, people seem to have been far more ready to roll with Apple’s annoying headphone jack decision. There’s a valid debate to be had about whether Apple kicked off a trend towards wireless audio or whether its move just turbocharged one that was already taking place, but either way, Apple made a bet that the future of smartphone audio was wireless, and for all intents and purposes, it seems to have paid off.</blockquote><p>It is unusual for Apple to be early into new spaces of technology it is not unusual on them making bets on the future of computing. Some of these fail (butterfly keyboards), some of them take a long time to come to fruition (flash), and some are forced through simply because Apple is behind them (headphone jacks). All of these are calculated by people far more intelligent than you or I, but theses always those waiting around to point some fingers. Generally speaking Apple seem to take the approach that in computing it’s better to be at the front and corse correct when possible, then be behind and risk missing the boat entirely.</p><p>Whilst the linked post above is vastly exaggerated, it’s great to see Apple willing to make corrections when needed. With that said replacing the SD card slot is not admitting they were wrong on USB-C at all, as pointed out they just don’t have the clout to push forward like they do on mobile. Most devices seem to still be sold with a USB-A cable at least on one end, and with so many brands dragging their heels it becomes a drag to carry around a dongle but not as bad as others seem to make out.</p><p>Apple didn’t put USB-A ports back in their laptops, but they did concede the the future is not as <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/10/22/but-i-already-have-a-dongle/">wireless as they might have thought</a>. Unfortunately just a few months after admitting their bet on the future of keyboards they now return to a macBook that argues it has “pro-level” connectivity, when in fact it has a similar set up to a macBook found in 2015. Ouch.</p>

     <p>Jason Snell on the <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/10/exile-from-dongletown/">Exile from Dongletown</a>:</p><blockquote>Apple’s argument for getting rid of the SD slot was that the future would be wireless, and we wouldn’t need to use cards to transfer data anymore. It wasn’t true back in 2016, and it’s still not true. Sure, some devices equipped with SD cards now offer wireless data transfer, but let me tell you—it’s not as fast or reliable as just plugging in a card and transferring the data!</blockquote><p>I still see this crop up from time to time. “I don’t need one because I have a dongle now” or “my camera supports some weird transfer over WiFi that I need an app for”. <em><em>Nothing</em></em> beats having an SD in your laptop, even more so for one aimed at pros.</p><p>I might be an <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/the-pro-default/">edge case for people that will buy a MacBook Pro</a> but I use 2-3 cards in rotation almost daily. Having to shoot onto multiple cards because they fill up fast. Not to mention I am away from my computer while doing this so I rely on being able to transfer all of this onto my Mac in one go. Even in a world where things have moved forward a few years and some cameras are moving partly to CFexpress but an SD card slot just makes sense if you have the room in the machine to put one.</p><p>A dongle is fine, but a built in slot is better.</p>

     <p>I always love a good trip to the Apple store. A little to gaze at all its capitalist glory, but I usually have a good chat with the person sorting my stuff out and enjoy meeting some new people. Picking up my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/a-month-without-an-apple-watch/">Apple Watch</a> last week was no different and I had a good chat about the recent iPhone with the person helping me. We chatted for quite a while about their range of Pro devices.</p><p>We joked about what even is a Pro device, and that it means different things on different products, but they pointed out the surprising range of people that buy Pro branded products. To give you the cliff notes of our conversation, they pointed put how great the iPhone 13 is, and the iPad / MacBook Air. It’s great to have a device at every price point, but the reality is that a lot of people buy the most expensive one they can afford and often stretch to buy the Pro device without the need.</p><p>The anecdotal evidence seems to point towards the same conclusions. Your local coffee house features people browsing the internet, or writing Word docs on £1500+ laptops, and I have lost count of the number of friends whose children have written a MacBook Pro on their Christmas list. Every year when the new iPhone comes around, I see a whole new range of people that buy the expensive Pro phone and start taking photos walks for a few weeks to justify the costs. Sure, people can spend money however they wish, and more power to you, but Pro shouldn’t be your default.</p><p>This was even more evident, something I almost feel for myself, at <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-events/october-2021/">yesterday’s event</a>. Apple launched some new, good but staggeringly expensive, laptops yesterday which most people have zero need for. I work in a field that typically relies on powerful equipment to export video and manipulate designs easily and the power is still far more than I need. My 2017 iMac still doesn’t miss a beat, and no doubt more power would speed things up, but the cost isn’t worth the trade-off.</p><p>These Pros are for those that need <em><em>serious</em></em> power on the go, yet I have a feeling I will see these all over the place in a few weeks. Apple devices have always been a status thing for some. Like designer clothing the enjoyment comes from brandishing something just for the cost – or so I am told. I can’t wait to be able to pick those notched screens out with not too much trouble and have a look at what tasks are being done on a machine that is at least a thousand pound more expensive than required.</p><p>Of course, you do you, but the rest of the range are great too you know. Perhaps something cheaper might actually be better for you.</p>

     <p>Every time I tweet these words or heaven forbid say them out loud, I get a wide variety of strange looks and responses. Many of which I couldn’t really understand and some of which could be the start of alienation completely. For some strange reason, some people took this personally — and that’s weird.</p><p>You may see my lack of need to use my phone as a statement of superiority. That I am looking down on those that do use their phones a lot, and while it could come across like this, nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is I could be seen on the same level as those weird families that didn’t have a TV while you were growing up. Not in a modern way — they don’t feel the need because they watch shows on a tablet or laptop — but because they don’t like it. These people seem to look down on others that did have a TV, and as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKjJQ5q32b4">Joey on friends asked</a>, I never quite worked out what all their furniture pointed at.</p><p>I did use my phone a lot in years gone past. When spending hours and days on the road it became my lifeline back to my family and my working device. Sure <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/one-year-of/">I had an iPad</a>, but my phone was always the biggest and best battery life iPhone I could get. It never left my person and I used it constantly.</p><p>Until the iPad mini was announced I was also talking myself into going with the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/minimalism-and-big-phones/">Pro Max version</a> this year and wrote about my thought process behind it (and some self-affirmation I needed). However, I spend most of my day sat at an iMac and when I am at home I just want to be away from things. So, my phone only fills in the small gaps now, it’s <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/iphone-13-mini-review-problems-solved/">small itself</a> because my needs have changed. I don’t use it much, but not in a weird way!</p>

     <p>I’ve been toying with the idea of <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/stopping-wearing-my/">not using an Apple Watch</a> on off for a few years. Usually when summer rolls around and I don’t want a tan line I think about leaving it at home more, but always go back after a few days. Well, this year I had an enforced hiatus from having an Apple Watch and its taught me a few things.</p><p>I wrongly sold my Apple Watch a week before the new one was announced thinking I would be without it for a little over two weeks maximum. Yet here we are a month later and still a week or so to wait. It has been a weird experience because I have had one strapped to my wrist <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/i-like-this/">since the first version</a>. In fact, it is one of my favourite devices that I have ever purchased and, until the Series 6, have upgraded religiously each time. I can boil the reasons why I love wearing an Apple Watch Down to two areas and lacking one for a while has allowed me to see things a bit more clearly.</p><h2 id="heath-tracking">Heath Tracking</h2><p>I love being active, It’s as simple as that. Although many life things get in the way I always find time to work out, even just a little. Before the Apple Watch launched, I went through a series of fitness trackers, <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/gadgets/21005/nike-sportwatch-gps">running watches</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike%2B_FuelBand">fuel bands</a>. Nothing quite filled the areas that I wanted nor provided me with something I could rely on.</p><p>This is the area I have missed most while being ‘Apple Watchless’. Although I have enjoyed the odd run a little more being freed from the ability to check how fast I am going, I miss the tracking. Being able to see how much I have been moving and see if I need to push a little further to fill my rings is priceless. I also like being able to keep an eye on my heart rate first thing in the morning and can often spot tiredness or illness coming before I feel it.</p><p>Of course, there are alternatives to this. However, health data is so personal I don’t trust anyone else with it. I have years of health data in iCloud, so the simple fact is I won’t go anywhere else. I <em><em>could</em></em> use the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/how-to-set/">Strava phone app</a> and a HR monitor and sync this into Apple Health but the Apple Watch just makes everything so seamless.</p><h2 id="notifications">Notifications</h2><p>This has been the biggest revelation. Whilst I thought I was doing <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/notifications-haze/">pretty well</a> with managing all the dings and red dots. Turns out I have just been triaging them on my Apple Watch and not <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/how-you-use/">sorting the issue</a>. Due to the easy to feel taps on the wrist I can forget about, I have had my phone on silent for years and never really given it much attention. Now that I must have my phone on ringer, I have sorted the problem out for good. Setting up Home, Work and Sleep <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1445075198886154253">Focus modes</a> to make sure I <em><em>only</em></em> get what I need. Don’t get me wrong I had all the usual suspects turned off but was still pinged a surprising number of times by apps I had neglected. Such las Apples own media apps and personal email.</p><p>Overall. It has been an interesting experience, but I can’t wait to order one on Friday and return to some normality. It’s weird that a bit of tech has thrown me. I could live without it, but I don’t really want to.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Last year I decided the iPhone 12 Pro was the best choice in the line-up. It offered the best compromise for getting the best technology in a smartphone while not having to carry around a giant surfboard. Unfortunately, it still wasn’t perfect and didn’t feature the absolute best Apple has to offer leading some (<a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/the-iphone-line/">myself included</a>) to be a little frustrated in choosing a phone. Things are much fairer this year, but the choice is still a difficult one.</p>
<p>Whilst last year I bought all models of phone this time around I narrowed it down to two. My choice was between <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/iphone-13-mini-review-problems-solved/">the iPhone 13 Mini</a> for its awesome form factor or the iPhone 13 Pro. The more manageable ‘smaller’ version of Apples top of the line Pro models is better than ever in the key areas that users will care about – battery, camera, and screen.</p>
<h2 id="more-juice">More Juice</h2>
<p>Many words have been written about the iPhone 12 battery life. It wasn’t that bad if you take the iPhone 11 out of the equation, but we were so spoilt by the 2019 versions that 2020 felt disappointing. Apple claimed it stayed similar, but it went from great down to just ok.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they have returned to greatness with the iPhone 13 Pro. Being on par with the 11 Pro, and in some cases much better. I have struggled to get lower than 40% left when going from 7am to 8pm, and power users shouldn’t struggle with achieving 5hours of regular usage with plenty left in the tank. It brings back a level of confidence that you will get through the day with very few issues.</p>
<p>The new A15 is touted as being responsible for most of these gains, with not just increased ability but also more efficiency cores. The iPhone is already overpowered for what is needed from a smartphone, but Apple still pushed forward and developed another step forward in its chips. The A15 has two performance and four efficiency cores so most of the time it will be idling along only using little power but ramp up when needed. Obviously, the iPhone 13 Pro will never miss a beat, no matter what you are doing, but neither did the two generations that went before it. The new 5 core GPU plays games and does everything you want with ease.</p>
<p>All the tech crammed into the iPhone 13 Pro helps maximise battery life. The performance and power saving ability of the A15 help, as does the updated screen, but the fact is the phone contains a bigger battery. The trade-off being an increase in weight from 187 grams to 203 grams which <em><em>is</em></em> considerable, and noticeable as soon as you pick the phone up. Only you will know if the trade-off is worth it to you — but just know that this isn’t magic giving you extra power through the day.</p>
<h2 id="super-shooter">Super Shooter</h2>
<p>Not all the heft can be attributed to a bigger battery thought, as the iPhone 13 Pro sports a much bigger camera housing and more protruding lenses. Thankfully, Apple are not hiding it away this year, and embracing the massive bulk because it once again provides the best camera in a smart phone.</p>
<p>You can hem and haw about Android this and that, but the reality is every year the new iPhone comes out the others play catch up. There is a lot to be said about the image processing producing a photo you like, but without sounding too much like a fan boy, Apple have constantly taken strides (or steps) forward each year with their cameras.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/75a5ad05f2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" /></figure>
<p>I am not sure that it is, as Apple say, the biggest camera update yet, but it is a big one. With all this said most people won’t be able to tell the difference in the images from any iPhone in the last 3 years but if you’re into the details it becomes obvious.</p>
<p>All three lenses have been updated and are the same across the Pro line up this year. The wide camera being the most obvious upgrade, featuring sensor shift stabilisation that only featured on its big brother last year, and improving to ƒ/1.5 aperture. Combined with bigger 1.9 µm pixels the sensor captures 47% more light, meaning images are not only more detailed in darker areas but also easier and quicker to capture.</p>
<p>The telephoto goes to ƒ/2.8 aperture, from ƒ/2.0 aperture but is 3x rather than 2x so don’t let that fool you. Allowing you to get in tighter to things that you can’t “zoom with your feet” and produces noticeably sharper images compared to previous models. I still feel a little like Apple <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/neglecting-the-telephoto/">neglects the telephoto</a> and still leans far too much on a cropped main sensor image in lower light than it should, but the improvements are noticeable and very welcome. I like using the telephoto to get closer to images without moving so I can shoot quicker, and the standard of image produces by the new telephoto is closer to the wide camera, but still not as good.</p>
<p>Another update is the Ultra-Wide, ridding itself of the terrible ƒ/2.4 aperture to a more usable ƒ/1.8 aperture. This is not a lens I use very often and find it a little too wide for creating anything other than arty alternative angles. However, when I do, the improvements are a huge step up. Shadows are much better and not as muddy with more detail retained. An improvement this vast might get me to use it a bit more.</p>
<p>To be honest my photography has truly little need for an angle as wide as the 13mm equivalent, but I might use the new macro mode. Get within 10cm of a subject the camera will switch to the wide angle in macro mode, allowing you to focus on subjects down to 2cm away. I remain reserved on the novelty wearing off, but it’s certainly great to have the option, even if the interface is a little confusing.</p>
<p>I got a little excited writing about the tech specs of the iPhone 13 Pro camera, but all of these won’t mean a thing to most users. What they will notice is the images are easier and quicker to capture than ever before giving you confidence that in almost any situation you will get the shot you want. Photographic Styles will also let you <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/28/how-to-use-iphone-13-photographic-styles/">tune your images</a> during capture to constantly get images that you will love every time.</p>

<h2 id="refreshed-screen">Refreshed Screen</h2>
<p>Finally, right! Whilst Android phones have been implementing higher refresh rates for several years, Apples phones have been rumoured but never received the attention they needed. The push back was that iOS mitigated the need for a refresh above 60hz, but as soon as you use anything better you begin to understand. ProMotion is not new, being in iPad Pro for quite some time, but makes the iPhone feel much more fluid.</p>
<p>It’s hard to tell when you first start using the device, as its more powerful too, but as soon as you go back you instantly feel it. The screen retains all of specs in iPhone screens we’ve seen for a few years, with a boost in the brightness of the screen up to 1,000nits, but the big story is ProMotion. The Apple tech used intelligently changes the screen refresh rate between 120hz down to 10hz when required. Saving your eyes, and your battery life.</p>
<p>This is one of those features that seems like it should have been done a long time ago. However, I trust that Apple waited for the tech to catch up and the battery life to not be affected too much. ProMotion is a nice to have feature, but not a necessity unless you use it and then unfortunately it has now ruined me for other phones.</p>

<h2 id="goldilocks">Goldilocks</h2>
<p>There is simply no denying that this year if you want the best of the best the iPhone 13 Pro is the phone to go for. It offers significant upgrades over the already improved ‘regular’ line up but most of which users won’t notice. It is undeniable that the £170 extra gets you a much more capable phone that it’s hard to turn down if you know what you are looking for.</p>
<p>The screen makes using the phone much smoother and enjoyable. The camera captures better images quicker and the battery gives you the confidence to do it all day. You will see loads of these in use over the next few months as people upgrade. Not because of these improvements but because it’s the new iPhone and that’s OK.</p>
<p>You don’t need to be into specs to get the benefits. The iPhone 13 Pro improves the lives of average users and the experience of power users. It’s a win-win.</p>

     <p>When the iPhone 12 launched I couldn’t <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/the-iphone-line/">make my mind up</a> which one of the all-new line up I wanted. Granted it was a weird year with different release dates, but in the end I ordered them all. Which was an interesting endeavour to see the real-world differences between using them. Most of which are not obvious from simply reading professional reviews. At the time I stuck on the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/iphone-pro-thoughts/">iPhone 12 Pro</a> which I called the Goldilocks phone, but throughout the year I switched between almost all models because I am weak.</p>
<p>They all had advantages and disadvantages. Despite all being great phones, almost all were the same old iPhone and didn’t do anything for me. All apart from <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/iphone-12-mini-wins/">the Mini version</a>. If you will allow me to quote myself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when I set my hands on the iPhone 12 Mini it sparked something in me that I have not felt for a while. It was the same old iOS device I love, but it was different for a change. A truly modern smartphone in a small package with pretty much nothing taken away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of those feelings are still strong, every time you handle the mini form factor. It does take a little getting used to, even more so if you’ve used larger phones, but there is much to be said about being able to reach the whole screen with one hand. Packing a 5.4″ screen, it’s only a fraction under the ones used on Plus sized phones in days gone by — but in a tiny little package. However you’re not going to be reading any books or scrolling through stuff for hours on this phone without some eye strain.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1c98f645b8.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" /></figure>
<p>The screen retains almost all of the specs from last years model, coming in at 476 ppi and the usual expected quality from Apple displays. Thankfully, it receives a boost in max brightness to 800nits, which only becomes apparent in bright sunshine, but it’s a welcome one. The iPhone 12 line struggled in some conditions despite its 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio and True Tone technology. Thankfully no such issues plague either iPhone 13 version. You’ll also get a smaller notch in the screen too, but if you notice it you’re paying more attention than I do.</p>
<p>Did I mention it’s small? Also light at only 140g, which rids me of the pinky pain that can strike with heavier phones. I know most phone reviews are written by individuals that have a few more years on me so are not bothered about carrying around a huge slab of glass, but for those of us more interested in having something more manageable, how great the phone is to use is already obvious from the words above.</p>
<p>Build quality is exactly what you would expect from a top-of-the-line smartphone from Apple. I am still extremely negative towards the flat sides of the newer iPhones, but thankfully the ‘regular’ line of iPhones lacks the polished stainless-steel edges, so they are more smudge resistant. Unfortunately, the back of my Midnight version is not! The black(ish) version this year is a very dark blue that is a lot lighter than expected, with the glass back showing handling marks constantly.</p>
<p>I usually shy away from spending too much time on the performance and ability of new iPhones. They have been faster and more powerful than users will ever need for some years now and that doesn’t change here. The A15 chip in all the new iPhones features improvements to last years A14 in both performance and battery life. I am sure you can find words about cores and GPUs in other places, but its hard to say anything about specs like this other than its great. Shrug emoji!</p>
<h2 id="big-shooter">Big Shooter</h2>
<p>The phone itself is ever so slightly thicker than last year, but you won’t notice it using the mini. Most of the heft is in the bigger camera system. One that takes the wide-angle lens that featured only on the iPhone 12 Max last year, combines it with what is, at first glance, the same ultra-wide from last year and puts it in a new diagonal set up.</p>
<p>The conspiracy theorist in me side eyes the slight tweak to the camera positioning as a way to signal your use of the new phone, but Apple claim they had to move it slightly to fit everything in. Which is an amazing achievement. I find it incredible that the camera lens and sensor shift stabilisation that <em><em>only</em></em> featured in the biggest phone last year makes its way to the smallest handset available. Bravo to Apple for not taking the easy way out.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/995bf38121.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" /></figure>
<p>What this means to users is that the new Wide sensor lets in 47% more light and keeps the sensors more stable than ever. The camera on the iPhone 13 is more confident than ever, providing faster capture, longer night mode shots and a better all-round experience than anything that I have used. Sure, not since the iPhone XS have I been disappointed in an iPhone camera update, but this one lives up to the hype.</p>
<p>The iPhone 12 cameras, particularly on the Pro, were excellent shooter, but tended to blow out highlights if you are not paying attention. When things got dark, night mode helped, but without having the steadiest hand in the world, images often left you with a water colour rather than a pin sharp shot. With the new camera system and more processing power the cameras take a big leap forward.</p>
<p>I can confidently wave the camera at almost any scene and get a great shot. Night mode needs around a second less in my testing to achieve better results than last year and shadows retain much more detail. Most people won’t notice the image improvements, because they were great before, but everyone will notice pictures are easy to take.</p>
<p>I would have loved this to also feature the new ƒ/1.8 aperture ultra-wide from the pro models (Apple do claim the ultra-wide lens is ‘faster’) but I can’t have everything I suppose. There’s also no macro mode from the pro models, but in my testing, this isn’t as good as it is made out to be. All in all this is a significant improvement all around. Perhaps not enough to warrant an upgrade from the iPhone 12, but one that will make even pixel peepers happy.</p>

<h2 id="big-cells">Big Cells</h2>
<p>The reality is I don’t use my phone all that much so When Apple introduced a mini version of an up-to-date smartphone it instantly grabbed my attention. The perfect handset for me. Well Almost. The iPhone 12 Mini lacked in battery life so badly that in the times I was away from home (few in 2020) it was always a concern — so I disappointingly went back to a regular 12 and sulked.</p>
<p>In fact, it was the biggest compliant I saw from other users, or potential buyers. The battery life was average, as long as you didn’t expect to use it like a big phone. This year, the Mini sports what Apple claim is 1.5 extra hours of battery life – which is only a useful stat if you have something to compare that too.</p>
<p>Apple figures are almost impossible to follow along with, and they use all sorts of figures to avoid telling you what to expect. In my testing the battery life is around 20% better than last year’s model. The iPhone 13 Mini lasts around as long as the iPhone 11, which is as Apple claim 17 hours of video playback.</p>
<p>In the real world I can easily use my phone for 3–4 hours (I did it for science) and still have around 40% left. However, I don’t have notifications on for anything other than phone calls, messages, and emails, and don’t use many apps outside of banking, Twitter, Instagram etc. The iPhone 13 Mini still won’t stand up to someone using their phone lots (or so-called power users) but this phone is not the appeal for those people.</p>
<p>I don’t have some anti-phone stance, but when I spend my days talking to my family, sat in a meeting with an iPad and Pencil or sat in front of an iMac the Mini is perfect. It fills the gaps I need it to but perhaps it won’t fill yours. It isn’t for everyone.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/30a6395493.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="585" /></figure>
<h2 id="less-is-more">Less Is More</h2>
<p>It’s not all good news though, because the small form factor has some downsides. Modern life seems to point most users towards a larger and larger device, so using a ‘smaller’ phone is not conductive to all tasks. I have small hands, to typing on the mini is great for me but everyone else I have shown it to struggles.</p>
<p>There is a cultural expectation to be small phone adverse which becomes apparent when people ask about your phone. Others use words like “too small for me” or “its tiny” when in fact it isn’t small at all. Many of them are already using phones that are marginally bigger, if at all, but the Mini feels much more compact than it is.</p>
<p>There is not much that can be said about the iPhone 13 Mini that isn’t summed up in a few words. It’s ultimately an iPhone so you know what you are getting, a top-of-the-line phone in a small package. The iPhone 13 Mini is an upgrade as if Apple went through the phone and ironed out the few, but large, issues from the iPhone 12 Mini. Meaning that it has stepped up in my estimations from a good phone to a great phone.</p>
<p>The iPhone 13 Mini is bigger than ever. Bigger camera, bigger battery and sporting a much bigger appeal. I can recommend this phone to other people now, and I think the iPhone 13 Mini will be the phone most people <em><em>should</em></em> buy, but they won’t.</p>

     <p>For the longest time I have been questioning why I do things. Not because I like making myself feel bad, although I am sure some people think I do, but because one of my biggest motivations is to ensure I get the most of my brief time on this earth. I want to make sure that when I am doing all the things I get up to, they are for me, and not falling for the same traps I see the world around me falling for.</p><p>This comes down to a lot of things. Social media usage, writing and photography are a few examples of things I enjoy for the intrinsic feelings I have. That’s not to say that I don’t receive, and enjoy, some extrinsic feedback from all these pursuits — and there is nothing wrong with that.</p><p>So why question all these things? Why not just enjoy them? Well <a href="https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2000_SchmuckKasserRyan_SIR.pdf">some research</a> indicates that our overall wellbeing is dramatically affected by the motivations why we do the things we do. In fact, lots of pursuits that out modern culture deems ‘normal’ could be detrimental to our mental health. Conclusions seem to indicate that the more you are driven by extrinsic values the more likely you are to become depressed and anxious.</p><p>Unfortunately, the modern world is much more driven by these external feedback loops than ever before. Leading to them to be termed ‘Junk Values’ due to their similar effects on the mind that junk food has on the body. Show off what you are doing to make people envious. Buy stuff to make you feel better and show off. All values that are hyper fixated on in modern western culture and ridiculously bad for your health.</p><h2 id="so-what-now">So What Now?</h2><p>So why does thins all matter to me? As much as I love posting things online and writing blog posts, and I am not going to lie on my deathbed and think about all the retweets I got or who liked my photos. I don’t want to miss anything in life for the wrong reasons and letting myself get away with <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/twitter-muscle-memory/">small steps</a> leads to bigger issues.</p><p>I have written many times about enjoying the process of writing more than the end results, and in fact the result causes me a considerable amount of anxiety because there is always an error I spot or some issue to solve. Yet I must keep some checks and balances in place to ensure things stay level.</p><p>You might notice breaks in my publishing, and social media posts because when I get to a point where <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/needing-feedback/">feedback is my focus</a> I need to step back. Indeed, when I write a post I am happy with that discusses a topic I am hoping to have some discourse around it, and it fails the natural things is to wonder why I bother. Which is letting these extrinsic needs take over why I am really doing the activity in the first place.</p><p>Taking photos that I want to take and posting them online is one thing but taking photos <em><em>just</em></em> to post online is another more dangerous activity. I have let my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/battling-your-ego/">ego in before</a> and won’t let it happen again. As with junk food, the effects are minimal in moderation, but start living on them and you will not only never be satisfied but also your health will suffer.</p><p>Unfortunately, we are surrounded by a world destined to promote these junk values. Valuing things on likes and retweets and living a <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/life-through-a/">life through a lens</a> to prompt envy in others. Consuming entertainment that plays on the worst parts of us all and surrounded by adverts telling us what we <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/when-are-you/">have is not enough</a>.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Patrick Tomasso in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq4xfqZCp6yt0Q_GcHY9AZg">iPhone 13 Pro review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Learn how to do the things you want to do instead of buying things hoping it will allow you to do the thing you want to do.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a bit of a joke among photographers the number of times people say to you something along the lines of “you take really good photos you must have a nice camera”. There is no response to this statement that allows people to grasp the stupidity in what they said other than handing them the camera and telling them to take some good photos.</p>
<p>Which is an arrogant thing to do. However, the fact remains that the camera is just a tool. Granted, <em>some</em> cameras can <em>sometimes</em> improve certain aspects in photos but the results are because of the person using the tool.</p>
<p>Which all the words are set up to lead me into saying the same thing Patrick says in his video. You don’t need to spend money to become a thing, you just need to learn the skills needed. You don’t need an iPhone 13 Pro to take better pictures no matter what Apple tells you in their marketing. The cameras are great, but they were great in the models that went before them. The most important thing is to keep taking photos and improving.</p>
<p>This appears in so many places in photography. The believed need to get a full frame camera, and new lens, loads of kit is all consumerism and nothing more. I am not pro, but I have improved so much using APSC cameras and ‘cheep’ lenses, and I still take rubbish pictures even with a ‘better camera’.</p>
<p>Concentrate on learning, not spending.</p>

     <p>This is so pro, and we think you’re really going to love it. Words that seem to flow out of every Apples executive at every mention of their top-of-the-line iPhone. Of course, we can argue for ever about what <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/what-is-an-iphone-pro/">Pro actually means</a> but when it comes to cameras, Apple talks a good talk in every press release. You can’t argue with the fact they walk far down the line of supporting those statements too, but for whatever reason just don’t seem want to give their users pro camera controls.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, you can achieve amazing things with the iPhone camera. In my opinion it is still the best smartphone camera to just point and shoot <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/samsung-galaxy-note/">the Note 20 Ultra</a> gets remarkably close.) and 90% of the iPhone users won’t care about this at all. They will carry on shooting shots on their iPhones and getting amazing results. However, for the few of us out there that want more control we are reliant on third party apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide-mark-ii-pro-camera/id885697368">Halide</a>, or just admit defeat.</p><p>Most of the controls needed are available in a sense. Users can tap on the screen to adjust the general exposure of an image and use a slider for a bit control over the image. Focus can be changed slightly and even locked with another tap(s) on the screen although and minute control is not allowed, and the camera interface also lacks any kind of influence over shutter speed. Something that becomes immediately obvious once you want to use Night Mode, but the option appears and disappears what seems to be randomly.</p><h2 id="f-stopped">F-Stopped</h2><p>All in all this is fine. As said most users won’t even need these kinds of options, and that’s why they are missing. However, it can get frustrating when Apple makes a big deal about what aperture their lens are and grade the amount of fake background blur achievable in Portrait Mode in f/stops yet give you absolutely no control over this in camera, it’s all fixed. I love the fact that the new iPhone 13 Pro’d wide camera can go down as low as f/1.5 but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to shoot at f/8 sometimes!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/ad1828a947.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>Perhaps I am missing something. It is possible that Apple have thrown so much stuff into its very confused camera interface that I have missed out on learning new tricks. Indeed, I didn’t realise I could lock focus until I wanted an Instagram reel a few days ago. With that said, even because the expose control exists doesn’t mean it is easy to use, or that I know what is changing in camera. Shutter speed or ISO, both of which I want to be able to control myself. Undeniably Pro photographers take <a href="https://austinmann.com/trek/iphone-13-pro-camera-review-tanzania">amazing shots with them</a> all the time, but for an Oh So Pro Camera, it’s not as pro friendly as it should be.</p><p>The solution if you really want pro controls, and I think any solution Apple would point too, is third party apps. I use Lightroom, with a quick launch option as a widget, but many others rely on the awesome app <a href="https://lux.camera">Halide</a>. The argument could be made that the team behind Halide are doing a ‘better job’ than Apple in pushing the iPhone (and iPad) camera boundaries and <a href="https://lux.camera/iphone-13-pro-camera-preview-the-hardware-changes/">informing its users</a> that want more out of their photos. Granted, again this is going to be a ridiculously small percentage of their users. Leaning on a third-party system is fine for a more robust reminders system, or a new email app but falls down a little for such an integrated part of your smartphone such as taking pictures. At least until Apple allow me to set a default camera app and support it properly.</p><p>Instead, the solution is that the time has come for Apple to really put its money where its mouth. To deliver a pro interface to go with its pro camera set up. Most third-party apps do a wonderful job at imitating the stock camera app and making it feel more ingrained with the system, but if Samsung can build nice pro controls into its app, so can Apple. Oh, and add on a <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/the-iphone-needs/">camera button</a> while you’re at it.</p><p>Edited at 16:19: I had not realised the aperture was fixed on Apple lenses, which makes sense.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Federico in his <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-mini-review-small-wonder/">iPad Mini review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The new iPad mini has no such aspirations. Instead, the iPad mini flips the iPad Pro aesthetic on its head and asks: what if the iPad Pro’s industrial design, with its focus on gestures and the display, could also work in a tablet that is unashamedly portable and designed to be held at all times, rather than propped up on a keyboard?
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of the huge points that I have failed to articulate. Not since the first iPad Pro have I picked up a device and instantly been convinced it will change everything.</p>
<p>Not because it’s small, and light – it is obviously. But because it’s not trying to be an iPad Pro at all. There is no keyboard for me to buy and no lofty aspirations that I should be using it for ‘real work’. It’s just an iPad.</p>
<p>One I can throw in my bag and take anywhere. Read in bed and catch up on my favorite tv shows whilst sitting in the car. Whilst indeed the iPad Air is not too much more expensive it feels like a cheaper iPad Pro. Whereas the mini is just what I need as an accompanying device to everything else I have. I could do all these things on a bigger iPad, or a bigger phone, but I don’t want to.</p>
<p>This isn’t a device for everyone, but it’s perfect for me.</p>

<p>When it comes to using your tech, there are few better feelings than slapping on a new wallpaper and feeling like you’ve got a brand-new phone. Being able to add in a high resolution backing to all your apps overtime you unlock your phone or tablet that shows of your personality sometimes takes a lot of thinking about. However, the new update to <a href="https://thewallpaperapp.com">The Wallpaper App</a> is the only tool you’ll ever need.</p>
<p>Version two from indie dev Ben Harroway, speaker at WWDC 2019 and the brains behind <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/noisy-book/id1474786858">Noisy Book App</a> takes the already great app to a new level. I expected nothing less because when Ben produces apps he delivers in spades, with the second version packed full of customisable stunning wallpapers for iOS.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3773" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bb48c81e18.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="267" /></p>
<p>One the day when some will be receiving their brand new iPhone 13, you can transform your current phone with a few taps. With a simple interface of taps and swipes you can scroll through the huge inventory of designs in-which you wont struggle to find something that takes your fancy. But don’t think this is just a glorified gallery. The Wallpaper App also allows you to customise all the designs to your liking. With almost infinite combination of design tweaks available along with the ability to personalised colours.</p>
<p>So it doesn’t matter if you’re addicted to dark mode, need something bright and beautiful to cheer you up or are looking for a cool live wallpaper to show off to your friends, the version 2 update to the Wallpaper App has it all. I’ve Downloaded loads of them already for both my phone and iPad and you’d be hard push to no fill up a large part of your storage with gorgeous wallpapers – for £1.99 it’s an absolute bargain. #Notsponsored</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Every time Apple update something in their line-up that doesn’t quite live up to people’s expectations the finger pointing starts. Words like “incremental”, and the lack of “innovation” start being banded around along with the “should have been an S year statements”. I don’t agree with these statements in relation to the iPhone 13, however even if that is the case for you, these small steady steps forward are the best thing for everyone.</p>
<p>I struggle with the urge to upgrade more than most people. I obsessively get a new iPhone each year (yes even the iPhone XS) and more than occasionally <a href="https://gr36.com/2020/11/21/the-iphone-line/">look back and regret it</a>. Each year the new phones indeed offer me something, however small, but I have come to terms with the fact that the drive for me to upgrade is one of habit and ego. When it comes to the device <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/08/26/minimalism-and-big-phones/">I use the most</a> I just like something new, constantly. The sheer fact that I buy the pro phone each year is because it is new but being mindful of this allows me to see just how truly stupid it is.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3768 size-large" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/97c1b8a097.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p>This so called “lack of innovation” or “incremental updates” are exactly what our consumerist culture needs. Small updates each year help to dispel the myth of needing to constantly upgrade. Indeed, the actual benefits of newer models are becoming so small that when talking to others it is easier to put people off than ever. Leaving room for you to question the line up and be far more objective about <a href="https://gr36.com/2019/03/20/over-stretching-to-upgrade/">stretching to upgrade</a>. A positive further enforced by a line-up that contains overlapping features and, at least perceivably, very few compromises at each price point.</p>
<p>Sure, there are more capitalist ideas behind releases than I want to think about. There must be technical reasons but simple things such as moving camera lenses to new positions could be interpreted as making sure to show off the new phone. You can be sure each year there is also a new flagship colour too. However, a line up where you can get 90% of a phone at 70% of the cost is one that I applaud. Long may small incremental updates keep coming and someday even I might not feel the urge to buy, but I doubt it.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Very few times in my blogging life do I have to go extremely far back in my archives. Perhaps a year so to reference in newer posts but usually not far at all. Today I had to go right back to 2016 where I urged people <a href="https://gr36.com/2016/10/09/please-dont-put/">not to put a computer on their face</a>. Of course, referencing the now infamous<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass"> Google Glass</a> which had been floating around for a few years previously, but at the time the latest thing was Snapchat Glasses.</p>
<p>As I said previously, there are few things that <em>really</em> worry me when it comes to technology but being surrounded by other people’s recording devices on their face is chilling. Without doubt the improvements made to smartphones, particularly cameras have helped the world at least feel a bit safer. If you’re in any doubt you can pull out your smartphone and record what is going on. The effect being a small degradation of privacy with a positive benefit to life. Whereas Google Glass and Snapchat glasses felt like more than a step too far.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was like reliving the past when <a href="https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/388482975992028/">Zuckerberg lauded up their latest innovation</a> along with esteemed Sunglasses brand Ray-Ban. They not only look pretty much the same as the Snapchat version, but with a much premium build quality, they are also set out to achieve the same thing – record as much of your life as possible. It’s at this point I start to think if I right in the thoughts I have about a product or am I just a grumpy old man that doesn’t ‘get it’. As much as I hate the approach of <a href="https://gr36.com/2019/07/06/life-through-a/">Living life through a lens</a>, I must accept that that this is just how the world works now; but putting it on your face just doesn’t sit well with me.</p>
<p>I am pleased to see that thought has been placed on some of the privacy issues. An LED light when recording or taking an image at least instills some confidence in me that I am not being recorded all the time. Facebook of all people have thought about the push backs that people had against previous attempts to face computers and implemented safety as best they could. Sure, it doesn’t take much to stop the LED from working or cover it over, but this is less likely with you are stumping up <a href="https://www.ray-ban.com/uk/electronics/RW4003%20UNISEX%20ray-ban%20stories%20%7C%20round-black/8056597489645">at least £300 for a pair</a>. Indeed, I do question if a pair of Ray-Bans on their face say more about the intended use than cheap plastic Snapchat ones? However, that is not only amazingly pretentious to say, but is also difficult to draw conclusions from.</p>
<p>Some technology I just don’t understand, and Face computers are one of the things I will never get. This is because the product is not for me, it’s for people that want to capture more things. Which in today’s world feels more understandable than it did even 5 years ago. I have no issues <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/07/29/having-a-camera/">holding up a camera</a> to take pictures, and I feel much more comfortable with people having to do the same. Indicating to me that my image is being recorded and making it easier for me to protest should I need to. We do indeed live in a world full of cameras, so camera glasses and no doubt AR ones are unavoidable. It’s weird that Facebook have allowed me to be at least a little more accepting of them, but I still have hope that they don’t take off.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>OK. Hear me out before you reply and do as Twitter says and read the post before commenting. The bottom line is, I don’t believe all the things in the post, but I do find it interesting to think about in the age of the modern web. Throwing around ideas and then debunking them in your own mind is a good exercise for finding truth when people are trying to deceive you — like they are on Twitter.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago I was introduced to a conspiracy theory that at first glance seems pretty out there. As with all of them, you’re never quite sure if people actually believe it or are just messing with others. The basis of the idea is that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/08/dead-internet-theory-wrong-but-feels-true/619937/">the internet died five years ago</a>. Most, if not all, of the human created content you see online is populated by artificial intelligence and all the actual humans are gone.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If you search the phrase i hate texting on Twitter and scroll down, you will start to notice a pattern. – Kaitlyn Tiffany, The Atlantic
</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems out there doesn’t it. However, how many people on Twitter do you really know? Like in person know, a handful, more? As a percentage of the total people you follow I’ll bet it’s low — well all the others could be AI bots couldn’t they. Sounds bonkers, but when you consider that <a href="https://ppcprotect.com/blog/ad-fraud/how-many-of-the-internets-users-are-robots/">the PPC estimates</a> that in 2020 at least 37.2% of all internet users were robots, and in 2016 they were responsible for <a href="https://www.imperva.com/blog/bot-traffic-report-2016/">52% of the web traffic</a>. Suddenly you start looking at the people you follow on Twitter with a side eye.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t take much to fool us. There are already bots <a href="https://medium.com/@dateaha/spot-the-bot-keep-bots-from-taking-over-on-dating-sites-6fe64e445dc0">pretending to want to date you</a>, pretending to be helpful <a href="https://uk.niceincontact.com/call-center-solutions/digital-customer-service/customer-support-bot">customer service assistants</a>, and much more besides. It wouldn’t take much artificial intelligence to tweet interesting things often enough for us to follow them.</p>
<p>What about other interaction I hear you all say. What about the blog posts, photos, and perhaps even videos that they also post online? The unwelcome news is that other content is pretty easy to fake too. Remember <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/06/tech/tom-cruise-deepfake-tiktok-company/index.html">Tom Cruise playing golf</a>? Ask yourself if that person you follow, interact with, and look up to <em>could</em> be fake and the answer is usually a high possibility.</p>
<p>Of course, this conspiracy theory goes much deeper into talking about the agendas of those that control the bots and the “various corporations that are in cahoots with the government to control our thoughts”. Which at this point I am surprised there isn’t some lizard people involved. However, let’s not forget that operations by organisations have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/technology/russia-troll-farm-election.html">proven to influence</a> not only election results but also general feelings around sensitive subjects. There isn’t much of a leap to suggest that corporations and more ‘friendly’ governments are using similar tactics.</p>
<p>I think you would be surprised how many bots you interact with daily, and these kinds of topics are interesting to think about. Then again, I could be a bot and this is simply to distract you from what is really going on!</p>

     <p>Before I start, the full disclosure is I don’t think this error message makes much difference. After resolving this I have not noticed any improvements with image handling, but some-people (me included) just like clearing warning messages!

Also note that the module is optional and not required, to reinforced what I have said previously I have noticed zero difference and merely did it to get rid of the warning – do so at your own risk.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It is with great sadness that I announce the death of a good friend of yours. The Greg Thinks Thing newsletter sadly passed away in its sleep because of neglect. It has a good run, reaching the ripe on age of fifty-two editions, and leaves behind much of its content in the form of blog posts ‘retconned’ into my blog as if it has always been there.</p>
<p>But seriously it’s gone. I tried my best to keep it going but since <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/07/27/be-happy-it/">no more working from home</a> and more blogging going on, I just don’t have the time to write it. Many of the resent things I tried to write specifically for the newsletter felt forced, or rehashes of blog posts so I will leave this excellent platform to those more suiting of sending things straight to your email inbox.</p>
<p>It served a great purpose though. I sailed along at the boom time when everyone and their pet hamster had a newsletter and wrote more during what was a tough time for me and my family due to COVID and national lockdown(s). It gave me something extremely specific to aim for and make sure that despite everything going on around me I published something very personal and got a lot of things off my chest. Sending them to people that <em>really</em> wanted to read them.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3694 size-large" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6a46ab2762.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p>Which brings me to a larger point about the purposes of the things that I do. Newsletters started off very personal things, sent straight to us directly without messing about online. Like a direct message from a friend filled with thoughts and ideas. However, this has changed, newsletters are now a massive industry with top notch writing that is only available through email. Often linked to more controversial publishing Substack has also managed to gather up some writers that want to stand on their own and publish exclusive things only to the people that want to read them. Hiding everything away unless you pay for it.</p>
<p>Whereas I want the opposite. I have fallen back in love with writing again and long may it continue to bring my joy. I want people to get my thoughts however they want. Social Media, RSS, reading apps and there are even service out there like Mailbrew that will package it back up to an email if that’s your preferred method. Reading and writing is the most important thing for me, and the small thoughts that maintained more than fifty editions of my newsletter will just be blog posts now.</p>
<p>Thank you to those that read the editions. Or didn’t, you just signed up and that was enough. I enjoyed writing them immensely but it’s time to focus on different things and let those that can write better than I take you money and ping your inbox.</p>

     <p>How do you write a follow up post? Especially one where you’ve <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/my-glass-half-full/">changed your mind</a> just because someone on the internet said you should have stuck it out? Or do you avoid writing it at all and just hide away in blissful ignorance. Those are questions for other days, but today I <em>will</em> write it because I <em>did</em> change my mind and return to using <a href="https://glass.photo">Glass</a> and I am glad I did.</p><p>I did the same thing with Hey — the now divisive email app — and flip flopped around before diving in for a year. <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/08/16/glass-thoughts/">Glass</a> is different though, I don’t really know what to do with it but I can’t leave it because it just looks so good. I missed looking at the awesome photographs in one of the best designed apps I have used for a long time. It was simply the lack of being able to find such an enjoyable experience anywhere else that lead me to begrudgingly stump up the £25 entrance fee <a href="https://glass.photo/gr36/1E9mo3orrGY0IsUmVfENpU">and post a photo</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/bb6111f61b.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>I don’t want to write about Instagram again, because all those words have been said. Yet the lack of every other existing service is the very reason I was pushed again to Glass. As much as the lack of interaction on my photos was annoying, and the same appearance of the photos I saw is still true using a different service with different aims takes a change in mindset.</p><p>I don’t want Glass to be another social media service where I follow everyone that I know (obviously I will do) I want it to be something different. I just want to look at nice photos that people are proud off and at the moment Glass is chocked full of them.</p><p>As everyone posts their best photos from their highlights and no doubt catches up with all the great photos, they have taken over the years I am impressed by the standard of shots. In fact, I am almost embarrassed to post some of mine, because they don’t feel up to the excellent standard of those I am scrolling past.</p><p>I have deleted so many photos that I thought were great at the time, and fine on Instagram – but now I am playing photographer I am not so sure!</p>

We’re each lonely individuated language machines, pumping out words (no matter what they are) for a far-off “audience” to easily digest. We mentally live in the future where we’re successful and recognized, instead of the present moment where real creation happens.</p></blockquote>
<p>A spent much of this post nodding along to the thoughts on difference in writing for money and just for yourself. I’ve never been one to try and build a brand, or I’m rubbish at it, I am not sure which — but needing to write posts for money seems like it would suck.</p>
<p>The platform issues that Matt talks about a side, the reality is that you must now constantly churn out the ‘content’ your readers want or that overseers dictate. This changes the whole communication objective. Very quickly becoming stale and removing much of the social aspects that are enjoyable about of writing a post on the internet anyway. Pushing out words to tick boxes and make other people happy instead of asking questions and starting conversations.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Try as I might to be a good minimalist, I get <a href="https://gr36.com/2019/12/16/losing-minimal/">lost along the way</a> every now and again. I am never sure if I am doing this right, not spending too much time on taking instruction or being aware of how others deal with things. Yet there is one thing that I see constantly around those that title themselves minimalists and that is their aversion to technology and particularly phones with big screens.</p>
<p>I don’t use minimalism as a destination. I am not as crazed as some people that visit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/">the sub Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/pbet1x/the_tshirt_debacle/">constantly worry</a> about ridding themselves of more stuff, I just like having less things. What I do have, and what I do, gets some thought put into it and I only purchase what I really need in my life.</p>
<p>When it comes to tech, I love new things. I can’t help it, it’s my one weakness, and at this point I have given up fighting it. I spend quite a lot of my life online for my job and enjoy using my phone more than most minimalists would let themselves and I am perfectly happy with that. To me, my life is about making informed choices, being aware when those are being <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory/">taken away from me</a> and being willing to take a step back when needed. Which brings me to my feelings towards using big phones.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3565 size-large" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2749254c38.jpg" width="700" height="700" /></p>
<p>Hey look, you do you, but I used to give myself a tough time whenever I used one (that doesn’t sound like me at all does it). Sure, a smaller phone in general <a href="https://gr36.com/2017/07/16/a-smaller-phone/">makes me much happier</a>, but when you put thought into a purchase and having something bigger adds value to you, these feelings shouldn’t exist.</p>
<p>I constantly think about the people that worry themselves silly because they feel that minimalism means they must have less and less at the detriment of themselves. These is no end point, or goal to achieve, simply some rough things for you to think about whenever you think about bringing new things into your life. Being mindful of the things that you do, and the things that you buy to ensure you get the most amount of value possible. If a bigger screen on a phone does that for you, or I, then that’s great.</p>
<p>I have flaws in the way I approach tech <a href="https://gr36.com/2020/11/21/the-iphone-line/">in lots of ways</a>. I am mindful of the way it can manipulate me, but also open to new way of looking at things. I like having a bigger phone because it is one of the devices, I use the most. I communicate on it for my job, my personal life and I write much of my blog on it. Couple this with the fact my eyesight isn’t what it was, and a bigger phone just gives me more value and I am sure it would do for others too.</p>
<p>I wrote many of these thoughts as a process for myself to understand why I am thinking about getting a max when then new iPhones come around but feel free to use these as your own excuse to not feel bad.</p>

     <p>It’s hard work writing all the time. Some people seem to find it impressively easy and set off my imposter syndrome constantly. Yet for the most of us having the inspiration and then sitting down and actually writing the thing can become a mammoth task. Even more so when you do it constantly as there are so many things in life that can get in the way. When a friend of mine asked recently how I write so much, I looked bemused because I don’t write that much really. Not much that sees the light of day anyway, but perhaps my targets are much more than others.</p><p>There is no easy fix for publishing. A lot of the time you simply have to get out of your own way, and stop trying to fulfil demands you can’t meet. Everyone has big ideas, and can promise themselves, and others, to meet a level that they think they need to. However life always has a habit of getting in the way, and being present in the day to day things is more important that staring at your computer urging yourself to write something.</p><p>My writing comes and goes. At the moment I am publishing more regularly, but I am not worried when at points I don’t have much time to sit down and write something to publish. I don’t put pressure on myself to achieve certain levels, Mainly because I don’t make any money from my blog despite a few adverts and despite the fact that I like people on the web, my personal life is much more important to me.</p><p>I make loads of mistakes. Typos galore, and my grammar is never up to some many peoples standard (I have been turned down for so many writing positions it’s crazy) but that’s OK. Despite my imposer syndrome I have gotten used to just hitting publish and not worrying about it.</p><p><a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/sitting-in-the/">Sitting In The Chair</a> is my most important, and most read, bit of advice to date. Simply writing stuff is the key to publishing more online. Much of what I write day to day is for me, formulating thoughts, recording things and linking ideas together. This could be journalling, putting things into <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/journaling-with-day/">Day One</a>, or making <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/using-craft-for/">daily notes</a>, the most important thing is that you (and I) are writing things out.</p><p>It might sound like a meaningless tautology, but the reason I write so much is because I write so much — and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/this-is-how/">you should too</a>.</p>

     <p>The two week free trial I had in place for <a href="https://glass.photo">Glass</a> comes up for renewal today and I am really conflicted. To the point where I think I might sit and wait for a bit before jumping in. Granted the cost is only £26 for a year currently, so what I stand to loose is minimal — but what I stand to gain isn’t exactly much either.</p><p>I stand by much of the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/glass-thoughts/">thoughts I had originally</a> in that I do really like the way it works. The founders of the company really seem to want to make something great for photographers, and I trust them to stay stead fast on their founding aim to avoid all of the social trappings spoken about when pitching the app. However my worry is I just want anything but Instagram and this is just the latest in a long line of attempts to replace it.</p><p>These thoughts on getting into yet another social platform do not happen in a vacuum either. Since diving back into <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/having-a-camera/">taking pictures</a> I have been thinking about what kind of pictures I like to take and also why I enjoying taking pictures in the first place. Worry isn’t the right word to use, but I certainly think about who I take photos for and why I share them. The words I use to describe it can have lots of delusions of grandeur. Using words like “artistic” and “self expression” when in reality they could simply be to try and make me look cool on the internet.</p><h2 id="a-bit-of-validation">A Bit Of Validation</h2><p>I havn’t quite found my ‘thing’ yet and as such take very varied photos, and the reality is I want other people to like them. They are taken as much for me as they are other people and I do worry constantly about making them good enough to share because they are important to me. James Popsys talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/FffEPQqGDPc?t=106">making his photos</a> <em>about</em> something, not just <em>of</em>something. Which really speaks to me when I start to think about capturing a split second of a scene and try to tell the story of why I took that image. Composing a story in one split second when the world around is constantly changing is like meditation to me.</p><p>But with all this fluffiness going on, turns out I like my images being validated and Glass doesn’t do that for me. I know this is the whole reason the platform was built, and I agree with its goal but maybe I just don’t need that at this point in my journey. I have a sinking feeling that my photos are not good enough when compared with the smaller number but higher percentage of actual photographers on Glass and they just disappear into the app.</p><p>When I scroll through the app, the people I follow are also very minimal. Many of those that flocked to the app have fallen off already, with many more to follow once the end of their two weeks trial arrives. In which case I may be left with a ghost town of dead accounts and photos that all seem to look the same.</p><p>Although they are improving things slowly the discovery is not where I want it to be, and the resultant people to follow list features loads of people that take the same kind of pictures and offer me very little in return. Invites are specificity being shared with a more diverse pool of photographers currently but even that doesn’t seem to have moved the needle yet. It doesn’t have much to do with diversity, but everything to do with an iPhone only, invite only barrier to entry — which <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/intentional-barriers/">could be intentional</a>.</p><p>I knew this newness would wear off, and I knew that I had reservations right from the start. Don’t mistake this post for a full on trashing as I still think that in the long run apps like this are needed – I just don’t think it is for me currently. Turns out I quite like getting a few likes.</p><p>Update: Follow up <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/refill-my-glass/">here</a> where I changed my mind and went back!</p>

<blockquote><p>Although I wouldn’t go as far as saying I entirely dislike them, I feel I could experience much better and healthier communities and technologies than those I have found on the likes of Instagram and Twitter.</p></blockquote>
<p>I completely get this feeling. I am constantly looking for somewhere where I fit in and people share the same outlook as me, and because of the way most social platforms work they all suck. They seem to all want my attention, want to force conversations on me, and don’t do enough to grow communities on them. [[Social Media In 2021]]</p>
<p>I love Twitter, and that’s part of the problem. Yet I always get this sinking feeling when I use it for a bit. A feeling of dread, doom and stress instead of interacting with like minded people. Yet I have to still us it, not least because my brain won’t let me quit it [[twitter-muscle-memory]], but more for the (at least fleeting) feeling that I am being social.</p>
<p>I’ve tried micro.blog and although the people on there are lovely, if your face doesn’t fit or you opinions on things are different it can suck. Mainly because the people are all pretty similar. [[bye-micro-blog]] However I am convinced that the smaller, paid for communities are the answer it is just a matter of how to find them.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In case you’ve switched off, or reading my blog for the first time, you will have noticed that I am struggling to use social media in all of its forms – but <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/07/09/a-quick-check/">particularly Twitter</a>. The <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/04/11/time-to-slow/">constant moving nature</a> of the service, coupled with its instance on surfacing the very worst of that constantly flowing information, leaves me feeling exhausted and upset at the world. Sometimes it feels impossible to keep up with all that is going on and that’s because I simply don’t need to.</p>
<p>Social media puts millions of people in front of our face every minute of everyday. Meaning that you can easily communicate with more people than ever before in human history. The bad news is, they can also communicate with you, and the noise can become too much very quickly. Filtering out the noise and getting to the important things easily is one of the most useful skills to learn if you want to live on the web, and lets be honest in this day and age <a href="https://gr36.com/2020/08/09/i-cant-go/">you have to</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What may seem interesting and important now may be completely irrelevant and uninteresting in a few days. – <a href="https://bagerbach.com/blog/how-i-process-inputs-from-the-internet/">Christian Bager Bach Houmann</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The millions of people in front of you can lure you into a false sense of what is important. If 1% of Twitter gets upset at something that’s million of people, but if 1% of your fiends did it wouldn’t be important at all. Without constant mindful thought, the large scale of social media can dangerously push you down rabbit holes to taking in information that simply doesn’t matter. It has a habit of portraying a false senses of importance and urgency towards topics that in very short order become unimportant. However it is only you that can decide what is <em>really</em> important to you.</p>
<p>I find that saving things to read later helps a lot, allowing me to delete articles that no longer interest me when I get around to catching up. Leaving some space between discovery and reaction often dulls the urgency felt to topics and also allows me to get a much fuller picture of what actually goes on. Only then will I try and formulate my thoughts on topics that matter, often in the form of a new note in <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/05/15/my-obsidian-set/">Obsidian</a>.</p>
<p>Writing about the things that matter and the things that I learn is huge. This doesn’t have to be blogging, although <a href="/2021/03/01/this-is-how.html">that would be great</a>, but just writing something down is key. mUch like having a second brain for tasks — journaling, making notes in a system, or starting a full on <a href="/2021/05/15/my-obsidian-set.html">knowledge tree</a> will help to filter noise and has the added benefit of helping to retain much more important information.</p>
<p>The constant need to publish all of our half baked thoughts to anyone that will listen is not a new idea. It has existed almost as long as humans have existed. The only things that has changed is the scope of communication and the availability of the platforms. The <a href="https://gr36.com/2020/09/09/its-not-the/">internet is not to blame</a> for the pressure we all feel, but some simple things do help with cutting down the noise. Being clear about the things that really matter and being aware when you are being sold something different is key.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Seth Godin on being <a href="https://seths.blog/2021/08/in-it-for-the-money/">In it for the money</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s such a hard thing to be honest about. Because money is tied into status, possibility, self-worth, connection, sustenance and more. How many people would be doctors if being a doctor was something you couldn’t get paid for?</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people spout similar things about not working if you love what you do blah blah blah. I mean, its true that if you can find something you love then it doesn’t feel like work, but the world just doesn’t work like people on Linkedin seem to think it does.</p>
<p>Anyway. Who on earth should work for free on anything? Even if you love what you do and don’t get paid for it (like<a href="https://gr36.com/2021/02/08/asking-giving-and/"> my blogging</a> in some part) you should be rewarded for it if you are providing some value. There are enough people trying to get things <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/forexposure/">for exposure</a>, or companies trying to to employ loads of free interns without all this nonsense.</p>
<p>Seth uses this post to pose some interesting questions about payment for simple things and the value of what people are doing, but providing value to others for no reward is dumb.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would you more trust a reviewer who jumps apps as often as they change clothes or one who hasn’t changed app in years? The one who always changes probably is probably too interested in novelty over real usefulness, but the long term user might be too stuck in their ways.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have been thinking a lot about reviews lately as I <a href="/2021/07/29/having-a-camera.html">dive back into cameras</a> and lust after about a million different lenses. Over the past year I have begun to have a thick layer of distrust against almost anyone doing reviews. YouTube especially has gone from being an invaluable resource when researching into a purchase, to something that provides very little value.</p>
<p>This isn’t just tech. It’s cameras, cars, days out, almost every company trying to sell you stuff has infiltrated the world of online reviews and it’s a pain. Unless I know the reviewer or the person making the video I find myself having to watch multiple people saying almost exactly the same thing until I switch off. I get the need for income if you want to ‘make it big’ and I know a lot of people watch these kinds of videos as entertainment, but when I am trying to research something now I am a bit stuck.</p>

     <p>It is really hard for me to form thoughts on new services as quickly as I would like. My initial excitement usually dulls in very quick order but not before I have shelled out some cash to use it. As much as I never think anyone wants to read my thoughts when there are far more <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/13/glass">popular takes</a>, I do have a few things to say about photography apps.</p><p>Since reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781847942548">No Filter</a> last year I have been a little sad. The excellent behind the scenes story of Instagram from founding to acquisition made me miss the service even more. I am still filled with a longing for the old Insta days, unfortunately one that I know couldn’t exist today. It’s hard to believe that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/20/instagram/?guccounter=1">just 10 short years ago</a> Instagram was the popular up and coming app with all the buzz, but a decade is a long time on the internet and things change.</p><p>The modern version is 5 or 6 different things crammed into one app, and removes exactly what Instagram is for. This, understandably, has left <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5FHv0g0agg">many photographers</a> out in the cold and a little bitter considering how much work they have put into the service over the last decade. So many have been looking for something new. In recent memory the app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/gala-creativity-welcomed/id1560876288">Gala</a> arrived and <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1421159556571353089?s=20">looked promising</a> but ultimately failed to keep my attention.</p><h2 id="a-little-different">A Little Different</h2><p>Glass is different though. It is set up as an anti Instagram and removes all of the foils that entrap almost anything that Facebook touches. The app is designed to display the photographs beautifully, removing almost all engagement traps. Likes, follower counts and a constant strive for influence is replaced by a constant stream of the latest images uploaded.</p><p>The design focuses on the images themselves and the details of them. Displaying privacy conscious EXIF data about the image giving you an insight into exactly how the image was shot. You get to not only see the images, but feel the desire behind them, if your a photographer of course and know your shutter speed from your aperture.</p><p>My first log in allowed me to follow a few people that I knew already, but also find others that took the kind of images I like to see and learn from. As an amateur shooter being able to peek behind the curtain and understand how a shot was made proves a great learning angle too.</p><h2 id="glass-intentions">Glass Intentions</h2><p>The founders talk a great talk, and seem to be walking exactly as then intended. When <a href="https://om.co/2021/08/10/glass/">talking to Om Malik</a> they sold the service well and aimed it to fulfill exactly what I and many photographers were hoping for.</p><p>We’ve intentionally avoided any public counts. We don’t want Glass ever to become a popularity contest. We’re not home for influencers. We are a home for photographers. – Tom Watson, founder of Glass</p><p>There is zero counting and metrics going on. No followers (well I guess you could count them yourself if you want to), no hashtags and best of all no likes. I want that rush of dopamine as much as the next person, but double tapping is far too easy. Where as in Glass if you like a photo the only choice you have is to leave a comment, which feels much better.</p><p>With these metrics gone there is no algorithm at play currently. I am sure if the app grows there will be no choice but to tweak this slightly, for the risk of becoming unmanageable. Glass is no where near reaching <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/the-problem-of/">a scale that needs more though putting into it</a>, but only time will tell. I do fear that they will eventually feel the pain of volume, however with zero metrics there would be no point gaming the system anyway.</p><p>Which in short means that my trust in getting into the app feels very well placed currently. They have spoken publicly about the very straight forward way you are able to get your photos back out again should you wish to leave, which is also great. The iOS only limit also seems to be lifting with Android and web versions in the works, so hopefully everyone can join very soon.</p><h2 id="paying-for-it">Paying For It</h2><p>However. Saying things like “We believe great photography can come from anywhere and anyone” is fine. But the anyone is only those that can stump up the £50 a year entrance fee. Don’t get me wrong I love the fact that paying money to support a service means none of the bad stuff that comes from free services. However the worry would be that Glass becomes just another service along side all the others.</p><p>If I want as many people as possible to see my shots then I have no choice but to post them every where else too. So when the next years subscription comes around am I willing to pay again to look at photos posted by others everywhere else too?</p><h2 id="reservations-prevail">Reservations Prevail</h2><p>My answer is probably yes, but the true telling will be how many people stick around in in a few months time. A <a href="https://gabz.org/2021/08/15/things-i-love.html">few</a> <a href="https://chrishannah.me/glass-a-new-photo-sharing-app/">of my</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbirchler/status/1426920735113629696?s=20">friends</a> share similar feelings towards the new hotness app but I might have to cross my fingers and hope. Following high profile shooters is one thing, but I would like a mix of people I know.</p><p>As the opening few sentences gave way to a flood of my opinions I am still very bearish on the future. I can’t tell people how good a service is until I have used it for <a href="https://chrisjwilson.me/2021/08/06/how-do-you.html">more than 14 days</a>, and more so for a service that costs money and isn’t for everyone. My hope is that the grand plans for Glass keep on track and achieve even more, but my worry is the new hotness burns out and we all skulk back to Instagram again.</p>

     <p>I am sure I will keep going on about it, and also spam my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gr36m/">Instragram</a> now, but having a camera back is a great feeling. I am no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3DkFux8Iv-aYnTRWzwaiBA">Peter McKinnon</a> but to try and build my skills as much as possible I have been watching loads of YouTube, and one point in particular has struck a cord with me and applies to so much of life.</p><p>James Popsys discuses some <a href="https://youtu.be/RXO2dcWg_G0?t=441">tips for beginner photographers</a>, not the usual shutter speed and ISO stuff, but actual practice advice on getting better. You see, in photography it’s pretty hard to judge how well your progression is coming on. The easy thing to do is compare your images to ones shared by your favorite photographers and get down beat about it. While it’s important to remember their skill level is something to aim for, what we don’t see is their trash can.</p><p>For every stunning image shared there are hundreds, if not thousands, of images in the bin. All we see is the polished end result curated to share online, and that goes for almost everything in life. For every runner that jogs past your flat out sprint. Or every writer pushing out amazingly written concise posts. We don’t see the whole story. No one is present for the painful miles of hard work, the deleted drafts and indeed everything else that goes on behind the scenes.</p><p>This could be said for all social media too, comparing <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/insides-vs-outsides/">your insides to others outsides</a> can be completely demotivating when you are trying to learn a skill or just get better at something. What is worse is that we all know it with ourselves, we pick the best of everything to showcase, but forget when consuming others work. However keeping in mind other peoples trash can is exactly the same as yours can be vitally important.</p><p>I am a big proponent of marginal gains, and improving steadily and consistently over time in whatever it is we choose to do. Spending time to make sure we are working towards a goal at all times and only using others to motivate us in the correct way. No matter how good the end product may be, we all have a trash can full of rubbish that never sees the light of day.</p>

     <p>It was a very quick thought that flowed through one day when writing out <a href="https://email.gr36.com/archive/greg-thinks-things-33/">edition 33 of my newsletter</a>. A fleeting emotion that struck me when I was thinking about what had happened that week. A week where I had mourned not having a camera around, and not been able to do what I enjoyed. It was strange how not having <em>one thing</em> in my possession pulled on my strings that I ever anticipated, and felt somewhat embarrassing to admit to publicly.</p><p>In April this year<a href="/2021/04/19/i-feel-like.html"> I chose to sell my A7iii camera</a> due to lack of use, and wanting to slim down my possessions to a level that I was happy with. I am a minimalist, but sometimes I forget and tend to have to go through a purge every now and again to calm things down. I felt a huge pang when delivering it to its new owner, but due to <a href="/2021/03/26/saying-goodbye-to.html">seeing no end in sight</a> of the pandemic knew I couldn’t leave it gathering dust much longer. Since then I didn’t think much of it, until two weeks ago.</p><p>Our progression out of periodic lockdowns has progressed dramatically over the last couple of months. Now things <em>are</em> opening back up, I have more opportunity to get out and about. Had I known things would go this fast I perhaps would not have chosen to sell so soon, but I digress. This thought of not having a camera, made me feel quite sad. It is silly to get emotional over a possession, but this one in particular signified an important part of my personality and for that I mourned more than a little.</p><p>For fear of repeating myself, there is just something about holding and using a camera that means a lot to me. As good as lenses and sensors get in smartphones (and I have used loads of them) they just can’t compete in my eyes. Are there loads of people more talented than me? Sure, but in my head I am a photographer (my editing sucks a bit though) but not having a camera made me not feel like one anymore. Even more so saying it out load.</p><p>I am glad to say that my wife got fed up of me talking about it, thinking about it, and of course procrastinating, and bought me an A7c (my reasoning for not buying another A7iii is too long to go into) and I can’t wait to get it. I’m planning on shooting more street things and documenting my increased traveling so this compact FF shooter should be perfect. I also feel like I have a bit of myself back — I am never doing this again.</p><p>Want to contribute <a href="https://www.wexphotovideo.com/sigma-100-400mm-f5-6-3-contemporary-dg-dn-os-lens-sony-e-fit-1743467">towards a new lens</a> 😆</p>

     <p>Recently myself and my wife were talking about death. Nothing happened, it’s just the weird way our minds work and we often end up walking down strange conversational paths, and this one was no different. We both have very different view points on passing on, and although I have no ability to affect the way others feel or what they do after I go, I know one thing for sure — no sadness.</p><p>My words were along the lines of “if any of you lot wear black to my funeral I will haunt you”. Which is my tongue in cheek way of making my point that although I am sure you are sad I am gone, please celebrate the time I was here. I’m not egotistical enough to claim everyone should feel blessed I was in their lives, but please be happy of the legacy I leave behind. Even if it is dad jokes and bad blog posts. Be happy you had something and not sad it’s gone.</p><p>Then it suddenly hit me. This is exactly the opposite of what I have been doing about working from home. I have been moping around and morning <a href="/2021/06/20/work-and-home.html">the loss of WFH</a> instead of being happy that I had the opportunity to experience it for more than a year. I had no right to work from home, but had an excellent experience that I was lucky to have. An experience, during a pandemic, that many did not have and their lives have changed for the worse because of it.</p><p>Like a marriage break up or a loss, I am happy that I managed to have this experience. I really enjoyed it, I am more than open to returning to something like it in the future and in actual fact I will strive to achieve it. However I realise that I am not entitled to work from home, there are many benefits to being in a more social environment. Although I do need lots of <a href="/2018/11/13/im-an-outgoing.html">down time to recharge my batteries</a>, I like being able to work collectively in person as it suits me well.</p>

<p>It’s no wonder people are working longer, earlier, later, on weekends, and whenever they have a spare moment. People can’t get work done at work anymore. Work claws away at life. Life has become work’s leftovers. The doggy bag. The remnants. The scraps.</p>
<p>I am constantly surprised by the level of work some people seem to put in. This seems a very American thing, and perhaps they are mostly chasing the American dream, but the level of life that their work takes up is frankly ridiculous. Spending 12 hour days at work and then being expected to work weekends and also slave away with no paid holiday (vacation for America readers) seems so weird.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with hustling when it’s needed but it doesn’t have to be the standard to succeed surely. Work to live, don’t live to work is the age old saying but as technology takes on more and more of the slack, why exactly are people working more and more?</p>

<p>One of my most enjoyable newsletters is <a href="https://tablethabit.com/">Tablet Habit</a> by Jeff Perry, particularly because I am <a href="/2021/06/23/force-some-ipad.html">diving back into the world again</a> and using my iPad for everything. I have been lucky enough to be linked by him a few times and it always makes me feel very humble.</p>
<p>I never feel <a href="/2020/01/22/i-dont-feel.html">interesting enough to be linked to</a> and frankly never expect my things to be read, but after years of doing it you would think that my thoughts would have changed towards myself. Don’t get me wrong I have had periods in my life where my ego has gotten away with more than it should, but I think its important to always remain at least a little bit grounded.</p>
<p>However my feelings are different. I am amazed when people say they read my things and it still feels weird even after a decade.</p>

<p>This week, Jeff Bezos went to space. I am not interested enough to get emotional about it, although <a href="https://500ish.com/hold-out-those-great-hopes-b43816657a7c">some people are</a>. I am also not going to use this to launch into an anti-Amazon tirade, because I could. I have simply been thinking that I long for a time when people with loads of money gave it back.</p>
<p>In my youth, multi-millionaires spent their wealth building public buildings, donating to schools and putting their name on things that helped. All they seemed to want was to massage their ego with a library named after them, not disappear into the sky inside a phallic shaped rocket. People of the UK became used to Richard Branson trying to go <a href="https://www.wickersworld.co.uk/the-ballooning-exploits-of-richard-branson/">around the world every now and again</a>, but the rest of them were benefactors to things that made our community better.</p>
<p>I am sure Bezos et al do give money away but it makes you really think when they pull stunts like this. Its become a meme that they could fix world hunger but instead choose to do x, but maybe its time they become accountable for something. Instead of launching something into orbit, or trying to get to Mars, they take a look around and choose something to fix because there are plenty of things on this planet that need attention.</p>

     <p>One of my favorite things to do is read through all the items I have saved throughout the day to my articles. It gives me time to wind down and usually gives me something to think about, and where most of my <a href="https://gr36.com/categories/link-posts/">link posts</a> come from. Unfortunately I can’t find anything that reliably shares any highlight I make to Obsidian, although things are <a href="https://github.com/nybbles/obsidian-pocket">in the making</a>, so I made a Shortcut.</p><p>Pocket have changed the way that articles are shared out of the app recently and make this much more accessible instead of hiding the URL. This Shortcut isn’t the most aesthetically pleasing I am sure it could be done better, but it works!

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/heyyoudvd/">heyyoudvd</a> replying to a thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/om130b/why_do_apples_media_services_apps_suck_so_bad/">Why do Apple’s media services apps suck so bad?</a>:</p>
<p>This was the single biggest fear I had with Apple getting into the content business, and it’s coming to fruition. When you become a services company, you are financially incentivized to sell your services. You’re incentivized to put your content ahead of your end user experience.</p>
<p>That’s why the Music and TV apps feel like giant ads. Instead of providing you with tools to organize, arrange, and sift through your content, these apps are built like giant billboards, advertising the next movie and the next album that they want you to consume. It’s not about what you want to watch or listen to; it’s about what content <em>they want to push on you</em>.</p>
<p>The surprising thing from this thread is the fact that so many people don’t realise this. It’s the reason that most things from Apple are average at best and no where near the level of innovation they were in the past. When you reach a certain level of revenue and have overwhelming responsibilities to share holders, your outlook becomes much wider than it once was.</p>
<p>As Seth Goodin <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/seth-godin-new-business-5-step-fdb354988c23">would say</a> you have to start making “average products for average people”. You are no longer interested in creating great products for your fans, but need to look at larger and larger audiences and as such become vanilla.</p>
<p>Apple no longer makes iPhones, Macs, iPad, apps and everything else for <em>you</em>. It makes them for everyone.</p>
<p>The service example used here is a perfect one, there is no incentive to make the best app on the market any longer. If you’re Apple there <em>is</em> a huge incentive to make one that pushes its wears in your face. Apple no longer even conforms to its own rules for apps, and only upholds its App Store rules for some companies and not others. All in the pursuit of income and you, as users, should not be surprised.</p>
<p>Users hold up revenue figures and ridiculous numbers of iPhones sold as a badge of honor and then are surprised when it comes back to bite them in the ass. You don’t get it both ways I’m afraid.</p>

<p>Chris Hannah on the <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://chrishannah.me/weeds-are-subjective/">subjectivity of weeds</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, when reading a product review, whether it’s an app or a computer, it’s important to remember that a weed to them might not necessarily be a weed to you. So you need to take into consideration any biases that the reviewer might hold themselves, before applying their findings to your situation.</p></blockquote>
<p>This comes up a lot when talking about iPads as Chris points out but also absolutely anything that you can form an opinion on. One of the most important skills is to figure out where the other person is coming from, any biases that have an affect of their opinions. As well as other deciding factors.</p>
<p>I often find when looking at reviews the cons pointed out don’t really matter to me, or seem harsh and more often than not some of the features that they enjoy don’t work in a way that I need. A weed is only a weed of you don’t want it there.</p>

<p>I feel like I am cutting more things out of my life than I am putting in at the minute, but its a journey that is proving ever beneficial. Amazon have annoyed me to such a stage that I am removing my reliance on them completely, a task that unfortunately is proving more difficult that I first anticipated. So much so that I have almost given up a couple of times but I am slowly managing to find other options.</p>
<p>Purchases are pretty easy to remove, I just find everything somewhere else. The only downside is delivery and expectations. I have been a Prime subscriber for years now and as such order everything from Amazon. They stock almost everything, at a great price, with free delivery and a slick distribution and returns network — there is no equal and perhaps that is part of the problem.</p>
<p>Prime is now canceled, I never watched the TV anyway, but other stores that sell items have no where near the level of service that Amazon do. So expectations need to be dampened a little, and hopefully that may mean I might buy less stuff! I have found a local place to collect my dog food from at regular intervals, and this weekend found a place that offers the last few bits we had on a subscription with Amazon. I am supporting more local businesses now than ever and hate myself for relying on Amazon for so long instead of doing a bit of work and finding other places.</p>
<p>Due to their incompetence Amazon have lost around £200 from me already this month as I have purchased all business needed from somewhere else, and will continue to loose around £45 per month not including one off purchases from now on. Don’t get me wrong the company doesn’t give a damn about me dumping them, they told me as much themselves, but if more people do then it may cause a dent.</p>
<p>I just need to purchase a different E-Reader and Kindle will be the last one to go. I purchased a physical book for the first time in years yesterday! Fun times.</p>

     <p>I wrote about deactivating my account on this <a href="https://email.gr36.com/archive/gtt-31/">weeks newsletter</a> sent out on Thursday. It is something I need to do, if only to prove to myself I can. Without going in to too much detail I just want to break the habit of scrolling through it all the time — read the newsletter for more words on it. Anyway I digress.</p><p>I decided to log in today, not because I opened it in habit, but because I needed to contact someone and had forgotten their number. I discovered that all of my followers have gone, and all of the people i was following have also been removed — which was a surprise but gave me a perfect moment of clarity.</p><p>There seems little point carrying on with Twitter now. I can’t really be bothered to put in any work following people again and curating my account. My first thought was that this may give me the ‘fresh start’ I wanted, but once I checked in on a few people I quickly realised I would simply end up following the same people as before and nothing much has changed.</p><p>The same topics are going around, the same poor quality trending topics are still trending, and generally I felt absolutely nothing. I wondered if this was doing the right thing logging back in again, but turns out it has actually put me off even more. I havn’t missed out on anything, the real people that I have found have reached out or not bothered. The news that I once loved to follow flows almost straight on to blogs etc so the RSS feeds I follow surface everything I need.</p><p>I feel a little bit as if I am standing in the corner of a party refusing to talk to people like some unsociable idiot but checking in actually helped me frame things in my mind better. Where as I always thought I would go back and join in in some way, now I do not see myself returning. I changed my imagery and deleted all of my tweets to really signify this intention.</p><p>I want my page to be there for a while. With the sight realisation I may be speaking to soon, I don’t see my self going back. If I decide to one day then it will be because I really want to start again and at the moment there is no value in that.</p>

<p>This was very much me when I first tried out iOS15 a few weeks back. The iOS version especially just breaks my brain and every bit of muscle memory built from years of using an iPhone.</p>
<p>I still don’t get it though. Even after taking a step back and looking at the way it works. The bottom URL bar I can forgive even though it feels like changing for changing sake, but the buttons that users need are all now hidden away. Reload, share, in fact everything other than forwards and backwards is behind a nondescript three dots. This feels a little like the multi-function reply button from iOS13 so hopefully the designers will realise how stupid this is — Matt Birchler has offered up a few ideas that are straight from current HIG designs.</p>

<p>This week I chose to deactivate my Twitter account at least temporarily. There was no single reason for doing this, because if there was I am sure it would of happened long before now. It is simply because I don’t like the way using Twitter makes me feel. I have <a href="/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html">written before</a> about my love of the service, but the amount of time and attention it takes away from me. I just want to experience boredom again.</p>
<p>Every waking moment when I have a spare moment I would find myself just opening up Twitter. I say myself because this happens without conscious thought. I don’t decide to check it, my habit just kicks in and I am scrolling through the latest things being canceled or people moaning about whatever today’s thing is before I am even aware of it.</p>
<blockquote><p>I know I’m an addict because Twitter hacked itself so deep into my circuitry that it interrupted the very formation of my thoughts. …a corporation that operates against my best interests has me thinking in 280 characters. Every thought, every experience, seems to be reducible to this haiku, and my mind is instantly engaged by the challenge of concision – <a href="https://apple.news/AiWNoyb6vRgGoWgbFmj2uTQ">Caitlin Flanagan for The Atlantic</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>You see, I have learnt to avoid the rabbit holes as much as possible, but being mindful of the habit and the time wasting has been enough to wake me up to the fact it is simply not good for me. The <em>real</em> issue is that I miss some of the people that I interact with on Twitter and no where else. I have some very close friends that I wonder if they will just fall away, however what keeps me going is the fact that true friendships find a way to continue.</p>
<p>I don’t see myself falling away completely, I would like my account to still exist just in case I want to go back one day, or to check every now and again. However at the moment I don’t trust myself, I must break this addiction. This is the only way.</p>

<p>I think I have shared this post before, because it is full of relatable content and take away quotes – but this one hits perfectly.</p>
<p>When i first started with twitter seeing all the “just heading to yoga” tweets because almost everyone I followed I knew personally and the service as a whole was pretty quiet. Knowing things about the people you wanted was enjoyable and easy to get through the noise.</p>
<p>We now live in a time where everything is regurgitated onto your time line, there is no way to filter specific types of tweets, and the platform as a whole is full of noise. As such I have to move further and further away from the platform I love.</p>
<p>Not least becuase the service is determined to surface the most polarising and “engaging” tweets into my timeline and its all a bit too much.</p>

</a>

    <time datetime="2021-07-03 14:42:00 &#43;0000">03 Jul 2021</time>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>My blog is currently hosted on the excellent micro.blog service. I could go on about why I chose this place to host, but my thoughts are summed up on <a href="/2021/03/28/why-microblog.html">my post here</a>. It suits me perfectly because I publish everything to one place, from short ‘tweets’ to photos and also all of my writing. Due to this ease of posting I do most of it mobile from iOS with the help of some Shortcuts.</p>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>Pictures are pretty easy to handle on micro.blog. If you want to post one image with some accompanying text there are a <a href="https://micro.blog/about">range of apps</a> to use, including the very Instragram-esc <a href="https://sunlit.io">Sunlit</a>. Meaning you can post whatever you want wherever you want.</p>
<p>If you are writing a longer post and want to put some accompanying images in it, this simple Shortcut has you covered. It will upload the image to your micro.blog uploads section and then copy the link to the image directly to your clipboard ready to paste into your writing.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/1c9552c63a.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="152" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/01d2ded5a96f4dc28bbb9961642fc08b">Get It Here</a></p>
<p>All you will need to do is attain a app token by going to Account settings and scrolling to the bottom and clicking App Tokens or clicking <a href="https://micro.blog/account/apps">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Text</h2>
<p>No good posting something without any text. For Shorter ‘tweets’ a range of apps are available to making posting easier, however if you really want to speed things up this simple Shortcut for iOS will ask for your post and then…post it.</p>
<p>For longer posts with a title this simple shortcut will help you out. Simply highlight the text you want to post and share it it the Shortcut, it presumes you are writing in markdown and will remove Title formatting for you and use this as the post Title.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/735cb9231a.jpg" alt="" width="1230" height="566" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/772cc414fc5d453594d87706f3bbc465">Get It Here</a></p>
<p>All you will need to do is attain a app token by going to Account settings and scrolling to the bottom and clicking App Tokens or clicking <a href="https://micro.blog/account/apps">here</a>. This posting really is one touch. There is no facility to add in categories (I may work on this later) but I use filters very heavily so these are well worth <a href="https://www.manton.org/2019/11/06/microblog-filters-with.html">looking into</a>.</p>
<p>Note: These currently do not work on iOS15!</p>

     <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>If I can be allowed to stick my neck out a little here, I think the iPad is the perfect blogging device. The battery life is great, it’s very affordable, you can take it anywhere and interact with it in several different ways. In a pinch you can even take photos with it, although you might get some strange looks. Publishing from iOS has also never been easier, and here’s how to do it with a couple of Shortcuts.</p>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>Often choosing images is the hardest part of a blog post, once you’ve chosen them you have to upload them and choose where you want the go. Which can be a real pain particularly on a mobile device. WordPress is pretty easy to work with but means you have to stop what you’re doing and use either the web or their app to sort out images. This is usually where people give up, but fear not, the Shortcut below will upload your image and copy the markdown syntax for it directly to your clipboard.</p>
<p>This Shortcut was created by <a href="https://initialcharge.net/projects/toolkit/">Mike Rockwell at Initial Charge.</a> who has a whole toolkit of Shortcuts for publishers.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/211e433487.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="307" /></p>
<p>Get it <a href="https://github.com/gr36/Shortcuts/blob/276ec6a1d0773fabb11f8f8bdd85ab5b634db1ef/Upload%20Image.wflow">here</a></p>
<p>No more messing around, simply select your image, use the shortcut and paste in where you want the image to appear in your writing. You’ll need to set up a <a href="https://tinypng.com/developers">Tiny PNG account</a> with this one so you don;t take up too much space with your images and pages load faster, but its really easy to do. In fact because this Shortcut is so simple I sometimes now upload the images I want to use and paste them in first.</p>
<h2>Publishing To WordPress</h2>
<p>Once all the words are finished, the final step is to publish your posts. This usually involves copying the text, opening the web browser, logging in and going through the various steps of actually getting everything out there. This can be streamlined down to a few taps using the Shortcut below. It is one I have <a href="/2021/01/28/shortcut-publishing-to.html">shared this one before</a>, which was first created by Tim Nahumck in his <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-4-siri-shortcuts-wordpress-and-more/">drafts review</a> I simply updated it to use newer Shortcuts methods.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/ce3789c3fe.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="307" /></p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The future is finally here. No you still can’t work on an iPad, but game streaming is finally good and starting to remove the need for hardware. You should already know going into this that I am already well on the boat with cloud services like this, and a heavy <a href="/2021/02/13/stadia.html">Stadia user</a>. It was the service that got me <a href="/2021/03/04/playing-again.html">playing games again</a>, and although I feel no affiliation to the service, I like it very much.</p>
<p>This morning for some strange reason I noticed that I can sign up for Gamepass ultimate now for a £1! Whilst still in beta, the service allows for anyone to sign up following a pretty lengthy closed beta period. I don’t own any gaming hardware at all, so cloud services are all I am really interested in currently. Despite my love of Stadia I have alway had half an eye on Gamepass Ultimate. It contains a few games that I would want to play, and seems like it <em>should</em> put Googles dalliance with cloud gaming into the shade.</p>
<p>The two services have lots of crossover parts, whilst adopting two pretty different approaches to gaming. Stadia wants to be your everything, provide you with free games for a small fee and allow you to buy others from them. Whilst Microsoft simply wants you to pay a subscription and be allowed to play games from studios it owns or works very closely with. There is no facility to buy games outside of these provided with your subscription.</p>
<p>With Stadia, games do rotate in and out of ‘pro’ (which costs £8.99) but once you have claimed the games you can continue to play them — as long as you keep paying the subscription of course. With Gamepass you’ll never own anything, presumably games will stay on the service and more will be added, but if you stop paying, no more gaming. Where as Google will allow you to keep playing any games you have purchased without paying a penny, all be it at 1080p and not 4K like with the pro service.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/fa1d87b3c6.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" /></p>
<p>With all this said, Gamepass is actually amazing value for money, and even more so if you own an Xbox or a gaming PC. Included is Xbox Live Gold and EA Play in the £10.99 a month subscription. If you have hardware you will also get more games — for example you can play FIFA 21 on Xbox or PC, but not cloud streaming for some strange reason. However the quality of game available for free is much larger on Gamepass.</p>
<p>Ultimatly it all boils down to Microsofts ability to do what Google wanted to do. It has the power to make games available because it has been doing this longer, and owns its own studios. Google have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286252/google-stadia-studios-shut-down-timing-good-progress-report">shuttered all of its first party studios</a> despite spending millions on them, and instead are to focus on partnering with others the develop or port over games, with varying success.</p>
<p>Although Gamepass is the much better value for money, I am reluctant to jump in without being able to buy other games. this may lead to me having both services until that happens, or as MS no doubt will hope, I buy an Xbox. I see Gamepass as a huge edition if you have an Xbox or a gaming PC, and will only get stronger over time. However for someone like me I could run out of games I actually want to play fast and then have no where to go. </p>
<p>I expect Gamepass to very quickly outshine Stadia and hopefully push it to get much better. Or kill it off completely.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When publishing a link post yesterday about blogging feeling more away from regular social media, the main point picked up on was comments on my posts. As <a href="https://twitter.com/curtismchale/status/1409638107331194881?s=20">Curtis Hale points out</a> there is no provision for people to leave comments on my posts, other than replies on micro.blog.</p>
<p>I <a href="/2021/03/28/why-microblog.html">chose micro.blog recently</a> due to its social side and also the nature of the platform allowing me to post everything in one place. I didn’t spend any time wondering <a href="/2021/02/13/165913.html">where does this go</a>, and put short ‘tweets’, Instagram style photos and long blog posts all on one blog. Making the experience a bit more personal.</p>
<p>In exchange for this I get a much more rigid platform than the WordPress one I came from, and rely totally on one persons vision for what he wants. Manson does an excellent job of running micro.blog but that’s not really the point, that is to say that I have given over a large portion of control to another person. Much like Facebook and Twitter dictate what I can and can’t post, micro.blog controls the way the platform works and how it moves forwards.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/691af88fb3.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" /></p>
<p>When thinking about comments the only thing that works are micro.blog replies. I should <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/05/19/webmention-and-twitter.html">be able to pull in replies from Twitter</a> using bridg.y now, but it has never worked. I no doubt <em>could</em> look at other options and try and run a stand alone commenting system, but this would be hacked on rather than an integrated solution. Giving over this large level of control sometimes feels freeing at times, but in equal measures frustrating.</p>
<p>If the platform decides to go a direction that you don’t want to then you are at its mercy, or you pack up and leave. Something that <a href="/2020/03/03/being-able-to.html">should be easy to do</a>, but often at times isn’t. Perhaps something more open is better suited to what I want to achieve, or where I want my blog to go.</p>
<p>I am lucky in the fact that I can usually mold things to get to where I want to be and if I think about comments and the potential of avoiding the trappings of social media, my current platform does not provide it. I guess its important to think about these things when you give over control, and rember that needs can change a lot faster than platforms do.</p>

  Sure, it doesn’t have to be here which technically, I suppose, is a breach of my (self-imposed) embargo on social media but a blog (don’t ask me why) feels different. It sounds a bit woo-woo but it feels like I’m conversing with the Universe. No, not necessarily that one, but the one that circles the compass of my life.

<p>I love Julians writing, it’s always filled with thought provoking ideas and often leads me asking questions about myself and the universe. His love of writing always shines through and he happens to be on a similar logged off embargo <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/06/28/logging-off.html">to myself</a>.</p>
<p>Writing and blogging doesn’t feel like social media. It doesn’t feel like being ‘online’ but it can come with the <a href="/2021/03/13/blogging-isnt-social.html">same trappings</a> if you get bogged down in sharing it everywhere. You have no idea what people are saying about you because no one seems to leave comments or write replies any more, if there was more interaction on the web without having to get super nerdy on the indie web then maybe we could all quit Twitter.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The past weekend we managed to grab some time away as a family. It’s been a long time coming as we booked this in March 2020, so the release to finally get away was huge. The break away wasn’t anything lavish, but even a couple of days with zero to worry about and we can enjoy some activities together was fantastic. For the long weekend I chose to not take any connective technology with me, and it can’t tell you how both weird and wonderful it felt.</p>
<p>The day we arrived whilst waiting to order some food, twice in fairly quick succession I raised my wrist to see what the time was. Only to see a faint tan line and in indent from my Apple Watch. I let out a small groan due to lacking the ability to check the time, and wondered why on earth all of my tech was at home a couple of hours drive away. I didn’t need it, I didn’t want it, yet my brain still tried to play through the tried and tested route of fixing a small period of boredom with a gadget.</p>
<p>As much as I am aware that <a href="/2020/09/09/its-not-the.html">it is not the internet that does these things to me</a>, it is becoming harder and harder to mediate them with the reliance I have of both working online and enjoying spending time connected. I am currently managing to live in an in between space where I try and limit the time I spend with gadgets, but not miss out on what they can do for me.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b8ffc36d39.jpg" width="600" height="406" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Pandemic Issues</h2>
<p>There were a few issues. When we left each other for even a small period of time, such as walking to the shop to fetch some breakfast, my wife couldn’t update me on what she needed. Of course this wasn’t a huge deal, but I also couldn’t use the NHS COVID app to track me being at several facilities, and as such felt a bit out of place. I could have done this manually, but I am not comfortable leaving my personal details on a random forms, so opted to just rely on my wife scanning the QR code.</p>
<p>All of the attractions we visited also required ordering of food and drink from a smartphone app which again I had to lean on my wife more than usual. The pandemic has placed a reliance on our connected lives and the smartness of our devices far outside the ability to contact with others. I am under <a href="/2020/08/09/i-cant-go.html">no illusions that me being without a smartphone</a> for a longer length of time just wouldn’t work out, but it’s nice to dream a little.</p>
<p>The lack of Apple Pay, messaging and everything else my phone does for me didn’t crop up  as much as I thought it would. Most obstacles could be overcome with a little thought, but having a computer in your packet is just so much easier. However the silence from my need to check social media and the reduced pocket space needed made for a much more enjoyable break away. What first was an annoyance of not being able to find out the time became something I enjoyed and instead focused on other things.</p>
<p>I have not decided when I will return yet as I am enjoying a break away for the next week. I did open Twitter today to be greeted with 13 notifications. All of which are spam to try and get me engaged in the platform again. So I swiftly closed it again. I miss it, but not in the ways I expected. It’s great to log off for a bit every now and again.</p>
<p>I might realise how much I miss it…. Perhaps.</p>

    <h1 class="p-name">Using Craft For Daily Notes</h1>
</a>
 
<div class="datetime" style="font-size: 70%">
    <i class="fa-regular fa-calendar"></i> 
    <time datetime="2021-06-24 17:14:00 &#43;0000">24 Jun 2021</time>
  </div>
  </div>
<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>One of the most beneficial habits I have gotten into is taking daily notes, and I really wish I had started it earlier in life. My initial foray into Roam Research gave me the inspiration to start recording my day, simply because it is right in your face whenever you open the page. This practice has gone with me to my new home on <a href="http://www.gr36.com/2021/05/15/my-obsidian-set.html">Obsidian</a>, then a few weeks ago <a href="https://www.craft.do">Craft</a> launched something so <a href="/2021/06/03/i-love-the.html">of course I checked it out</a>.</p>
<p>Craft is a strange app that I cant really work out. When it first launched it was pitched in a strange place that didn’t quite do 100% of anything I needed. It wasn’t quite a writing app that did everything a paid app should, but had a weird wiki kind of vibe to it. I can only describe it as if Notion and <a href="/2017/01/19/bear-the-serious.html">Bear Notes</a> had a baby.</p>
<p>Having tried, and not liked very much, Craft a couple of times already, it was only the update to include daily notes that peeked my interest. While I am no stranger to jumping around apps, I wasn’t quite ready to start messing around with my set up again. However there is no harm in trying things out without getting invested and this update is a huge one.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cb564a1b6e.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>By introducing a redesigned sidebar, Craft have allowed you to separate these notes away from everything else you want to write. <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-obsidian-set/">Daily notes</a> is a practice that I preach to almost anyone that will listen, the one thing that remains from <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-to-start/">my time using Roam Research</a>. In these I record almost everything that happens during my working day, such as telephone calls, things I am thinking, interactions I have had and anything else I think I might need to refer back to later. This allows me to just get things out of my brain at the time they pop up so I can act on them later, or refer back to them if needed.</p>
<p>One thing that Craft now does really well is the ability to take meeting notes. After you have granted the app permission it will display any calendar events and allow you to start a meeting note with one click. Information from the calendar event is populated into this, and the note then shows up in the daily note and also the in app calendar. I like to distribute the notes I have made later to those that have attended, or invited so being able to do this in PDF, docx or whatever method you need is really handy. If you adopt Craft for work, you can also share these with the users you need to and even mention them in the doc itself.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5fbb18b607.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="craft-back-links">Craft Back Links</h2>
<p>Craft works with the now very popular method of back-linking meaning you can link notes together if needed and refer to them at later points. This is the real benefit of me being able to refer back to things I have recorded later on. This could be some bits of information that led to a meeting, or something as simple as an idea that I later turn into a blog post. In the screen shot above, I make a note at the end of the meeting to reference a new one set up (we usually agree on this and arrange the event in the meeting) so this then shows up when I start in the new meeting note. I can then open the note in split screen or a new tab and refer back really easily.</p>
<p>Backlinks are also really handy when building out some knowledge and making notes around topics. Amazingly handy if you are studying something, but also useful for daily life. I get ideas quite often that pop up during my morning pages that i write out when first at my desk. I can then start to link recurring topics together really easily by using <code>[[]]</code>and searching for the old note. This isn’t <em>as</em> useful as the implementation in Roam or Obsidian, but its not far away and is a little more approachable.</p>
<p>One update I would really love to see is the inclusion of unlinked references, and also improvements to the ability to search for individual block references inline. I don’t like taking my hands away from the keyboard when typing things out on morning pages, so this would be much better. However I realise that this isn’t Obsidian to I am happy to take some compromises.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/da87d3f630.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
<p>More often referred to as tasks, Craft has inbuilt checklists for you to be able to add in meeting actions in markdown or using its <code>/</code> command. Although Craft is no replacement for a task manager, you can use this as a sudo one for recording things to do. Each day will highlight any outstanding tasks next to the date. You can of course put these actions into your task manager of choice, Craft works really well with Things 3 providing a link back to the note in the tasks set up.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ea50cfc764.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>With all that said, if you intend to use the tasks inside Craft please note that there is no easy way to see all set up items in one place. The only place these are highlighted is in the daily notes. I have reached out to the developers and they <a href="https://twitter.com/craftdocsapp/status/1403255301067919360?s=20">are intending to implement this soon</a>.</p>
<p>There you have it, a very brief dalliance with daily notes in Craft. It isn’t as fleshed out as I would like but it’s pretty robust if you are going in with no expectations. I am sticking to Obsidian for the time being, but will have half an eye on any updates coming out.</p>

     <p>When I think about all of the hardware I have owned over the last few years there are far too many in that list that I care to admit. I do switch around phones every so often for reviews, but my personal computer life takes on huge dramatic swifts every now and again. Since <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/today-is-the/">prosumously ditching</a> the iPad after more than 5 years as my computer I have gone <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/using-an-ipad/">backwards</a> and forwards switching out laptops, for iPads, and back again. I think it’s time to stop.</p><p>In fact I think it was time to stop a while ago. I am really starting to struggle with work and life separation due to only having one Mac now. So much so I don’t want to open my laptop at home. I know that I will dive in to things that I, granted need to do, but don’t need to do when I wanted to write a journal log.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/f74adb8b16.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>I have some inspiration to thank for my meandering thoughts. Jack Batty <a href="https://copingmechanism.com/2021/trying-to-live-on-the-ipad-for-a-while/">wrote about</a> wanting to try and make the iPad his everything, and this part particularly stuck out.</p><blockquote>But, iOS is calmer than macOS, and right now I need a little calm. – <a href="https://copingmechanism.com/2021/trying-to-live-on-the-ipad-for-a-while/">Jack Baty</a></blockquote><p>To use the word that tech commentators hate to hear — when I am ‘working’ on an iPad (e.g. writing a blog post or editing a photo), it <em>feels</em> different. As Jack puts it, using iPad OS is calmer, it never feels like work. Granted sometimes it’s a full time job trying to work out how you do somethings that are simple on a Mac but <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-simplicity-of/">the simplicity</a> is so refreshing. The iPad feels <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/this-feels-more/">computer<em>ish</em></a> without feeling like the rest of my waking life.</p><p>So, here’s the ‘forcing’ part. I am going all in again. Apart from my work day, which I can do nothing about, I am using an iPad for everything else. I haven’t spent anything, it’s a 2018 12.9″ iPad Pro with a Magic Keyboard I have had for a long time so I have nothing much to lose. I am actually quite excited.</p>

Many people dismiss this as a “marketing line” and although there are some worrying trends in the way they are going about things, this is the Apple way I approve of. One of the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/09/newsletter-publishers-concerned-apples-mail-privacy-protection-will-crater-industry">biggest push backs</a> has been against their improvements to Apple Mail that removes tracking and spying tactics used by marketers.</p>

<p>Presumably Apple will route emails through a proxy and load tracking pixels on their servers before serving the email to you and I am really struggling to find a downside to this. There will be loads of people waiting to tell me how wrong I am, just as they did <a href="/2021/03/10/stop-tracking-random.html">last time I pointed at them</a>. I am happy to be proven otherwise, but most of they people that speak up are ingrained in a business that needs this data, but my conclusion is drawn from three areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your newsletter is free, you don’t (or you shouldn’t) care if people read it or not, because the work involved in producing it is exactly the same. </li>
<li>If your newsletter is paid, you are paid by the people that sign up to receive it. Thus it makes no difference if people actually read it or not. The cost of production is the same, and you get paid the same regardless. </li>
<li>If you send marking emails, you will need to see if your emails are successful or not. This is the only area where tracking would matter to you, and to this is say tough. Full disclosure I am involved in this area of business and I am <em>still</em> happy Apple are turning off the tap to those more predatory than myself.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/774f0c2865.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" /></p>
<p>You see, there is nothing inherently wrong with tracking if an email is opened or not, it can be useful to know. We have it in message services such as iMessage, and you have been able to do this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-and-request-read-receipts-and-delivery-notifications-a34bf70a-4c2c-4461-b2a1-12e4a7a92141">optionally in Exchange</a> email for years. However these are transparent and something the end user has to agree to. Presumably using the method detailed above, all tracking pixels would be marked as opened anyway, and then it is up to the user to read it or not. However most tracking doesn’t stop at this.</p>
<p>Take a look at most marketers email dashboard and you will be able to see not just when it was opened and what links are clicked on but also how many times and where the person is! Data that should be protected unless a user opts in to share this with you. <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/use-track-mailchimp/">Pixel tracking</a> is one of the many scourges of the internet and I trust Apple to lead the fight against it.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.litmus.com/blog/apple-mail-privacy-protection-for-marketers/">cant say for sure</a> if the open rate metric will no longer be valid, but with certainty everything else will be killed off and I for one am overjoyed!</p>

<p>There is a lot of differing opinions when people change their decisions. The weirdest for me is when some think that changing your position makes you weak, or that you can’t be trusted. When in fact it shows a much larger ability to be balanced in your thoughts.</p>
<p>The common derogative term is “flip-flopping” and while never being set on your position is a bad thing, or as my Granddad would say “always being on whatever boat is floating” — when the situation changes there is absolutely nothing wrong with changing the way you approach it.</p>
<p>In fact it is the correct thing to do.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>We’ve has a huge shift at work, returning to more of an office based environment for at least a little while. I am really excited to be building up a larger team around me to push the company forward, but my trusty iMac Pro has been donated to a returning member of staff more in need.</p>
<p>Due to <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1405492177254371329?s=20">my indecision</a> in knowing what to do I am not left with only one computer. I know ultimate first world problem right! My working machine is my personal laptop, one that is with me almost always. I do love my 13″ MacBook Pro though, I purchased it a few months before they switched to M1 and it looks awesome working on a <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1403245747684921346?s=20">nice big display</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway I digress slightly. The point I am trying to make is that due to this shift, my computer is now everything. Personal things and working things are all done on the same laptop. So where I could separate my life slightly from my laptop to my iMac, that’s no longer possible. I never set up emails on my personal machines before and installed very few working apps. That is no longer possible, my home and office have merged, everywhere I turn working is always in my face.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/024bb57546.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" /></p>
<p>For most of the time this is fine. I love the work I do, and I often have ideas for design bits or some inspiration at the weekends. Being able to jump straight into Illustrator or Figma is a blessing for those sorts of situations. For every other time when I just want to open up my laptop and do some personal tasks, my emails and other work things are just right there staring at me!</p>
<p>If I thought I had lots of <a href="/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html">Twitter muscle memory</a>, I have even more for work tasks. I just find myself replying to emails on a Sunday afternoon, or managing tasks for the upcoming week without even realising it. Much like my working office being the same as where I do my personal things, it gets to the stage where there is no separation and I never feel like I am away. Some personal rules or spaces need setting up I think. Perhaps two users for my laptop. Or maybe I just need to <a href="/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html">get an iPad</a>!</p>

<p>I might start a movement about slowing down and thinking instead of reacting to the barrage of stimulus we get on a daily basis. I’ve done it, as will have most of you, when I should have opened I dialogue and tried to talk.</p>
<p>I’ve also been blocked by people that I follow very closely and took it amazingly personal, when they could have had a number of reasons to ban me from their timeline!</p>
<p>I am a huge proponent of talking to people that think different to you, and in in many ways don’t like you. If nothing else it gets you used to living with people that oppose you so you don’t live in a bubble.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I seem to be writing about the <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/06/12/will-the-ipad.html">iPad a bit more</a>, simply because people are thinking and talking about it more following WWDC2021. You can guarantee this always happens at two points, following release of new hardware, and after software updates. Amplify this double of Apple have released a new iPad and then talked about a software update that hasn’t met imaginary predictions. So, currently we are in the middle of a perfect storm, or I guess an imperfect one.</p>
<p>The common consensus seems to be that the iPad needs to move forward and be more like the Mac. There is some long held belief that the iPad Pro must start to deliver everything to everyone, becoming more like a traditional commuter — when in fact the opposite is true.</p>
<p>I love having a iPad because it can do everything I need. If I want to chill out on the sofa and read a bit, or I want to scribble some notes in a meeting it is perfect. I also know that of I need to draw out some design concepts, illustrate a document or connect a keyboard to write out a blog post it can do all that and more — with ease, and most of all simplicity.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/67fb302c3b.jpg" width="600" height="337" alt="" /></p>
<p>I can get in depth and have side by side windows, Slideover ones and picture in picture stuff going on, but I can also open an app in full screen by default and everything else gets out my way. No docks to hide, no menu bars or anything else to worry about — a procrastinators dream.</p>
<p>Some of these feelings come from working on a Mac all day. The iPad feels different and more relaxed, but even when I used an iPad as my main computer I just loved the way it was simple to understand and got where I needed it to go. I wasn’t trying to force a square peg in a round hole, I wasn’t expecting it to do anything more that I needed it to, because when push comes to shove, better tools are available.</p>
<p>I must applaud Apple for achieving this mix of power and simplicity for iPad OS. Every time “someone familiar with the matter” starts to talk about making the iPad like a desktop computer I feel a little bit of dread that the iPad will loose its charm. Push too far towards the work, and loose its way with everything else it is great at. I wish Apple would bring the iPad out into the sun with feature parody, but it doesn’t need anything else to be a great iPad. For everything else, there’s a Mac for that.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Before we get anywhere into this post, I absolutely refuse to start this stupid debate again. I love the iPad, I <a href="/2017/02/19/one-year-of.html">used it as my only device</a> for years, and <a href="/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html">now I use a Mac</a> because it fits my work life better. It is because I love it so much that I appreciate everything it can do for users.</p>
<p><a href="/2021/04/26/where-does-apple.html">As many others did</a>, I sat and watched WWDC2021 and expected the iPad to go up a gear. It did in many ways, but the updates still left many wanting more. I don’t believe users should be up in arms at the exclusion of “pro apps” and screaming for the myriad of features that were never promised by Apple — but with that said the iPad still feels a little stagnant.</p>
<p>Apple can’t or won’t make the iPad too powerful because they want you to buy a Mac too. For proof of this look no further than the upcoming <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/11/how-universal-control-on-ipados-15-and-macos-12-works">Universal control</a>. A feature which feels like an extension of Sidecar, allowing you to move your mouse across the many screens you have at your disposal. Be those Macs or iPads. Yet even <em>this</em> feature isn’t universal at all.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/0c3e382683.jpg" alt="e9e34e7ce2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>You can only use this control <em>from</em> a Mac. So if you were thinking you could use your iPad and move your mouse across to grab a file from a Mac, you have another think coming. Unfortunately Apple still view your iPad as Mac adjacent. A supplementary device that is amazingly powerful but just not <em>quite</em> there.</p>
<p>I worked from an iPad for around 7 years, since before the iPad Pro was even a thing. So I know what an iPad is capable of and I know where it’s limits are. You will get no wild claims from me about where you can and can’t work. Yet the iPad still seems to exist in the shade of the Mac. Not quite achieving its potential.</p>
<p>Seemingly for the fear of cannibalising Apples computer market. The taste left in many users mouths is one that all the moves Apple make are to entice customers to purchase more devices. Hey, they’re a company, that’s the way companies grow. But after years of users waiting and wishing for things I am starting to get the feeling that the prayers will always go unanswered.</p>
<p>Undeniably the iPad makes strives forward each year – some small, some large. Yet the potential is never met, and perhaps never will be. I dream of a world where the iPad steps into the sun and becomes its own thing, because it’s only Apple holding it back now.</p>

     <p>One of the best things about blogging and sharing things on social media is the constant changing environment and shifting your perspective.

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>There are so many things I love about <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36">Twitter</a>. It was the first social network that clicked for me, despite having a Facebook account for a while before hand. The fast moving pace of updates and the activity levels of people that I enjoyed following just made it a place I wanted to be.</p>
<p>When I first started using Twitter I was hacking the iPhone and had a pretty successful side hustle unlocking them and helping others develop Cydia hacks. I was also really deep into Android Twitter building loads of friends that I still speak to all over the globe. I had a place, a constantly changing environment surrounded by people I wanted to deal with. I got hate from Apple fanboys but I didn’t care. This was me and I loved it.</p>
<p>The user base then felt like it was tiny. People that I spoke to in real life didn’t really use Twitter that much, but fast forward to now and it feels like everyone is here. It’s still fast moving, but it’s huge and often times exhausting. So <a href="https://gr36.com/2018/01/20/using-microblog-aka/">I’ve tried to quit</a>, more than <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/01/11/social-media-in/">once</a>. Yet I keep coming back once I feel better, and then it got too much again, and the world goes around because I never learn.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/538e51a027.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Trying to work out what is so exhausting is the puzzling part. Partly it is the speed of information flowing past, <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/04/11/time-to-slow/">slowing down</a> always proves effective. However I have never really ever managed to put my finger on why, until today.</p>
<p>Listening to an episode of ‘You’re wrong about’ <a href="https://gabz.me/2021/06/08/youre-wrong-about.html">recommended by Gabz</a> the concept of “What about…” was given as becoming exhausting and it instantly clicked of me. I love hearing other peoples opinions on things, expressing myself and giving far too many of my own outlooks in replies to tweets — and this is part of the issue. Opinions are something everyone has, and should be happy to share them with others, but when there is <em>so much</em> noise it gets frustrating.</p>
<p>As the host points out, When you tweet your three favorite bagels, someone will come back “but what about Poppy seed..”. The solution is not to <a href="https://guce.techcrunch.com/copyConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_110e3c71-85c4-4d53-9464-8afa519254d0&amp;lang=en-US">stop people from replying to tweets</a>, or limiting them in anyway, because that’s just not Twitter. To be honest I don’t think there is a solution, apart from not using Twitter so much.</p>
<p>I am certainly going to be more aware of the replies I make to others, and simply enjoy the sharing of opinions.Maybe write a blog post or two instead. Replying only when I have something to add, or a question is asked. This isn’t going to stop me going down rabbit holes and wasting time, but it should help my mental health a bit.</p>

  Which world would you like to live in, book-world or twitter-world? – <a href="https://seths.blog/2021/05/a-long-lead-time/">Seth Goodin</a>

<p>There should be a holding cell. What if instead of launching your tweet into the internet its kept to one side, like your drunken texts to an ex, they remain until you confirm your intention to send later on. A get out of jail free card for those tweets you really shouldn’t have sent, and a way to make sure your feelings are straight before you throw your thoughts into the conversation.</p>
<p>How many of your tweets or status updates would be deleted if you had to confirm sending them 12 hours later?</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Using Twitter, I am constantly comparing my insides—my anxieties, fears, and insecurities—with other people’s outward selves: their accomplishments, polished selfies, and edited articles.
</p></blockquote>
<p>You see. We all know this. We all pick the best photos, apply the best filters, and also some use god awful filters that look nothing like them. Yet we don’t see to extrapolate this to others.</p>
<p>The anxiety fuelled by social media is often predicated on the comparison of the expression of others lives to our own. Yet nothing is real! For much of the web, inner selves are not the ones that are on display. The constant battle to win approval by making yourself as appealing, approachable and inoffensive is a pressure felt by all but ignored in equal amounts.</p>
<p>Constant observation is a way of life for some and the next generation looks set to be worse. We have become so used to look at other peoples lives so much that we expect our own to be under the same scrutiny.</p>

<p>This for me is THE biggest issue I have with iPad os. By either inability or oversight, nothing can operate in the background well enough. Dropbox can’t sync correctly, I can’t upload a long video to YouTube very well, and generally doing something complex can suck at times.</p>
<p>It annoys everyone, full time iPad users included, so why the OS still can do this is beyond me.</p>
<p>But what’s the old iPad Pro saying “the next OS update will fix everything”.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I am making my way through the wonderful book “Think Like a Monk” by <a href="https://micro.blog/books/0008386595">Jay Shetty</a>. It’s hard going, because there is so much to think about I have to stop and digest much of what is being introduced. One of the largest ideas I have found beneficial is the idea of a ‘Values Audit’. A dedicated time where you asses where your perceived values fit into your life, and make some conclusions towards your actual values.</p>
<p>For example someone may claim their values are spending time with their family, but can’t put their phone down to interact with their children. Or you claim there is no time to exercise, but spend hours a day watching TV. This can lead you to be self critical, but there is no need, really what comes from this is more shaping of your actions to display what you value the most.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cb5c249012.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" /></p>
<p>As my granddad would always say to me “talk is cheap, actions pay the bills”. It’s free and easy to outline the inner working of yourself in words, but your actions quite often display other things. A recent book I read on called <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781090532084">Ruined by Design</a> by Mike Monterio discussed a similar thing when designers do things they don’t want to do, but fail to stand up for their values. Leading to a large portion of companies implementing manipulative practices, but this doesn’t just apply to designers.</p>
<p>How many of us would take a position or a job that doesn’t fit in to our values. To use myself as an example, would I design for a company that portrayed dark patterns? Would I write for a company that tracked its users and showed loads of adds? Would you?</p>
<p>Of course many of us would. Taking a job simply because it is with a company we want to work for, but doesn’t display any of our values. There is a certain amount of fighting from the inside you can always do working for a company that doesn’t stand <em>for</em> you, and there is no shame or accusation in that. However it’s important to be aware of whats happening and do these value audits regularly.</p>
<p>Being mindful about the practices you have, your outlook on the world around you and most of all, your output into the world. If at all times we can ensure our true inner values are being portrayed and supported, the world would be a much happier place and you will be a much happier person in it.</p>

  In the future, social media giants should bring back more of the human touch. In the real world, trusted individuals curate our museums, galleries and music festivals – why don’t we have the same approach to creative content online?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess this very much depends on the scope of 230. The old definition for the protection was that if you did any moderating then you were liable, but seeing as moderating is a <a href="/2021/04/22/the-problem-of.html">product of scale</a> where does this get to?</p>
<p>Human curation would be lovely to have, it works pretty well on micro.blog, but you very quickly start to see the issues. Bias and control starts to show even at very low levels, so in large scale social media it would become impossible.</p>
<p>We can still dream though. A time where algorithms couldn’t be gamed by spamming content, where people took pride in the content surface on their website, and the cream always rose to the top. Happy time.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I completely missed last week being <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/campaigns/mental-health-awareness-week">mental health awareness week</a> in the UK. A period of time dedicated to making people more aware of mental illness, and perhaps try and remove some of the stigma associated with both suffering with an illness and indeed seeking help. I have been very open about my struggles with my mental health in later life, I only discovered that I had mental health issues later on when I knew what they were.</p>
<p>At a time when I knew what mental health issue were and how to deal with them. For the longest time I had no clue that the ups and downs that I felt were not normal feelings and in fact something to pay attention to. The weird thing that people come to realise when they get to know me personally, is that I am not how I appear online. Despite all the tweeting, the publishing and the podcasting, I am very introverted.</p>
<p>I am outgoing when I need to be, or when required by the situation. I can adapt to almost anything and not worry too much about my internal feelings. But this is usually followed by a need to ‘recharge’ my social batteries that have <a href="/2018/11/13/im-an-outgoing.html">been depleted</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Introverts get their energy by being alone or in small groups, while extroverts get their energy from larger groups of people. – <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147750/social-anxiety-psychology-how-to-be-yourself-ellen-hendriksen-interview">Ellen Hendriksen</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I suffer greatly from big swings in my outlook on life, and the largest take away I have become used to over the last decade is — that’s OK. However. With all the positive things going around about mental health, I still get loads of push back. It’s still normal for people to tell you to “get over it” or “man up”. That is somehow acceptable in the modern age, to dismiss someone because you think their issues are not important.</p>
<p>This isn’t random people either. Many work colleagues and friend are perfectly fine to say these kinds of dismissive things about others mental health, and a few even believe it doesn’t exist!</p>
<p>When things like mental health week come around, it’s easy to think that it is the people that suffer from issues that this week is for. It’s for the people that don’t want to talk about their issues, but I believe it is more for everyone else. No one wants to talk about these things, and accept that they are happening all around us. These weeks are for the people that push back. That tell me to “get on with it” and belittle the way I feel.</p>
<p>It’s OK for me to not be OK – and it’s got sod all to do with you.</p>

  Peter “peterme” Merholz coined the term “blog” as a playful contraction of “web-log” — like a ship’s log in which hardy adventurers upon the chaotic virtual seas could record their journeys.

<p>This makes both perfect sense and is baffling all the same. This puts the act of blogging into a completely new(old) context. The current modern task is to write articles and build a brand to sell. Where as the way blogging should be is to communicate with others and log what you’re doing.</p>
<p>On the flip side of this, Social Media has taken over all of the logging for us, leaving just the longer ‘essays’. Which way around it should be is up to you, but I’d love to see more return to a web-log — wouldn’t you?</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>For the last few months I have been using Roam Research as the powerhouse behind almost everything I do. I’ve written previously of my love for the way it allows me to record my thoughts and everything that goes on in my life. It links very heavily in to both my <a href="/2020/08/21/my-writing-workflow.html">writing workflow</a> and my <a href="/2020/08/22/my-reading-flow.html">reading workflow</a>, and as such has been a huge boost to my working and personal life.</p>
<p>Even with all this praise, I have still always looked for something else. Although it has proved valuable, I don’t love the £195 a year price tag, and I also hate it is only semi available on mobile, and has no offline mode. I’ve tried alternatives, including <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>, but nothing else quite fit the bill, but this time something stuck and I’d like to share my current Obsidian set up, what it does for me and how it could help you.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b06f3598b8.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="what-is-it">What Is It</h2>
<p>Obsidian is, in there own words, a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. It takes many of the things I loved about Roam (I have no idea which one came first), particularly the network of thoughts that link themselves together but makes it local.</p>
<p>This is a huge benefit when you consider that access to something as important as your network of thoughts should be available at all times. I have not experienced issues accessing Roam, but other online apps <em>have</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/evnryg/notion_is_not_loading_site_and_desktop_app/">had these issues</a>. Also consider that I <em>have</em>lost work because Roam has updated itself and not saved my document — and I am <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/gdbq77/how_common_is_data_loss/">not alone</a> with these issues, as rare as they are.</p>
<p>Instead Obsidian builds on top of plain text markdown notes that are stored locally. Granted, this means that you rely on things syncing between devices, so if an internet connection <em>is</em> in short supply you will still have issues. However is means you can create and edit files wherever you are and don’t rely on the cloud. I have my ‘vault’ (more on that later) set up in iCloud that syncs to all of my devices quickly and easily. The text files are kb in size so I have, as yet, not had a single issue.</p>
<h2 id="my-set-up">My Set Up</h2>
<p>As with most platforms promising to boost your networked thought, Obsidian can be as simple or as powerful as you want to be. At its base, you simply point it at a folder, called a vault, containing text files and Obsidian displays them for you. You can put these files into folders of unlimited depth and set them up however you wish. By clicking on a file you display the text within it.</p>
<p>You can link these files together, by using the now very familiar double square bracket ([[]]) or the hashtag #. This allows you to link notes together in non hierarchical order. As in, they can link backwards and forwards as well as to whatever else you wish. Your file name is automatically searched through the vault and any mention of the same thing will be surfaced as an un-linked reference. These can be people, books, films, thoughts, in-fact whatever you want them to be.</p>
<p>My set up is very simple in terms of folder structures, I have one for book notes, one for article notes, one for random notes, and a few others for People, Templates and Podcasts. This is not needed, all of the text files can be left in the root of the vault, but I like a nice clean look on the side. Everything can be searched for anyway, and in many ways you don’t even have to see the files to link them together.</p>

<h3 id="daily-notes">Daily Notes</h3>
<p>My biggest strength now is recording absolutely everything that I need, or want to refer back to later. I used to save these things sporadically in Apple Notes and also Ulysses. Now Obsidian is open constantly while I am at my mac. Every time I open Obsidian it is on my daily note, this contains my daily tasks, meeting notes, Journal entries and almost anything in my life.</p>
<p>When I first sit down in the morning I type out some Morning Notes. This has been my practice for months now and just helps me surface whatever is going on in my brain that morning. I don’t think very much about these, I try and get out of my own way and let my thoughts flow out. Admittedly some of this is repeating trends of how I am feeling, but quite often these thoughts turn into blog posts or just something I work on personally.</p>
<p>My daily note also contains my Routines, these are simple things I am bringing into my daily routine to make myself better. Really simple things like walking the dog, meditating, exercising and anything else I am working on. You create a task by typing <code>- [ ] Task name</code>.</p>
<p>To set up daily notes turn this on in the core plugins. There are also some options in settings to customise this a little. I set up my daily note to start from a Template, so I always have the same headings and tasks to tick off.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2b7999df22.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>I have another area for my aforementioned day notes, this allows me to take brief notes on meetings, telephone calls and also anything else that crops up in the day. I can’t tell you how beneficial this is for emptying my brain and writing down all my tasks.</p>
<h3 id="plugins">Plugins</h3>
<p>While we talk about turning on plugins, now the real power of Obsidian starts to come out. You can use a whole range of plugins created by the community of developers out there that are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Plugins are split into ‘core’ and community. The Core plugins are optional things that Obsidian can do if you wish, and Community plugins are downloadable extensions to do extra things, some simple, some really powerful.</p>
<p>You can also install plugins outside of the app that are easy to discover in their <a href="https://obsidian.md/community">thriving community</a> or their Discord channel. From my experience most people don’t stray outside of the Community plug ins. I use the following heavily.<br />– <a href="https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin">Calendar</a>: This shows a calendar in the right side bar, allowing you to go back to daily notes from those days or make daily notes on dates in the future.<br />– <a href="https://github.com/argenos/nldates-obsidian">Natural Language Dates</a>: This allows you to easily tag things with dates by using <code>@today</code>or <code>@tomorrow</code> or even <code>@next week</code>.<br />– <a href="https://github.com/konodyuk/obsidian-text-expander">Text Expander</a>: Does exactly what it says on the tin. Allowing you to customise short codes and replace them with regularly used bit of text.<br />– <a href="https://github.com/hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin">Kindle Highlights</a>: Syncs by book highlights into my book notes folder in a similar fashion to Readwise.</p>
<p>I have tried to make things as simple as I can, but also molded things to my usage. There are hundreds of community plugins to do loads of things and you can spend days of your life trying them out! One non community plugins that I have to mention will follow because it is the basis of how I get things done.</p>
<h3 id="tasks">Tasks</h3>
<p>As mentioned about you can set tasks up really easily in Obsidian and there are load of plugins to help you manage these and keep ticking those check boxes off. To add a date to a task you simply tag it so for example.<br /><code>- [ ] Do this thing #2021–12–25</code></p>
<p>This will make a task for you to complete that will be linked to the daily note on the 25th December 2021. You can go further and further with this and customise this until your heart is content, but this is task management in Obsidian 101.</p>
<p>Wait, there are plugins though! After using <a href="https://github.com/larslockefeer/obsidian-plugin-todo">Obsidian GTD</a> for a little while I opted to use <a href="https://github.com/schemar/obsidian-tasks">Tasks</a>. The benefit of this was that I can get my set up to display the tasks I have to complete in a way that works for me. I have a note titled tasks that contains code to display my priorities that are overdue, need doing today and those that are upcoming. As well as having an Inbox of sorts by surfacing any task I have not allocated a date to.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3c2265cfd1.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Tasks also allows me to set up repeating tasks and displays the date I completed each task next to the item with a nice green tick emoji — I like that! I leave my Tasks note open in a second page by CMD + click.</p>
<h3 id="book-article-notes">Book &amp; Article Notes</h3>
<p>Ever read something and thought it was great but immediately forgot all about it? Yeah me to, until I started making notes about it. When I read anything in Pocket, or on my Kindle at night, the highlights go into Obsidian for two reasons:<br />1. For me to refer back too later if i need to<br />2. For me to go over and expand on at a later date</p>
<p>These notes may sit doing nothing, or may be expanded on and stored for later reference, either way they are not taking space up in my brain and have not been lost. The Kindle highlight plugin allows me to do this whenever I have finished a book and want write a little about it, if only a mini review. However I transfer over my Pocket highlights once a week or so for reference.</p>
<p>Making notes in this fashion quite often comes out in my daily notes, or my writing later on, because a quick search or a glance at the links tab in the right sidebar will surface any relevant information to me. With a few keystrokes I can make sure these thoughts are connected up and begin to see my knowledge graph forming before my eyes.</p>
<p>I tried this also with Podcast notes, which can be really useful when sycnced through the app <a href="https://www.airr.io">Airr</a>. However since my <a href="/2021/05/12/my-podcast-feed.html">listening declined</a> these have stopped completely.</p>
<p>I was initially dismissive of making notes like this, and still do shy away from going as deep as I could. Some of this is trauma from University and making hours of notes, but some of this is just not what I use Obsidian for, but with that said it’s amazing the difference it has made. Simply by having them there and padding some of them out my recall of the topics discussed has been improved tremendously. If there is one thing I can’t stress it’s don’t me as dismissive as I was. Make loads of notes about everything.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>This is one of the biggest things that I always wanted Roam to be. A place I could write out anything and it be stored and linked to if those topics come up again. Try as I might, I just never got there with Roam. There are options to turn it of, but first and foremost it likes things in bullets and blocks which felt to rigid and strange. Whereas Obsidian is text editor at its core, so writing is a delight.</p>
<p>Everything I have ever written in a text file in my writing folder. Published or not it’s there and can come up again whenever the time is right. Whats more is that all my documents are written in my beloved markdown. So I can type away and never click a mouse button if I don’t need to! My search for a perfect writing app has changed back to storing everything in Markdown in Obsidian, so no more subscriptions. Publishing is as easy at copy and paste into micro.blog and put in my images.</p>
<p>Using the very geeky comandline universal converting service <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/OliverBalfour/obsidian-pandoc">accompanying plugin</a>, I can also export my work documents and things I am working on to docx and pdf as and when required. I don’t really want to get in to setting this up because it is boring, but I might do at some point.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7bbf397c8e.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="mobile">Mobile</h2>
<p>I am lucky enough to have the beta version of the iOS app to test (it is available on Android too). This is a full featured app that works exactly like the desktop version. Meaning I can type in my notes, pull up any information I need, or even work on my iPad!</p>
<p>The fact that a free service got here before a £195 one like Roam did is baffling to me. Bravo on the developers and the community to getting to this stage and deliver such a full featured app with very few caveats.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>And there you have it, my very simple setup in a nut shell. I’d like to cover concisely why Obsidian stuck for me this time, but I really have no idea. Many people I follow have started using it, and as such I gave it a little more time. It’s not Roam Research and that’s ok. I love it even more because its simple to pick up and you can get as geeky as you like.</p>
<p>I have recently discovered some more plugins that I am experimenting with for creating templates and moving things even further forward. But for now the real benefit I get from this is being able to open it each morning and use it all day for the things it does best — recording my thoughts and linking them for me.</p>

<p>Last week the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_(2021_film)">Mortal Kombat</a> film launched, but only in the US! This isn’t exactly a blockbuster film but something I really want to watch given my love of the old one, and the game. Understandably filmmakers are having to find new ones to generate the income they deserve for the films they make, but they seem to be tone-deaf when it comes to limiting releases.</p>
<p>The film is available to buy and stream in the US, but nowhere else. Meaning that everyone outside the US cannot watch it unless they adopt illegal means. No doubt many people will resort to this to watch, but I prefer to make sure content creators receive the money they deserve. However, I don’t want to wait.</p>
<p>Is there an ethical middle ground? Is it OK to pirate a film if you then buy it when it comes out to give back? There is no reason viewers outside the US should wait for an indeterminate amount of time, and it is almost impossible for me to avoid people talking about it. This is a hard question, and no doubt many people will just watch the film for free.</p>

<p>Maple Cocaine <a href="https://twitter.com/maplecocaine/status/1080665226410889217?lang=en">on Twitter on Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each day on Twitter there is one main character. The goal is to never be it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Such a simple few words seems to have captured so much of my feelings towards social media and Twitter specifically . Every day there is something else for the different levels of twitter to get emotional about. Those emotions are almost always negative and hateful in their tone.</p>
<p>There isn’t outpouring of positivity and creation like there was a few years ago. This has something to do with the surrounding world, but everything to do with the emotions people put into Twitter. I do still use it, but shy away from much conversation due to not wanting to occupy myself with it more than needed.</p>
<p>I want very much to curate my social media garden to be more pleasant, but somethings just seem to break through. This week it was Basecamp, next week it will be something else. The rage machine keeps on working if you like it or not.</p>

This is the basis of making your mind more inquisitive to look for information and understand everything fully instead of defending your beliefs.</p><p>I wrongly presumed that this was obvious to everyone, and then immediately realised that I was defending my static position already. I started to think about what happens when your beliefs become so ingrained in you that they become part of your personality. Are you the Apple guy? The Android girl? The iPad dude?</p><p>When your very person is framed by something you believe in, how can you ever hope to look at anything with a scout mindset. I’ve been guilty of this in the past, and projected my own bias onto many different things. We all have these things in us that we believe in, but the real thing to take away from this approach is to be mindful of them and make sure it doesn’t cause you to miss any information or mean you’re defending your position because you feel like it’s personal.</p><p>Beliefs don’t have to be permanent.</p>

<p>Of course over the last few weeks I have been going backwards and forwards over podcasting again, but this is not more rumination. Instead it is emotion towards lost relationships, at least one sided ones.</p>
<p>During my 5 years working around the UK I spent a rough average of 5 hours a day driving, often much more. This time was always filled with podcasts. Each time I turned the key, after a few seconds pause my trusty Ford CMax (I had three of them in a row) was filled with my chosen episodes.</p>
<p>Hours and hours of my life I spent listening to Podcast personalities that taught me so much. They were my introduction to tech, to working on an iPad, my glimpse into brand new ways of thinking and new topics for me to become interested in. As the miles rolled on, I devoured whole episodes of my favorite shows over and over. The hosts shared personal insights with me, and we built up and very one sided relationship. I felt invested in them as podcasts and also individuals.</p>
<p>When my working life changed these dropped away, and as COVID hit they disappeared completely. These relationships my mind had built were severed and almost all of which I have no interest in now. It was only when compiling a list of <a href="/2021/05/12/my-podcast-feed.html">my podcast feed now</a> that I realised how many people have slipped out of my life.</p>
<p>I am filled with a strange melancholic feeling towards these shows and people. I am thankful for everything I have learnt and the interests I have found, but realised this was all one sided. All of a sudden understand people that become obsessed with people from TV shows than mean something to them.</p>

<p>I’ve changed my morning routine little by little over the last few weeks and it has made a huge difference.</p>
<p>I feel like I am stealing the idea a little, because Matt D’Avella made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIIGCTIpRMk&amp;t=198s">brilliant video about small changes</a> at the end of last year which inspired me so I cant take the full credit.  However after months of searching on how to put good habits into my life, it seems I have found the answer — slow and steady wins the race.</p>
<p>Introducing small, achievable things to do each day is the key to making much bigger changes in your life. I started with small things like meditate and go for a walk, setting a reminder each day and ticking them off. This soon evolved into exercising each morning and walking the dog before 7am by just moving slowly.</p>
<p>I have always wondered why people get obsessed by successful peoples morning routines. Perhaps they are trying to find something in them that will change their own life and make them successful too. This is bonkers, but I am in a different mindset to morning routines now. You don’t need to go all out, but changing small things can really set you up for the day. I was in no rush to change everything and not be able to keep it up, but just one new thing every couple of weeks has been a huge revelation.</p>
<p>What small, achievable thing could you do to improve your day?</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s been a while since I listened to podcast as intently as I used to. Somewhere in 2019 I fell off a bit as I didn’t have to drive as much, and the pandemic <a href="/2020/10/18/podcasts-and-me.html">just killed almost all of my listening</a>. The empty space I used to fill with talking and chatting about tech is not just empty but I’t still consuming up a little <a href="/2021/02/15/why-do-i.html">while running</a> or walking the dog. Chris Wilson <a href="/2021/02/15/why-do-i.html">pestered me into</a> writing about what I am listening to, so here it is!</p>
<h2>Wired UK</h2>
<p>The only Tech thing I listen to now is a good round up of tech news that is actually interesting. It got a bit too much in the pandemic due to talking about research and related things to do with COVID but its back to its best. No spec stuff, no wild rumors to get emotional about, just stories and insight about how tech is changing the world. If you like the magazine, you’ll <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/podcasts">love the podcast</a>.</p>
<h2>Duncan Trussell Family Hour</h2>
<p>My favorite person, perhaps on the planet (don’t tell my wife) never fails to entertain. With in-depth talk about life, reality, religion, psychedelics and almost anything goes. His insight into how he looks at the world has affected me deeply since discovering him on Joe Rogan a few years ago – <a href="http://www.duncantrussell.com">I never miss an episode</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c35764757c.jpg" width="666" height="307" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Vox Conversations</h2>
<p>This is a new one for me, I have only been listening a couple of weeks but have gone back and devoured a lot of the back catalog. It’s very political in places, and offers a very slanted view of the world, but has introduced me to some really good books and interesting people. I particularly enjoyed the recent episode on <a href="https://www.vox.com/vox-conversations-podcast">Satanic conspiracies in the US</a>.</p>
<h2>Tim Ferris</h2>
<p>What more is there to say about this podcast, it’s really great. I do dip in and out due to not having the attention or time for a 2hour + conversation but they are always a great listen. Tim has a great way of interviewing and bringing the very best our of people. His <a href="https://tim.blog/2020/10/27/yuval-noah-harari/">show with Yuval Noah Harari</a> changed my outlook on life completely.</p>
<h2>Darknet Diaries</h2>
<p>If you’re following me and not <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com">listening to Darknet</a> I don’t know what you’re doing with your life. This is one of my very favorite. It scratches my tech itch but in a completely different way. The story telling behind some of the greatest hacks in the world, and also some you’ve never heard of ,never fails to grab me.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  They really don’t care what employees have to say. If they don’t think it’s an issue, it’s not an issue
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of all the words in this excellent write up these speak volumes to me. We’ve all seen this arrogance recent years, the ego that runs amok in the founders comes and bites them on the ass.</p>
<p>When you don’t listen to feedback, when you think all your ideas and experiences are the only ones that matters, you have a real issue. Running a company in your vision and being thick skinned enough to stand by your decisions is one thing. But when the success goes to your head and you become tone deaf to everyone but the chip on your shoulder sooner or later that will catch up to you.</p>
<p>I am in no doubt Basecamp is not going anywhere, there will be thousands of people itching to take over these positions that don’t care. They just want a foot in the door. However if this knock tells the founders one thing, it should be that they are not as great as they think they are. Listening to people doesn’t mean you take the advice or feedback, but means you must at least appreciate where your employees and users are coming from.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  During the pandemic, he says, many people have sought comfort in the snacks they remember from childhood. “We went into the store, and we started buying products we hadn’t had since we were kids,” he says — recalling “great joyous moments.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s only when you step back and look around when buying food you realise that a sorry state the world is in.</p>
<p>Our brains and bodies have been hacked by nostalgic food, bright colours and gimmicks to a point of almost no return. A point further highlighted by the pandemic as we all reached for something that made us feel better and take our mind of the doom and gloom.</p>
<p>This is fine in the short term but when you look at all the psychology used by brands it’s reminiscent of social media manipulation. The whole world is out to sell us something and to hell with the repercussions.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I don’t need to resort to tropes to tell anyone how hard the last year has been. Since COVID-19 hit the UK like a train (no political discussion please) we’ve been in lockdown longer than I can ever remember. This has been hard on us all, but one for the weird consequences of this has been my contact with other people. I’ve only been able to see the outside world through Social Media — and that sucks!</p>
<p>I’ve spoken before about missing just being around others, and the <a href="/2020/08/20/missing-a-good.html">lack of physical contact</a> that I think humanity needs to survive. I have been talking, interacting and looking at everyone though the smokey lens of the online world for so long I forgot how great people actually are.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get disillusioned about the way of the world. More so when your bombarded with the worst that it has to offer, what feels like a constant stream of bad news and outrage with some random conspiracies thrown in for good measure. It’s only when getting back to some semblance of normal that it all starts to make sense. As the country opens back up again, I can now start to talk to people in person. Laugh and joke almost like old times that you begin to realise that the world is a much more positive pace when you remove all the digitals in between.</p>
<p>There is nothing like real people, in a real situation that brightens things up. Makes humanity seem great again and improve the despair felt when staying at home. I’ve got through the latest lockdowns with a few scrapes and metal bruises but being able to get out and about again is brilliant. These Smokey lens I have looking at the world through have been lifted, and I am forever grateful.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Despite it being a standard feature in many Android phones it took Apple until the iPhone XS to implement <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT209044">a dual sim of sorts</a>. Even then you need to have one as an eSim and that limits the networks that can support it. Thankfully EE were one of the first, so for the last few years I have been using two sims in my iPhone, one for work and one for personal.</p>
<p>One major pain is dealing with moving phones. I do that quite a bit, so ordering a paper EE eSim each time became a pain, not to mention an expense at £1.50 a time. Preplanning helps a little, but there has still been times I’ve been without service because I’ve broken my phone and can’t just pop my sim in another.</p>
<p>Thankfully EE have a solution, and you can now download an EE eSim for your iPhone in seconds! Here’s how to do a digital EE eSim swop.</p>
<p>You will need your current sim to be working to receive a text message, and also have already set up your new handset and downloaded the <a href="https://ee.co.uk/ee-and-me/my-ee-app">My EE app</a>.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e6f6966773.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Once you’ve done that on your new phone in the My EE app, open the menu and go to Settings &gt; Device and SIM &gt; Replace my SIM &gt; and select your number.</p>
<p>You will then have two options on supporting devices, SIM card — Post (2 to 4 days) at a cost of £1.50. Or eSim — instant download at a cost of 50p.</p>
<p>Tap on eSim, then select this device, and you’ll be on your way to transferring your number.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2e4f4fff01.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>You will then get a notification that the eSim is ready to download, and then you can go through the normal set up options. This gives you the facility to choose labels for the numbers, which iMessage number is used and lots of others. Once completed you will need to activate the new sim by receiving a text to your old phone, put the supplied code into the app on your new phone, and you’re ready to go.</p>
<p>This is usually instant but can take up to  an hour, turn your new phone off and on again to refresh everything, and you’re good to go on your new handset with a new EE eSim.</p>
<p>Head into Settings &gt; Mobile data to change any of the options you’re selected on set up. If in any doubt call 150 from a working EE phone.</p>

  I can see reviews coming a mile away claiming that the M1 chip is overkill for the iPad Pro and that it isn’t worth the same price as the MacBook Air, or that users should save money on the iPad Pro and just get the MacBook Air instead. As of right now, I can’t come up with any new arguments on behalf of the iPad than I had before this announcement. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>I can’t point at anything that moves the needle on being compelled to buy a new iPad. Even when compared to the 2018 version your pretty much getting the same thing, bar a camera and mini LED on the 12.9”.</p>
<p>I’m not sure either of things are needed by most people that use an iPad, but that’s a personal thing. No doubt the M1 is amazingly powerful but nothing changes at the moment. We keep holding our breath for a sea change in usability from iPad OS. Yet each you comes and goes with nothing bar a few tweets or changing the <a href="/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html">multitasking again</a>!</p>
<p>I’m not even sure what that is. Where does Apple go with iPad OS without compromising more than they add in? I’m lost for ideas but please Apple. Do something. Shock me. Surprise me. Make a £1000 investment worth it.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Following Apples move to offer Podcasters subscriptions to help increase revenue for podcasters, and also grab some cash for themselves, the doors will begin to slam shut. Granted we’ve already seen some try and muscle into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515840/luminary-podcast-startup-proxy-server-show-takedown">exclusive podcasts</a>, Spotify tries to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52736364">tie up some creators</a> and podcast producers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17314866/pocket-casts-podcast-app-acquisition-npr-wnyc-wbez-this-american-life">buy up applications</a>, but I have a feeling it’s going to get a lot worse.</p>
<p>Instead of offering something built on top of a secure RSS feed, Apple have chosen to close it down entirely. Should you choose to make your Podcast more premium and charge your listeners, you will have to upload the audio straight to Apple. Closing off any chance of the show being available in another app, and removing RSS entirely.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5425e7bf4c.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Anchor The Feed</h2>
<p>I am no lover of podcast platform Anchor, and have been outspoken about their practices, but this <a href="https://mignano.medium.com/podcasting-rss-openness-and-choice-50223b1f16d0">recent post</a> from its founder seems to be the most sensible move. Instead of launching a service to tie everything down, he talks about the love of the openness of the RSS-based industry, but also the issues that comes with it.</p>
<p>Each platform that hosts content will have no choice to make a grab for premium content creators. Not because that is who they should be appealing to, but because they can’t miss out on it. Left unchecked Apple could not only take money from subscribers. They will also cut out advertisers, hosting platforms and even apps in their own App Store.</p>
<p>It’s understandable that <a href="https://ljpuk.net/2021/04/22/its-time-to-leave-anchor/">some podcasters</a> will start to get a bit jumpy, but most of these things are motivated by continued attempts to control the market. Open podcasting won’t go away, but the type of content that is available for free, or indeed in the place you want to consume it <em>will</em> dry up over time. We are well and truly in the boom time of audio focused content, which after a year of stalling due to COVID-19 could be a refreshing change.</p>
<p>However, I have a feeling the market will right itself. This has happened to TV, video and blogging before, but there was still enough out there to consume. Perhaps those of us that have been listening for years have just had too much time in the sun? I don’t believe its time to get worried, there are a huge number of podcasters out there that are working away for free that deserve to be better supported. It’s time to wait and see, and support the creators you think need it most.</p>

     <p>One thing that constantly surprises me on micro.blog is how nice people are. This has something to do with the barrier to entry being a bit nerdy, but everything to do with the scale of the platform. Although everyone seems to think that abuse and harassment is something unique to the main social networks, it’s actually a problem of scale.</p><p>You see I love micro.blog (<a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/why-microblog/">it took me a while</a>) with my main appreciation being that it’s <em>not</em>where everyone is. Sure, I’d like more people to post it, I’d love to follow more interesting people, but with all the noise comes issues. My feed is filled with thoughtful comments, far too much debate about <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/this-is-how/">what platform to publish too</a>, and nice photos. There is a positive vibe to the place, so much so that there appears to be no movement towards thinking about moderation.</p><p>The platform can be independent of the publishing platforms, so a swift move to remove cross posting would be easy to do, as well as removing hateful comments. This lax approach seems to be shared by every new approach and always fails to work, at scale.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All social apps grow until you need a newsfeed<br />All newsfeeds grow until you need an algorithmic feed<br />All algorithmic feeds grow until you get fed up of not seeing stuff/seeing the wrong stuff &amp; leave for new apps with less overload<br />All those new apps grow until...</p>— Benedict Evans (@benedictevans) <a href="https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/955539670103859200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2018</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>I would already kill for better timeline organisation. Sure there is no incentive to move to algorithms that engage users more due to the paid nature of the platform. Stepping away from micro.blog, it’s obvious where the trend goes for almost every other social platform that attempts to be moderation free. I am lucky in the fact I have placed my eggs in a basket I trust, Manton and the team have no reason to do anything other that tend to this nice positive garden they have created. Others are not so lucky.</p><p>Almost every platform that attempts to be a <em>safe place</em> for a certain type of person falls flat on their face with this problem of scale. You can promise to be moderation free, or simply not have the time to do it, but the fact is it’s impossible to run a platform that doesn’t have to do moderation.</p><p>Start with the spam you’ll inevitably get once there are enough users. Then the things you legally have to take down — abuse, copyright material etc. Once you reach a critical mass of users, then comes the algorithmic feed decisions due to lack of engagement and inability for users to keep up. This too is an inevitability as users can’t decide if their posts will be seen or not and start to post less if action isn’t taken.</p><p>All platforms that need engagement or show adverts will devolve into the same state eventually. Nothing will ever ‘fix’ social media. Scale kills almost everything, there is a huge benifit to <strong>not</strong> being where everyone is. Stay small.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’d like to say this was in my younger years, but until fairly recently I bought loads of stuff because I thought I wanted it. Wasted thousands on tech purchases and waved any dismissive thoughts away with the reasoning that it was my only vice. Upgraded my phone, tablet, computer, and anything I could get my hands on almost constantly in a search for something better. When in fact it wasn’t better it was looking for, it was an answer.</p>
<p>The next model of iPhone was always the one that would fill what I was looking for. No? It must be the next one coming in a few months then, or maybe I needed an iPad to go with it. Whatever the feelings left after the hit of dopamine had subsided, it was explained away with buying something else.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f77b66b4b3.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" /></p>
<p>That wasn’t what I was searching for though, I wanted something to fill another hole in myself. It didn’t matter what the hole was, but I filled it with buying tech. Simply because I thought it made me look cool on the internet. Although every upgrade offered me <em>something</em>, these things are not what I needed. What I, and load of people like me, needed was to get to the root of what I really wanted. What was I trying to mask and fill with buying things?</p>
<p>It wasn’t until discovering minimalism that I became aware fo the feelings I had. Like many people I talk to, the <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80114460">Netflix documentary</a> introduced me to a way of looking at the more essential things in life. Thinking much harder about the things I choose to put in it. This isn’t an advert for minimalism, but the message given is a powerful one. The thing I needed was not a thing at all, and for different people it is different things — but one thing links us all, it’s not stuff we need.</p>
<p>These feelings haven’t gone away, I don’t think they ever will. They are still there, I bought every size of iPhone <a href="/2020/11/21/the-iphone-line.html">simply because I could</a>, but how I deal with them is different. Being aware of feelings and the reasons behind them has been an important step in improving my overall happiness and seems to have curbed the never-ending search for fulfilment. Much simpler things make me content now, and when these pangs of purchases come I ride them out and think about what the root cause really is. It’s me.</p>

     <p>Last year I wrote about my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-cant-go">desire to move completely away from smartphones</a> in general and detach myself from the internet as much as I could. With this comes the juxtaposition and the realisation with the fact that I work online, and simply need access to things a smartphone can do most of the time.</p><p>Despite <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-iphone-line">flirting with every size iPhone 12</a> I have stuck with the 12 mini and this has enabled me to go back as far as I can. With a few tweaks such as <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-phone-has">moving my phone out of my room</a>, I have enabled myself to deal with the internet at prescribed times, and in ways I want to.</p><p>This is no fault of the internet. These issues are in me, but also affect those around me. These issues are completely self-made. It’s not the apps I have installed. It’s not the designers fault. It’s not anyone else’s fault. It’s mine. Because I feel bad, I think that it’s outside things making me feel this way and I look for a fix. A quick one preferably, to stop this constant pressure I feel. Instead of working on myself and understanding the triggers.</p><p>A smaller phone has helped me not reach for it as much. As has moving it out of my sleeping space. They are not the cause of my issues, but a way of me fixing them and understanding my triggers. I have gone back as far as I can, and I am much happier than I ever have been, not because of a smartphone, just because I am the person I want to be.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Justin Tadlock discussing the <a href="https://wptavern.com/yes-comments-are-still-relevant-but-we-need-a-better-system">relevancy of comments</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Commenting on and discussing ideas in an open forum can change hearts and minds. It can lead to discoveries and create life-long friendships — I still routinely chat with people I met through blogs and their comments from nearly two decades ago.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I love comments, but then I don’t really have much of a community outside of friends I’ve met online. Outside a few spambots I have never received anything other than nice feedback or healthy debate. But…</p>
<p>Comments on popular platforms such as YouTube can be an absolute dumpster fire. As someone who publishes videos for my day job I am constantly removing comments on videos that showcase the worst that humanity has to offer.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Ryan McCue, a core contributor to WordPress, said that <a href="https://twitter.com/rmccue/status/1375873040496594946" title="comments should be a plugin">comments should be a plugin</a>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I strongly agree with this, the default option for anything on a blog, web, video whatever should be comments off, and you turn them off by default.</p>
<p>Openness when being able to choose a comment provider should also be the de facto stance from all platforms. If I want to move hosts or anything else, I want to take my comments with me.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  McCue’s response was to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Krogsgard/status/1375867036102971396" title="tweet by Brian Krogsgard">tweet by Brian Krogsgard</a>, the Post Status creator and editor. “WordPress should have one singular button that says: Turn off all comments and comment displays. This is so hilariously complicated, it’s absurd.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Comments on WordPress are so far behind where they should be it’s a joke at this point. Dating the way they look and feel is impossible without editing core WordPress files and good luck in understanding what options do what. I spent a good few hours configuring Webmentions as comments and allowing them to be displayed, when it would have been a 2-minute job.</p>
<p>I, the publisher should own the comments the same as I own my content, so making them a plugin would be the perfect move. Don’t even get me started on the non movement of <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35435" title="ticket for supporting webmentions">implementing Webmention</a> after 5 years.</p>
<p>Comments should be part and parcel of your life online. However, all roads point to something better. You will get fools, but you’ll get them on social media anyway, but better tool are needed to breathe life back into something so important to the web.</p>

  And finally, it has been a healthy reminder that the internet can push anyone down a rabbit hole towards believing something false. We all try to be rationale people, and we’re all convinced that what we believe is reasonable and other people are crazy, but none of us are above being pushed into weird (and sometimes dangerous) beliefs with just a few clicks.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I constantly read that people that believe in conspiracy theories or have outlying views on the world are stupid and should know better. If you fall for miss information, or just form your views a bit differently to others then you almost deserve it because you’re dumb. That may be the case for the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ideas-jason-pontin-less-speech/">weird and wonderful</a>, but as Matt points out above its really hard to work out what’s true on the internet.</p>
<p>As much as on the internet no one knows you’re a dog, no one knows your true intent for what you publish. Everyone falls down these holes, and it’s important to remember that.</p>

<p>Living inside an algorithm, like we all do, has no upsides. We are all stuck seeing everything that people ‘like us’ are doing. Ourselves reflected back at us and informing the choices we make next. We’re pigeonholed and controlled by an algorithm that makes it almost impossible to break out of.</p>
<p>Even when we do, and come across someone who doesn’t have the same feelings towards things we do, trouble is bound to happen. Other people don’t understand us as much as the machines, and as such other view points get us upset. The world online thinks the same as us, so why doesn’t the larger world outside?</p>
<p>This is further exaggerated when you live in somewhere like Silicon Valley where the online world is built by the people in your outside world. Shudder.</p>

No matter how great the universe is when you look around you, there are always ones that appear better. You can stare at the photos, read the words and watch the videos and never fail pick out things you wish for your own. It’s easy to see positives in others but not in yourself.</p>
<p>Even if the portrayal is far from the truth. Others internet lives are, on the surface, perfect. Everyone else is always living their best life, enjoying things better than your experiences or doing a better job of it anyway. Almost everything appears better on the outside. The grass always appears greener, but the grass is fake.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see — Henry David Thoreau
</p></blockquote>
<p>The surface is an easy place to observe, it’s the place easy for us to understand, free of the complexities that lie just beneath it. We cannot take everything in, there is simply too much information for us to process, so we focus instead on what we wish to see, and when a lot of what we see is airbrushed it’s impossible to see negatives.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/507fba3ac7.jpg" width="333" height="222" alt="" /></p>
<p>This isn’t a new problem, it’s easy to <a href="/2020/09/09/its-not-the.html">blame the internet</a>, but the internet is full of content others publish. After all, why would you want to show pictures of yourself not in the best light, or having a bad time? What a weird Instagram that would be if the images were what people were <em>actually</em> doing every day. As much as the modern phrase of “it’s OK to not be OK” is spoken, it is not OK to not be your best on the internet.</p>
<p>You can speak of pressure from beauty standards, advertising, and more modern-day worries until you ar blue in the face. The self-fulfilling prophecy is unbreakable, until you realise that this is all fake. It’s easy to see positives, it’s easy to focus on the worries you already have, and it’s natural to see what you want to see.</p>
<p>Your feed is the edited highlights, and so is everyone else’s. Wishing for other lives, other bodies, others income is easy when all you see are the nice bits.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Whilst trying to up my <a href="/2021/02/15/why-do-i.html">running</a> millage now the weather is better, I am forever having to tell myself to slow down. My legs are stuck in this weird pace that I can handle for 10k but not for much longer and I have a habit of blowing up with too many miles to go. A lesson I should have learnt by now, but one that doesn’t just stop at running. I also have a sustained habit of <a href="/2021/02/16/cross-posting-to.html">tweeting too fast</a>, thinking too fast and hitting projects too hard too soon.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dd1cfee040.jpg" width="600" height="403" alt="" /></p>
<p>Try as I might, I just can’t slow myself down some times. I haven’t expanded the internal monologue that happens whist running to the rest of my life. It’s a lesson that I have read quite a <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/twitter-idea-delayed-tweets/">few times</a> lately and one I needed to add my support too. I have recently been introduced to the GTD tag of “<a href="https://productivityist.com/using-energy-levels-as-contexts/">high energy</a>” and this makes perfect sense to me. Don’t go hard all the time, slow down and go hard when you can.</p>
<p>Slow doesn’t mean as slow as possible it just means slower than you might expect. Doing things at the correct pace is one of life’s biggest lessons. That pace is going to be different for different people, and different times of day and hell even different periods of time. We are constantly encouraged to move faster, work harder and fill every waking moment with something that others deem important. When in fact it’s time to slow down, do things properly and maintain them for longer.</p>
<p>When it comes to tweeting, maybe just don’t instead.</p>

Motivated by my desire to take more advantage of the time spent engrossed in a book or catching up on my queue of online articles. This doesn’t matter when and where I am doing this, but one thing I’ve come to rely on is highlighting and being able to read them back.</p>
<p>Only when testing two new upcoming reading apps (super top secret sorry) that are yet to implement highlights that I realised how important they are. Without even thinking I draw my finger across the screen to highlight a specific sentence or passage that I want to remember. When that doesn’t happen, I don’t feel like I am getting the best I can out of this experience.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b0c949c9ae.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" /></p>
<p>Many things slide past without needing to be highlighted, but more than a few times I have had to put the article into another app so I can save the highlights for later. I <em>could</em> try to do this with <a href="/categories/shortcuts/">Shortcuts</a>, but there is something about being able to see what you’ve read and which bits are important. Remember how satisfying it felt to bust out the marker and highlight things on your school texts?</p>
<p>These highlights typically end up on social media, lead to a<a href="https://gr36.com/categories/link-posts/">link post</a> or are saved to refer to later. <a href="https://readwise.io">Readwise</a> definitely helps with pushing these into <a href="/2020/08/21/how-to-start.html">Roam</a> for me, but there are a huge number of ways to read these highlights back and let the information sync in better. If you are thinking about using a service, or creating a new one, highlighting should be top of your list.</p>
<p>Not everything needs highlighting, but everything needs to be able to be highlighted.</p>

<p>I don’t know if it’s because I’m blinkered by my life online but I spent this whole post thinking about how this relates to blogging and writing.</p>
<p>Over the years I wasted so much time messing around with my blog that I spent less time putting out posts — and I know <a href="https://micro.blog/JeffPerry/11240196">others do this too</a>.</p>
<p>That’s not what people come for. Sure a nice blog design makes it easier to read things, but there’s little point if there is nothing to read anyway. The system is less important than the things we put into it, so do that first before worrying.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>For at least the last 4 years, each night I have taken off my Apple Watch, and placed it on a charger next to my bed along with my iPhone. So for the time I am asleep, or at least <a href="/2021/02/01/113519.html">trying to be</a>, my phone is within arms reach on a standup charger.</p>
<p>This helps tremendously as I always have a bedside clock on hand that glows with a subtle bump to the table, and I can be at the mercy of my alarm within a few seconds. But it also means that at any point I can reach over and entertain myself when I should be sleeping.</p>
<p>We’ve all done it. “Just Checking” Twitter before going to bed and an hour disappears as you <a href="/2020/09/09/its-not-the.html">descend a rabbit hole</a>. Or perhaps you see it light up as a notification comes in, and now you’re fully awake because the supermarket had a great offer for you at 2am. Thankfully I am one of the lucky ones that doesn’t need to be contactable at night, but I’ve only just realised that moving your phone into another room is the way to go.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/97204c6340.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" /></p>
<p>It was only through pure accident that the realisation hit me. I was ‘between’ phones and having to use an <a href="/2021/02/24/185046.html">iPhone SE 2016</a> that relied on wired charging. As such it lived in my separate office for a couple of days until my new one arrived. Meaning everything was left until the morning, the extra effort to get out of bed, cross the hallway and retrieve my phone meant that I just left it alone.</p>
<p>That bit of extra space meant I slept better, felt better and the difference was so stark that despite no longer relying on a charging cable, my phone dock now lives in the other room permanently. I hope it likes its new living space, along with all the accessories that go with it. I still do grab it sometimes but much less than before. I wish I had done this sooner.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’m at risk of starting to sound like a broken record. This strange habit exists in me that I want to do loads of things but just never quite get around to them. I want to make videos, have a podcast, and publish loads of blog posts. The truth is I have no reasoning for wanting to do any of these things though, other than posting to the internet.</p>
<p>There is no desire in me to preserve my life in writing or video. No need to spread my garbled messages with the world. I have no knowledge grater than anyone else on this planet and, in fact, considerably less than most. I just <em>want</em> to do these things, but at points it sometimes feels like my job.</p>
<p>Don’t confuse this with lack of enjoyment. I love doing the things I do, and in many respects that <em>is</em> my motivation. However, giving myself a hard time because I have not fulfilled these desires is not what I am about either. There is a tendency for those like me to beat themselves up for not posting enough. Not producing enough content for the web as if this is our jobs. As if we are placed on the planet to feed the internet with our stuff completely free and as often as possible.</p>
<p>Sure. If it is your job, then carry on! For the most of us thought it’s simply the enjoyment that lasts. There shouldn’t be any bad feelings about what tools you use, what things you like doing or what you get up to. You don’t have to post regularly, or do it a certain way, or cover certain things.</p>
<p>It’s not your job to posts to the internet and it sure as hell <a href="https://simonwoods.online/2021/03/26/posting-things-to.html">shouldn’t feel like one</a>. Feel free to post <a href="/2021/04/04/write-about-anything.html">exactly what you want</a>, as often or infrequently as you want. You don’t have to feel like you <em>need</em> to do anything. The enjoyment of doing it is enough without any pressure.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  It’s giving a lecture about the problems you’re pondering in the shower; it’s thinking out loud about the ways in which your project doesn’t work at all. It’s so much of Twitch. I want to see the process. I want to see you trim the artichoke. I want to see you choose the color palette. Anti-marketing.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I love reading other people processes. It’s the reason I share some of my own because I think others like it too. It gives me a glimpse into the lives of different people and allows me to adapt my own with practices I think might help.</p>
<p>I also love it when people talk about the things that don’t work. The changes made or the work they did that shouldn’t happen and had to be adapted. It stops me falling into similar pitfalls or gives me other ways of thinking. Sharing thoughts and ideas about the work before the result as it happens also helps me to understand the work and the thoughts that go into building products.</p>
<p>If we can peek behind the curtain we can also understand the decisions made and become closer to the project.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I have seen people over the last few days start to wonder what to write about on their blog. Asking questions about the topics they cover and also publishing posts about <a href="https://chrishannah.me/the-evolution-of-what-i-write-about/">what they aim to do</a>. It’s great to see more people typing out words and realising that it really doesn’t matter what you write about.</p>
<p>Personal blogs are a strange thing, they are not new, they’ve been a round since pretty much the invention of the internet. For some reason or another they seem to be making a resurgence. Perhaps it’s the increased distrust in the places that bloggers left for, namely social media and others that aim to monetise you without paying you.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/075c937ade.jpg" /></p>
<p>It could be a concoction of many reasons. The positive is they are coming back. Sure, they have never gone away for many people, but lots more are opening up to the idea of publishing things themselves. So many great platforms exist now where you don’t need special skills to publish, and you don’t need to brand yourself either.</p>
<p>The need for a name or logo or fancy design is loosing its trend as publishing gains more relevance from your personal experience and your opinions. Citizen journalism has become immensely relevant as people lose confidence in main stream media, but are also becoming more closed off to outside ideas. So more people writing about more things and their personal experience of them can only lead to positive things.</p>
<p>Pick a platform and do it. Let me know what’s going on in your life, the pictures you take, the articles you read and the thoughts you have on them. There are enough publications out there writing news, or reviews or whatever pays the bills. The internet needs your voice, however you see fit to share it. Cover everything and anything and publish it.</p>

After all, on social media we can all be experts in whatever we want.

A culture of push things, including code and tweets, that you can always fix later. It seems semi logical, fast paced means <a href="https://boz.com/articles/bus-problem">more progress in a round about way</a> — but there is something to be said about missing the bus.</p>
<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with the Social Media platforms that we currently have, but they instil in us this need to move fast and do things without thinking.</p>
<p>How many times have you written out a tweet only to realise there is absolutely no point in it? I bet quite a few times, and if you paused a bit more that number would rise dramatically. Why don’t you try missing the bus a few times and see what happens.</p>

     <p>I don’t remember the first time I thought about killing myself. It has to have been too long ago for my mind to recall, or it’s blocked from my conscious thought. I do remember the ups and downs of earlier life.</p><p>For the longest time I thought what I felt was just how everyone else felt. There wasn’t an even level of happiness, nowhere near. It was a constant wave of highs and lows that was impossible to predict. I was never truly happy, not for long, just surfing the ups and preparing for the downs.</p><p>I felt useless a lot of the time. Spending far too much time on my own and teaching myself about the world. I didn’t feel a purpose and never experienced a calling towards anything. Meaning that as I stumbled through my existence I questioned what it was all for. If I wasn’t happy, what was the point in being like this for decades more. The idea of fading away was certainly one I have entertained numerous times.</p><p>In this early life I was too scared to action anything. The imagined pain of actually committing anything was more than the pain I felt and so logically it didn’t make sense. In more recent years the notion of the pain I would leave behind for my family replaced that of physical pain, and far outweighed any opposing desires I had. There was never a point where the balance tipped over, and thus the idea always stayed an idea; but one that never went away fully.</p><p>Returning occasionally to remind me that I was somehow different from everyone else. That my existence was destined to be one of ups and downs, and that was just how my life was. It wasn’t until reading <a href="/2021/03/27/just-started-the.html">The Midnight Library</a> that I managed to put these thoughts into a coherent expression and feel able to express them.</p><p>To this day I don’t know if other people feel the same; because I’ve never spoken of it. I deal with it, and know that my logical brain will always come out on top. Safe in the knowledge that I am surrounded by Team Morris and some brilliant people and that’s my motivation in life.</p>

<p>We’ve all seen or heard of someone being ‘de platformed’ and loosing access to a service. Usually because they’ve done something stupid, or heinous and the powers that be no longer want them on their platform. It happens thousands of times a day, but it never fails to hit the news when someone popular gets the boot.</p>
<p>When this happens, there are always some people who don’t agree. Followers and fans unite to collectively shake their fists at the service for a time, but soon enough things return to normal. Sometimes people leave in protest, and flock to services better suited to them. Which is exactly what should happen. Not everyone deserves a place on the internet, but the question is should being able to publish to the internet be a right or a privilege?</p>
<p>Of course, these platforms are private companies. They can do as they wish and pull the plug on whoever and whenever they wish. Twitter is usually the last hold out, with <a href="/2021/03/19/was-this-correct.html">some serious thought put into</a> making the right decision for their platform but also for the larger conversation. Platforms should be accountable for what is <a href="/2021/01/04/the-law-that.html">hosted and posted on their service</a>, and suffer much less protection than they do in my opinion — but then to follow my logic where does it stop?</p>
<p>Of course there is no question when it comes to anything illegal. I’m referring to misinformation and what has commonly come to be known as “fake news”. Conspiracy theories that are miss informed at their core or intentional in their deception.</p>
<p>Are Amazon Web Services or Digital Ocean responsible for what’s on their servers when they have zero knowledge, and nor should they. There is no disagreement to not giving someone a platform to share abuse or hate, but I’m not sure where I come down on publishing to the web.</p>
<p>Everyone has a right to free speech and the internet should be no different. What they are not immune to is recourse and debate, which is a healthy part of human interaction. Should every belief, however weird or wonderful be allowed?</p>
<p>I am by no means an expert, and as with most things, this post is more of a public thought process that any kind of instruction. However, perhaps the answer is not removing the conversation entirely.</p>

<p>I am sure you all know my thoughts on tracking things. <a href="/2021/03/10/stop-tracking-random.html">I hate it</a>, unless it has a clear and transparent reason. The main point of the above post is to talk about being able to follow and consume whatever content you like, but this part stuck out to me.</p>
<p>Even just a few years ago the very idea of being tracked about what you do would be alien. No doubt it happened in some small instances, but by and large our lives where private.</p>
<p>Now we give up huge chunks of our private data either because we think <a href="/2020/08/18/your-privacy-is.html">it’s required</a>, or we do so willingly for the clout! There is nothing wrong with whatever data you choose to give up, that’s your choice, but how much of it is really needed and how much is collected just because it might be needed later. Kept in data centres we have no control over, just in case.</p>

This time feels more real, and I’ve worked out what I want to do with my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/social-media-in/">content going forwards</a>.</p><p>Those few times I have quit mean I completely understand the frustrations people have with the service. It has a considerable barrier to entry, but this is somewhat intentional and somewhat freeing. You have to give up some notions you have on blogging, and let some things be dictated for you. You also need to learn a few bits of code to mould the site to make it yours (mine is months in the making of learning CSS and Hugo).</p><p>I could wax lyrical about my change in thoughts about my blog, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/asking-giving-and/">my frustrations</a> with never achieving what I wanted, and now my more <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/what-is-your/">personal content creation</a>. I am sure micro.blog, <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> and the excellent community have helped me with this transition. The people that use mb can be <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/this-is-how/">more than a little preachy</a>, because of these barriers to entry does attract an overwhelming ‘type’ of user, but I have had overwhelmingly positive experiences with people that makes it all worth it.</p><p>Everything will still be <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/cross-posting-to/">cross posted everywhere</a> I can, and I still check in to Twitter a couple of times a day (I can’t quit it as it’s my social media addiction) so nothing much really changes. I wrote this as a kind of explainer to myself more than anything else, but now I have <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/whats-this-for/">worked out what this is for</a> I just hit post and forget about it. Perfect.</p>

<p>To steal some inspiration <a href="https://world.hey.com/gabz/something-i-liked-this-week-2635f110">from Gabz</a> I wanted to write about my favourite Apple device I own. For which I own loads of them — Apple Watch, iPhone 12 Pro, iPad Pro, iMac Pro, MacBook Pro (Pro all the things) — but these pale in comparison to my absolute favourite AirPods Pro.<br />
<br />
Since I purchased the original version within minutes of them going on sale, AirPods have been my go-to headphones for almost all situations. Before which I’d had a long stream of different ones and had to keep several around for different activities. I had Bose QC35 for music, Beats X for the gym and different headphones for running. Although I still put on some <a href="/2019/08/20/powerbeats-pro-review.html">Powerbeats Pro</a> for long-distance running, the newer Pro AirPods replaced everything else with ease.</p>
<p>What has further cemented their place in my heart has been the recent pandemic. They are invaluable for video calls, long telephone calls and catching me up with my <a href="/2020/10/18/podcasts-and-me.html">podcast feed</a> whilst walking the dog.</p>
<p>They are not perfect, but there are. It many things to improve. To mirror Gabz thoughts I love the physical buttons on the Powerbeats Pro, but it would be impossible to feature these in the small design. In fact, I would be hard pushed to think of any major improvements that would push me to upgrade to a new version. Even the battery life has been great for me, although that is bound to start to drop as they get older.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/a067433daf.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Sure the <a href="/2020/10/25/iphone-pro-thoughts.html">iPhone 12 is great</a>, I quite <a href="/2020/04/22/using-an-ipad.html">like my iPad</a> but is easy to pick my favourite device, and it’s also perhaps the cheapest one I have.</p>
<p>When Apple talk about the Apple Watch as their most personal device, I’d have to also put my AirPods Pro in that category. They are never very far away from me, and even fit in that weird small pocket in my jeans, so I always know where they are.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Yes. Unless you can’t tell I have moved my blog, <a href="/2021/01/28/i-didnt-want.html">again</a>. It’s now firmly rooted into micro.blog, and I’d like to say it’s made me happier. But you know me, I <a href="/2021/03/25/at-the-moment.html">worry</a> about almost everything at the minute and one of the biggest things I think abut is you!</p>
<p>Yep, you read that correctly. Readers. I can’t quite achieve where I want to get to with my micro.blog hosting, but I can get 90% of the way there. Links should be forwarded to the correct URL and the consumption of posts should be almost the same. The only thing I can’t fix is the RSS feed, it’s going to contain <a href="/2021/03/24/moved-all-of.html">all posts</a>, not just the important ones as before and of course I worry about that.</p>
<p>I want people to still follow me as before for whatever they want to read, but I am sure most people don’t want to have my random ramblings pushed to them all the time. I’ve sorted the main page to only contain important posts, but RSS subscribers might get a bit fed up.</p>
<p>When in reality I don’t owe anyone anything, and I really shouldn’t be bothered. I have never made any money out of this, and I am certain if people want to follow along they will find the <a href="/categories/main/feed.xml">correct feed in time</a>. Any new subscribers will be pointed toward this too, but little things like that always drive me nuts! Anyone know how to limit a Hugo RSS feed to a category? Because I can’t work it out!</p>
<p>Meanwhile I have ‘switched off’ the posts to the main feed in the hope I don’t annoy anyone. I’m sure I won’t, but if I do, let me know, and I’ll worry about it a bit more — or you can just put up with my ramblings.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In the middle of last year I was debating my surrounding technology, and 8 moths later I am still doing the same thing. Yet, this time, I <a href="https://gr36.com/my-set-up-and-want-for-more/">don’t want more from it</a>, I want less.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  My desire to make my set-up more is also contrasted to my need to make my computer more discreet. A more minimal approach to my office would make me much more comfortable, as well as win me some Instagram points! I don’t like a great big iMac stuck on my desk, so I am leaning more towards something like the LG Ultra Fine or an ultra-wide display which I could mount to a wall and also use with my Switch.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Whilst I want my set-up to deliver more, I want it to do so with as little intrusion as possible. Be flexible and work in many scenarios. Sounds like I am describing an iPad doesn’t it — sorry to disappoint. The iPad falls down at too many tools that I used to be an <a href="https://gr36.com/today-is-the-day-i-quit-the-ipad/">option any more</a>.</p>
<p>So, where to go, what to do? I have no idea. Since working from home, and ditching a few projects in my life, I have managed to slim down the amount of technology that I need around. Unfortunately, in contrast to this the time spent using a computer has increased tremendously due to working commitments that have taken over from personal projects.</p>
<p>There is something great about being able to just put a laptop away and its out of site, but WFH and needing a larger screen and a comfortable desk set up means this is also a no go. Thinking about the amount of room that technology takes up in my home, as well as my life is a scary thing. I want it to be less, but much like my desire to <a href="https://gr36.com/cant-go-back/">remove a smartphone</a>, it’s just never going to happen.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  At the same time, the internet is constantly disappearing. It’s a world of broken links and missing files—often because the people in charge cast things off on a whim. In 2019, MySpace lost 50 million music files and apologized for “the inconvenience.” Around the same time, Flickr started deleting photos at random. Even though many of Vine’s most unnerving or charming or “iconic” six-second videos have been preserved, its community was shattered when the platform was shut down.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of my big worries about where to publish to. I am always reluctant to get invested in somewhere that my content is because I just don’t want to loose it.</p>
<p>Tweets and random chat is nothing to be concerned about, but I have lost too much of my <a href="https://gr36.com/wheres-my-name-gone/">writing over the years to fools and their websites</a> to loose more to services shutting down or just misplacing it.</p>
<p>You can preserve site through the internet archive as much as you like, but it doesn’t get back the links and feelings that go with it. So making sure to preserve as many details about my digital life as possible is important to me, and one things I needed to make sure my writing app does. I have toyed with the idea of also backing this up in text documents with dates etc in them, but that just another long term project that I never get around too.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I question almost everything about my life. Constantly wondering about each and everything I do and many things that I come into contact with. It’s one of the best and worst things about my brain, and for the past few months I’ve been thinking a lot about what I do and what I enjoy. This has led me to important discoveries, like my love of gaming, but also some questions writing and publishing online.</p>
<p>You see, my blog doesn’t really have a thing. It’s not tech-based like it used to be. It’s not really about anything in particular, which I am not really fussed about. It’s a personal blog, people read the personal bits of and follow along if they want. What matters more is the publishing part, putting those words out there and not keeping them in my brain.</p>
<p>I figured a long time ago I didn’t need a ‘thing’. I’m not a brand, nor do I want to sell myself or anything that I produce. So the argument arises what exactly the websites, social media things and blog I have are for? With a certain level of <a href="https://gr36.com/where-does-this-go/">where does this go mixed in</a>?</p>
<p>So I am getting a bit stuck and where micro.blog fits in. At the minute it’s getting a bit left out because although I check in a few times a day I’m not really publishing anything to it like I used to. The photo challenge really made me appreciate where I post my things online but that seems to have fallen away again.</p>
<p>I am leaning more towards just cross posting everything into micro.blog and checking in for the social aspect. I’d like to get this to a stage where it is my only blog but I just can’t work the design or ability to a stage where I am happy with everything. Having <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/03/22/ulysses-with-microblog.html">Ulysses now publish to pretty much everywhere</a> after my <a href="https://gr36.com/looking-for-my-perfect-app/">exploration of writing apps</a> complicated things tremendously.</p>

<p>Feeling the need to defend Apple because another brand made an advert is a strange logic. Sure, the adverts are weird (no he’s not “just a normal guy”) but this really shouldn’t get the emotional response it has. A multi-trillion dollar company certainly does not need you to defend them. If anything the macBook speaks for itself in the market it is made for — which has very little cross over in the market this advert is aimed at.</p>
<p>Intel has been trying, and failing to become a brand in their own right for years. Remember the intel inside adverts? This new round of adverts are another attempt to do that, and <a href="https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/02.5-have-an-enemy">picking a fight</a> is the new way of doing business.</p>
<p>
[embed][youtube.com/watch](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rvDDC6ktCUg[/embed])
</p>
<p>The powers that be at Intel still want to be recognised as more than just the chip that’s stuffed into your laptop, and as other brands start to muscle in on their territory they need to lash out at a big company. Remember that no-one that buys a laptop at a lower price point than £1000 really gives a damn about new chips from Apple. They may see a macBook as an aspiration, but they don’t settle for an Intel laptop instead because they are compatible. They buy what they can afford, which is usually as cheep as possible, and be on their way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If anything their biggest comparison as connectivity improves are Chromebooks, but they can’t very well start lashing out at Samsung and Lenovo because they want to sell them chips for their other computers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, its logical that Intel would talk about Apple and at the same time big up all our business partners machines, it’s a win-win situation. Their chips will continue to be stuffed into the vast majority of computers sold and things will carry on as normal — like you should.</p>

<p>We know comparing MacBook to most laptops is Apple and Oranges, but who cares. It’s an advert…. Calm down.</p>

<p>For the past few days, I have been looking into the new notes app, Craft. It has been lauded up as the best app currently available, so understandably I wanted to take a proper look. I rage quite a couple of times previously because it was missing loads of things and wanted to charge £45 a year, but this time I went deep.</p>
<p>I posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1370683331562639361?s=20">long thread</a> about strange little bits that hadn’t been thought through properly. Including some weirdness with sharing vs exporting and poor implementation on Markdown. Perhaps the tendency to try to make it too powerful has lead to oversight in the ways it can actually be used. In an attempt to be more things to more people it feels more than a little lost.</p>
<p>It looks almost like an online Notion in places, and would allow me to store a lot of work related text files and PDF I have currently in folders easier, and allow them to be updated effortlessly. The exporting options in PDF and Word Doc look great and fulfils most of the things I often need to email to people — but I digress. The real root of this is thinking about UX rather than UI.</p>
<p>I can’t help but compare it to Notion in the fact that it too suffers from this slightly lost feeling. All the things have been thrown in, but thinking about actually using them takes more brain power than it actually should do. This is of course all my opinion. These things may have been thought about and decisions made that lean the other way from my usage. However, I am not alone in this feeling, reassured by several people on Twitter that they came to the same conclusion that leads me to believe that the UX need some serious attention.</p>

<p>The last sentence of Jacks <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510769268850690?s=20">first tweet</a> in his thread when following Trumps banning from Twitter has stuck with me. While the whole world can wax lyrical about the context and argue back and cowards about the correctness of the action. It’s this last sentence that the man in charge really shows the type of leader he is.</p>
<p>It’s an important step in anyone’s journey through life. Realising that in many situations your point of view could be affected by a range of different things. More so when you interact with people, supervise interaction between people, or in Jacks case are in-charge of one of the largest, and fast-paced social networks in the world. Unfortunately, not everyone reaches this realisation at the same point in life, if at all.</p>
<p>There is also an overwhelming tendency for CEO’s and ‘Silicone Valley Types’ to let their egos run sit front and centre of their personality and take the high road at every opportunity. So, when someone openly discusses their reasoning behind the decision and even questions themselves it proves a welcome breath of fresh air and has been something that has resonated with me.</p>
<p>Questioning even what would appear a pretty simple decision proves overwhelmingly that nothing is ever that simple. From everything from product managers, to parents it’s important to think about not only the decisions you make, but help others understand how you got there and be open for dialogue. You may think, or know you ar making the right decision but even the right choices can be interpreted differently by others.</p>
<p>There are an abundance of view points that it is impossible for anyone to consider, sure enough you don’t owe anyone an explanation at all. However, baring in mind how your decision can be perceived by others can mean to more understanding and more constructive feedback. It also might help you understand the designs you make more in-depth and lead to you being able to identify miss steps in your own though patterns early.</p>
<p>When you think about Jacker leadership of twitter, and the apparent lack of action over the platforms the biggest issues his response makes perfect sense. The lack of action could be put down to over thinking and miss steps in management. When in fact his thread shows the level of thought that goes behind decisions that can bring in gigantic changes to a platform hundreds of millions of people use.</p>

     <p>It doesn’t exist. You can’t find everything you want from an app, it’s like finding a unicorn. You’re going to have to compromise in some areas to get something you’re happy with. These are all things I have heard said, or have been said to me when I have been looking for the perfect app previously. It doesn’t matter if it is a todo app, calendar app, or note-taking companion — the perfect thing just doesn’t seem to exist. Doesn’t stop me from looking though!</p>
<p>I’ve been on a <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/03/searching-for-the-perfect-ios-markdown-writing-tool/">Jason Snell’esk</a> search for a writing app, or service that can do everything that I need it to do. I started by outlining exactly what I needed and the ways I would attempt to rank the ability for this to be fulfilled. I needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing app that was accessible and nice to write in. My eyesight is not what it was, so I sometimes like to boost the font size when in ‘focus mode’.</li>
<li>Able to take quick notes</li>
<li>Supports markdown. This can be either plain text or a modified version that hides some syntax, the important part is I can type it out because that’s just how my fingers work across a keyboard.</li>
<li>Able to export as a PDF and Word document. I use these lots for storing documents for work use, and sending these out for approval. Word is what my bosses prefer to use.</li>
<li>Works well across iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/a2a1e14704.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="bear-notes">Bear Notes</h2>
<p>This is an app <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-keep-coming/">I keep coming back to</a>. I tested the beta versions, and have been testing the upcoming new version extensively on both Mac and iOS. The ‘notes’ app is amazingly powerful, so much so I wouldn’t consider it a notes app at all as it can go toe to toe with much larger and expensive apps.</p>
<p>It looks great, incorporates the best iOS features such as shortcuts and widgets, and I can export all notes in a rage of formats including text bundle that I can <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/bear-notes-app/">publish straight to WordPress</a>.</p>
<p>However, I don’t love the tagging a system of organisation. I much prefer an inbox that I can sort and file things away. Where’s as by adding hashtags it gets some resemblance of order to it but still feels a little too chaotic with loads of notes.</p>
<p>The exporting also lacks any level of customisation, and some styling of these takes a bit of editing before I can send.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/78affa505e.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="craft">Craft</h2>
<p>The new hotness in iOS text apps nudges in here simply because of how powerful it is. Not an app I would usually consider due to its strange way of doing things (I talk about this more in my newsletter) and it’s expense.</p>
<p>With that said, Craft allows me to store almost every bit of text I could ever need from a simple note to writing a book if I ever needed too, all whilst looking brilliant and offering powerful export features.</p>
<p>A massive positive is the organisation Craft uses, based on folders and areas, works more like my brain does. Meaning I can have an inbox full of ideas, work on writing posts, store information for my day job and be able to edit and export to email effortlessly.</p>
<p>But… I just can’t get on board with some decision made with the app. Markdown is half-baked at best. For example, I cannot type in the image reference for an external image, it just disappears. Craft only support some Markdown syntax and not all of it, and there is also lots of UX weirdness I can’t wrap my head around.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f99ca5021d.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<h2 id="ulysses">Ulysses</h2>
<p>My favourite writing app for many years and one that I only recently stopped using because I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-didnt-want/">moved away from Ghost</a>. At the time I felt it was one of those apps I paid for simply because I always had, and it felt over engineered for my usage. Built more for real writers rather than bloggers.</p>
<p>It supports loads of iOS features such as shortcuts, allow me to store documents in folders and offers me a useful inbox. Ulysses is also fantastic at exporting in a range of different options and even allows for custom styling of them.</p>
<p>My only downfall really is that it doesn’t work very well as a note-taking app, or at least it doesn’t feel like it does. Starting can sometimes be a bit slow, so I would potentially have to use Apple notes for smaller things which is no hardship.</p>
<h2 id="back-home">Back Home</h2>
<p>Like some kind of cheating husband I have gone all around the houses only to realise the one <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1372593179501985794?s=20">I recently left is the best fit for me</a>. There are a few things I’d love to see improved but in terms of ticking away at all the points above Ulysses fits me like a glove. When throwing my hands up in the air and re-downloading it the first launch just felt like home. As much as all these flashy new apps come on the scene, or I just start looking for no good reason, the tried and tested option is quite often the best.</p>
<hr />
<p>Special mention to:</p>
<p>iA Writer — I love the interface, but I don’t really want to mess around with a folder full of files.</p>
<p>Byword — the same as above really, I used to love this app, but it feels left behind.</p>
<p>Apple notes — too much weirdness in pasting in information, particularly links. For some strange reason it still doesn’t support CMD+K on iOS.</p>
<p>I am sure there are plenty of others out there I didn’t try, please don’t tell me then, just let me live in blissful ignorance!</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Andy <a href="https://world.hey.com/andyn/the-sound-of-silence-5883fc39">on his avoidance of silence</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
I had a brief moment of silence today, only about a minute, but the feeling I had was so jarring, so alien to me, it actually felt like it would be interesting to write about. It probably made more sense at the time
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is something I have had on my mind for, <a href="/2019/04/29/skipping-silence.html">well years</a>. I think silence is an important part of life and communication. I value the time that is spent in silence and only break it when there is something important to break it.</p>
<p>I completely understand where Andy is coming from though. Many people find silence uncomfortable and something that will expend a significant amount of energy to avoid. I can’t comment on the reasons behind this side everyone, but previously it was because I felt uncomfortable with my own thoughts and wanted to be entertained constantly.</p>
<p>I didn’t really know myself and as such there were a lot of feelings and experiences I had had that I just didn’t want to risk thinking about. When it’s so easy to gain stimulation from external sources there is little reason to look into yourself at any point. Enjoying silence is one thing. It becoming comfortable in it is a life skill that everyone should learn early on.</p>
<p>I have been trying, and failing, to get my son into the habit of embracing boredom and silence in order to better himself. He’s 9 though so I don’t expect too much — but I really wish someone had explained these things to me at that age. Thinking and sitting with nothing particular to do needs work though, and work is hard!</p>
<blockquote><p>
Thinking, existentially speaking, is a solitary but not a lonely business; solitude is that human situation in which I keep myself company. Loneliness comes about … when I am one and without company’ but desire it and cannot find it. – Arendt
</p></blockquote>
<p>One you know this skill, practice it and become comfortable with it, you realise what a powerful tool it is to improve the times when you are not silent. You become more appreciative of the communication in your life and able to focus more than ever.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  It is worth noting that Apple’s app privacy labels are meant to show all the things that the app might access, not what information that app will access. For example, an app may only use location data when it needs to show you a map, but the privacy labels don’t make that clear — it’s just a binary used/not used. Also, the information in the labels is submitted by the company itself, and Apple doesn’t make promises about its accuracy.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems that the privacy labels that Apple show are more than a little bit fuzzy. Whilst it’s easy to start to point fingers, there are lots and lots of moving parts in anything to do with apps, income and huge businesses. It can’t be easy to implement these kinds of privacy options, but it seems they are not over looked by Apple.</p>
<p>Much like the permissions systems, there is a lot to communicate to the customer exactly why the app needs certain types of data. Whilst you want to display this clearly, you don’t want to put people off entirely for risk of loosing business.</p>
<p>I’m still <a href="https://gr36.com/apple-privacy-not-enough/">disappointed that these don’t go far enough</a>, but it least we are on the right track.</p>

I gain so much insight into the ways others use their devices from <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/9126-2/">these types of posts</a> so it’s only fair I do the same.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/ce15871515.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Very little <a href="https://gr36.com/homescreen-january-2021/">ever changes about my phone</a> but the <a href="https://gr36.com/favourite-ios-apps/">apps sometimes revolve around</a>. At different times of the year different apps become more important. So new ones appear on my single homescreen and some drop off.</p>
<p>The apps I need access to can be split into four basic categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio – Podcasts have become a lot less important since COVID due to no commuting. I still listen to the occasional show whilst walking in Pocketcasts, but I’ve been consuming more audio books lately. </li>
<li>Reading – I <a href="https://gr36.com/my-reading-flow/">love reading</a> and my iPhone is one of the devices I use most as it’s always on me. Instead of <a href="https://gr36.com/twitter-muscle-memory/">scrolling Twitter</a> I now open up <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/reeder-5/id1529445840">Reeder</a> or Pocket and catch up on things.</li>
<li>Photos – I like to keep the camera and gallery app near by, at least until the <a href="https://gr36.com/the-iphone-needs-a-camera-button/">iPhone gets a camera button</a>!</li>
<li>Writing – everything goes in <a href="https://gr36.com/back-to-bear/">Bear</a> now. I’m slowly migrating away from using <a href="https://gr36.com/my-writing-workflow/">Roam</a> after falling out of love with it and wanting to spend less on digital services. It’s a great platform but it’s getting a bit lost and no proper app doesn’t help. </li>
</ul>
<p>I also have micro.blog as my main social media fix. I also find a lot to read here, as well as awesome photos. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wavelength-for-micro-blog/id1365158696">Wavelength</a> is something I am thinking of using to start a small podcast.</p>
<h2>Widgets</h2>
<p>I mainly use Reminders to store things I need to do. However I am looking at bringing back something more robust for projects — hence Todoist and Things installed currently.</p>
<p>The larger Headspace widget helps me remember to use it more often. I love meditation and it’s part of my <a href="https://gr36.com/2020-review/">2021 improvements</a> to do it more often. The rest are self explainatory, <a href="/categories/shortcuts/">Shortcuts</a> are always around here somewhere.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  There’s this mindset among many people online that I like to call app lust. It means this desire to try out the next great app because people think it’ll be the answer to their problems but in reality just serves as a distraction that gives the person a hit of dopamine. Each new app satisfies this craving, and they’re always on the lookout for the next hit. I used to be this way, and I’ve learned that I’m happier when I rely less on technology and on apps.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been thinking <a href="/2019/07/29/a-new-productivity.html">about this for a long time</a>. Gabs <a href="/2021/03/09/no-replacement-for.html">touched on it</a> a few days ago, but Mario has put it perfectly. The level of consumerism and marketing tricks being used to sell apps and services is growing over time. They all promise to fix that gap in your work life, just like adverts promise to fix the one in your love life, or improve your happiness, or whatever it is. It’s all lies.</p>
<p>You see the same YouTubers and podcasters just <em>happen</em> to be talking about the same app at the same time. Flooding the market with overwhelming praise for this new thing that’s just the price of a coffee each month and will make you do sooooo much more work.</p>
<p>Spending time moving to a new service just because someone said so is costing you time and money. Stop it. You’re just craving the same dopamine hit consumerism sells you.</p>
<p>There is no answer to your problems unless you’ve used your current method to exhaustion or sorted your system out. Perhaps your current <a href="/2021/03/10/when-are-you.html">one is enough</a>?</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Every single advert you see on Tv has a pretty simple message. It wants you to be motivated enough to buy the stuff it is selling. They do this in a myriad of different ways, approach each one with a different angle or perhaps a different message, but the overall message delivered is ~you~ are not good enough without this thing.</p>
<p>Your body isn’t good enough, your hair, your clothes, the car you drive, even the food you eat. Nothing that you are currently doing, or anything about your own self, is good enough compared to this thing. Just look at how happy these people are, having loads of fun and smiling all the time. Don’t you want to smile too?</p>
<p>When you buy this thing, and only this thing we are selling, you will instantly feel better about yourself. You’ll be more attractive, look better and the sun will always shine. Of course when you do buy extra stuff you do feel good, at first. However it soon wears off and you will return to your normal state, and now feel bad for spending money and achieving nothing. So if buying this didn’t work, what <strong>is</strong> the answer?</p>
<p>It’s getting something else of course. Now you’ve got this thing, here’s another thing to buy, and perhaps you will feel happy with that one instead. Around and around it goes, accumulating stuff, because you’re not enough, spending money you don’t have because banks will lead you money to help you have enough. All in search of something you are told you’ve lost.</p>
<p>At what point <strong>are</strong> you enough? Where is your breaking point on this cycle of hate? Many people get all of these things and only <em>then</em> realise that they don’t make any difference. A truth we know right at the start.</p>
<p>You are enough already, you have enough to make you happy — and even if you don’t, accumulating stuff isn’t the answer.</p>
<p>You’re the answer. You’re enough. You’re awesome.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Tracking pixels can report the times and dates their associated email was opened, as well as the location of the device used, and the email client involved. That’s a lot of data to feed back to a third-party that you might not know much about.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I knew these kind of things existed, but until I <a href="https://gr36.com/favourite-hey-features/">started using Hey</a> I never understood what an epidemic this is. Understanding your marketing data is absolutely essential, I have skin in that game. Analytics of mass emails is absolutely essential to filling your customers needs — but the current levels of usage is frankly ridiculous.</p>
<p>Why on earth do you need to track your newsletter? Yes I see you, attempting to see when I open and on what device for absolutely no reason other than your ego. Stop joining in with the attention economy to satisfy your own need for validation. I’ve subscribed, I read it, it’s great. Isn’t that enough?</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I kept control of <a href="https://gr36.com/greg-thinks-things-future/">my own emails</a> because services like Substack either don’t, or certainly don’t appear to, allow you to turn tracking off. Reporting back to a third party what <em>your</em> email subscribers are doing is doing yourself a disservice and letting your readers down. Tracking marketing and needing to see some return for your investment is one thing, but letting <em>someone else</em> collect data that you have no control over is another.</p>
<p>Hopefully we see the same attention to data collection we have seen in browsers extend to more email clients going forward.</p>

     <p>You may have noticed my absence from almost absolutely everything over the weekend. No blogging, no posting, and very little social media updates other than a few <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17884476947085317/">Instagram stories</a> celebrating each mini victory. Thats because I had a weekend filled with pain and very little sleep running 48 miles over two days.</p><p>I ran four miles, every four hours, for 48 hours and it was the most challenging thing I have ever done. I learnt a lot about myself and what I can actually do, all thanks to deciding to do something nuts to <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/gr36">raise money for charity</a>. It has pushed me to awfully close to the limits in pain endurance, sleep deprivation and sheer mental toughness and I have to say I enjoyed it!</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/e0fca394cd.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>Looking back at the fitness stats it looks insane! I reached 640% of my move goal (600) on Saturday and more than 400% on Sunday also. Burning around 7,800 calories in three days is just mind blowing for me to think about. Sure, a long bike ride can equal it but combined with the stopping and starting every 4 hours meant it felt much worse than even running a marathon. I took in very little as my stomach just wouldn’t tolerate much, so I think I’ve dropped quite a bit of weight too! But enough about me.</p><p>Thank you to all of those that donated to <a href="https://newlifecharity.co.uk">Newlife Charity</a>, this is one very close to my heart and one that has helped me out tremendously when no one else would. The thoughts of the children and families they help kept me going during the dark moments. Particularly those in the middle of the night, when every finer of my body is screaming at me to stop running. I was able to focus on getting through each run at a time knowing the money would be used to help people that are not as lucky as me, and desperately need support.</p><p>But this isn’t a sales pitch, it’s not a plea for more money, not a grab for attention. It is a thank you, those that have supported me through this, sent me message and congratulated me on the completion means a lot to me. When times are tough, I know people can pull together and offer support in whatever way they can.</p><p>Once again thank you to those that donated. I am resting up and recovering well.</p>

<p>For the longest time I have been a huge supporter of keeping iOS locked down as tight as possible. Not budging a single inch, because that is what is best for the consumer, and I shudder a little when I think about a future with Android style ‘openness’ on my iPhone.</p>
<p>Sure, Android provides much more customisation than iOS. It allows you to do a lot more things. Not absolutely anything you want, but not far off it. But it’s a long time since I desired anything like that from my phone, and much prefer the tap square get app way that iOS works — that’s just me. I would still <a href="https://gr36.com/ill-gladly-pay-extra-for-apple-to-manage-my-payments/">gladly pay more for Apple to manage all my payments</a>, and if truth be told I trust them much more than any other brand. I’m <a href="https://gr36.com/not-being-a-fan-boy-is-hard/">no fan boy</a>, but when it comes to putting all my information on a bit of technology, I just trust them more and have confidence in the decisions they make to keep my information on my phone.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Apple App Store is so full of scammers and so lousy at search that if Apple ever did allow third party stores it is certain that a properly curated third party store would be much safer for users. So Apple arguing that the App Store makes users safer is utterly bogus.</p>
<p>— Peter N Lewis (@peternlewis) <a href="https://twitter.com/peternlewis/status/1356060405919956996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With all these things said. This trust I have in my fruity overlord is slipping, very quickly, and stories like the above keep popping up. I don’t ever think Apple will give up control of their platform, and nor should they, but they need to seriously step their game up to prove Apple’s arguments correct. Keeping control needs to be better for customers and as it currently stands, <em>it is</em> but not by a lot.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I know what most people think straight away. How many of todays posts are going to be about Apple watches? It was my first thought, because I do love my watch, but something more important watch related currently.</p>
<p>The world is in lockdown and we are all running out of stuff to watch. I feel like I have consumed the entire catalogue of Netflix series that are any good, and a few that were terrible but it couldn’t stop watching them (has anyone watched <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80178724">Living With Yourself?</a>) just for something to do. Currently we are rewatching Sons Of Anarchy, and I’d forgotten most of what happens so some of it is new to me and after then we are a bit stuck.</p>
<p>Amazon Prime has some ok shows, but isn’t packed full of top notch series. American Gods is pretty, but very slow going considering the book is one of my all time favourites. So my question is — what you watching?</p>
<p>TV series and playing games have been really useful for me during lockdown to unwind and a few shows to keep me going would be great!</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I often wonder why I publish things to the internet. It doesn’t matter if it’s a tweet, a photo or a full-on blog post, the whole idea of it seems futile when you really think about things. I don’t show ads, I don’t have a Patreon, I don’t make any money at all, so what <em>is</em> the point.</p>
<p>Yet there is one. Take for example the <a href="/categories/how-to/">‘How To”</a> guides that I write. They get next to no views in the grand scheme of my posts, but they inform some people so it’s worthwhile writing. I once get a nice email form someone stuck with their Lumia 950, and they found my how to guide (which is long gone) and manage to fix their issue when nothing else did.</p>
<p>To be honest most of these guides I write for myself because I need to refer to them later when I enviably forget how I did something. Yet informing that one person of what to do, makes all the hassle worthwhile.</p>
<p>The same goes for writing about the ideas and thoughts that I have, most of the time they slip by people without being read. Yet sometimes, just occasionally, I get a nice tweet or some feedback to say that’s for writing this because I feel the same but didn’t know how to express it.</p>
<p>So, writing to inform people is not what I do. My days of writing 3-5 news articles a day on tech news are long gone. Yet my blogging does get through to some people, and even if they don’t I love doing it. My blog is a bit like a digital journal that I often look back on, and I can feel the emotions I had when writing them. Some tell me things will get better, some tell me to never go back to that place, but they tell me something and that’s its own reward.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It was by absolute chance that I remembered to post today’s blog post for the March blogging challenge. Even on the second day I almost didn’t make it to write out something, maybe I need to build this <a href="https://gr36.com/a-creature-of-habit/">into a routine</a>!</p>
<p>By pure luck I checked my RSS reader of choice (<a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> is the best) and I had at some point subscribed to the prompt feed. So, as luck would have it, the gods of chance were on my side. Otherwise I would have completely forgotten, as I did for the first week of the <a href="https://micro.welltempered.net/2021/01/30/february-photoblogging-challenge.html">February photo</a> posts!</p>
<p>I am not usually a lucky person, I’ve never won a lottery, nor any prizes I think ever. I often question what I did in a former life to be blessed with such lack of luck, but I have two beautiful kids and a nice house so I guess if life <em>is</em> a game of chance I am doing pretty well out of it. I could never consider myself completely unlucky, but in things that rely on a chance, the ball never falls in my court.</p>
<p>So today’s post is a little smaller than I would have liked because it is rushed between doing so many things. I won’t leave the other ones to chance and try and set up something to remind me earlier in the day.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I wouldn’t say that daily routines are essential to me, but they are very highly ranked. I am a big creature of habit, and love to do the same things at pretty much the same time every day if possible. Working from home has only highlighted this further, and although it’s pretty weird to some people I have always loved to be in a routine.</p>
<p>Simple things like walking the dog in the morning completely throw me off if I can’t do them. This past period of self-isolation was brutal for that reason. I couldn’t do the things that I usually did, so I hated every second of it. Even right down to wearing similar things and eating similar dishes keeps me feeling in control of even a small portion of my day.</p>
<p>My morning consists almost entirely of routine-based planning, and Monday specifically needs to run like clockwork. After walking the dog, I make some coffee and sit down at my desk to start work. I have daily and weekly routines <a href="https://gr36.com/todoist-organise-my-life/">set up in Todoist to catch up on</a> what needs to be done and plan the rest of my week. Once this is done, I must catch up with my team, and then the day can begin!</p>
<p>I think I need to keep these little routines because my day can then descend into chaos some days, with hospital appointments, a seemingly <a href="https://gr36.com/5370-2/">endless run of bad luck</a> and loads to do at work, it’s important to keep some normality and my routines help me do this. Perhaps this is one of the reasons I love these daily challenge things so much, it keeps me in a routine for writing, or posting photos that I can keep track of and hopefully build up some good habits.</p>

     <p>When you first start out writing anything it’s daunting. It feels like it’s one of those things that anyone can do, but instantly feels like it’s something <em>you</em> can’t do very well. The reasons it feels like that is a complicated thing to work out but there are millions of people ready to tell you you’re wrong —- and that doesn’t help.</p><p>There are courses all over the internet to teach you how, as well as loads people to pick faults in the way you do it. To tell you how they do, and why their opinion matters to you. Why you should listen to them, what keywords to use and the types of images you should use. You know the old phrase about opinions the fact everyone’s got one. Well even more people have them about what you do with <em>your</em> blog.</p><p>Blogging can be very personal, and many people treat it as such. However, there’s no need to get bogged down in the minute details. Extraordinarily little resistance to getting your words out to people, and even less reasons to fret over what everyone else writes.</p><p>While you are worrying about everyone else’s opinions on the correct way to do things, you’re not writing. While you’re casting aspersions on other people that do not do things what you consider is the correct way, you’re not writing either. There is enough room on the internet for everyone to publish, and not feel like they don’t fit. There is no way you should be writing, no perfect blogging for you to be doing, and no advise that needs giving.</p><p>Just write and publish however you want to. <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/sitting-in-the/">Sit in the chair</a> and do it.</p>

     <p>When I first started writing on the internet it was a weird time. I wasn’t the first to do it, but I did zero research and just decided that was what I wanted to do. Without any clue how to use WordPress, or any CMS of that matter, I would write HTML pages and link them all together. A static site of sorts, but one I was prepared to put loads of work in because I wanted to be a ‘writer’. I wanted to do all the things that the technology writers I looked up to did and access all those sweet gadgets in the process.</p><p>I agree that there is nothing wrong with having hopes and ambitions, a boy can dream as they say. Well, I was a fully grown adult at this time, but I still had a dream. I bounced around some tech news sites, publishing loads of articles, at some points 2-3 a day — all for free. I thought this was the way to make it to the big time. It was, but I was looking at it all wrong.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The great thing about blog posts—as opposed to things destined for print, or even tweets—is that when you spot a typo, you can quietly fix it, and most people are none the wiser. One can take comfort in that, even as everything else falls apart.</p>— Mαtt Thomαs (@mattthomas) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattthomas/status/1129587879515185153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2019</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>I desired a future where my words were read with the interest with which I consumed others. Poignant, and sought out by readers that valued what I had to say on the matter. I treated my blog as such, constantly fretting that it wasn’t good enough, the design didn’t live up to the modern web and worrying that I didn’t produce weight content. My blog needed to be what I wanted my future to look like, a digital version of “dress for the job you want”.</p><p>The trouble was I wasn’t particularly good at it. I didn’t have hot takes enough to drive a following and I couldn’t follow through on my desire to pump out content. So as my desire and drive faded, the thoughts towards my blog began to wane. What I wanted my blog to be changed, and although <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/asking-giving-and-blogging/">I tried to rekindle that romance last year</a>, it is now something made just for me. A reflection of myself.</p><p>It has errors, terrible old posts, and more than a few takes that turned out to be completely wrong – and that’s ok. My blog is me, I have an edit button, and a delete button, but it goes me something that nothing outside of blogging can give me. It is a digital extension of all the weird stuff that floats around in my brain. It’s <em>my</em> blog.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Direct payment tools have become increasingly important for creators in particular in recent years. Patreon has been hugely successful, and other platforms including Facebook, YouTube, and even GitHub have all launched direct creator payment features.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Growth growth growth. That’s the name of the game in big tech and there is no room for excuses. Instead of developing and building in what your platform offers, the current state of play is stuffing everything that is good about other platforms into your own.</p>
<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with, cough, borrowing features as long as you know what you are and where you’re going. What becomes apparent very quickly is when the borrowing becomes desperate and this seems like one of those times. Here’s Jacob on the second feature Twitter wants to implement.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Groups have been a huge success for Facebook (and a huge moderation problem, too), and they could be a particularly helpful tool on Twitter, since the service’s open-ended nature can make it difficult for new users to get started on the platform.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Whilst the getting paid for your tweets sounds understandable, if a little far fetched. If you needed any more proof that Twitter has no idea what actually makes Twitter different from others, it’s the choice to bring closed groups into an open platform.</p>
<p>Whilst Twitters issues are huge and never ending, and attempts to make it more community based could<br />
be a huge positive step. Groups are not the way to do it. This limits reach, closes open discussions down and separates Twitter into silos that go against its very nature. The constant, always on, and open nature of Twitter is what attracts its users to love it most. It feels more personal than curated posts on other platforms. Twitter doesn’t need to be more Facebook, particularly at a time like this.</p>
<p>Of course neither of these have launched yet, and there is no date for either of these things, so I’m reluctant to make any huge sweeping judgements, but all of the features that seem to come from Twitter just don’t seem like they come from Twitter.</p>
<p>Perhaps shareholders need to see some return and stuffing in features that work in other places is what they demand. Who knows, but they certainly don’t seem to know what Twitter is, or what it needs.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  One of the guiding principles of Hey, to me, seemed to be some simplicity and relaxing of email norms such as inbox zero and the like, so a blogging platform in an email service does, at first glance, seem a bit odd. It is, however, as I said a really interesting approach and idea and it’s something I’d definitely jump on trying if it does every become a shipping product.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hitting the nail here on the weird dichotomy of the new feature teased by Hey.</p>
<p>It’s both a completely stupid idea, but also one that is very interesting indeed. One of the things I enjoy about <a href="https://email.gr36.com/">my own newsletter</a> is because I write it like an email to all the subscribers and not a blog post like some do.</p>
<p>This new feature in Hey, <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1363956784600281088">not yet even announced for users</a>, will allow readers to subscribe to future posts in email or by RSS. Making it not really a blogging option, but instead a really interesting take on the newsletter boom and one I will definitely keep an eye on.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  It’s worth mentioning that any Australian publisher aggrieved by an unfair exchange of value with Google here could opt out of search results at any time by adding one line of HTML to their website. But almost none of them do because traffic from Google drives significant advertising and subscription revenue to them.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On the news that Facebook blocked all news in Australia after refusing to make a deal, it’s easy to blame the big blue F and move on. Calls for people to delete their accounts once again rung out on, well everywhere. But the fact of the matter is that while there are a huge number of reasons to ditch your account, this issue isn’t one of them.</p>
<p>The banning of news sharing was miss guided and stupid, but this Australian ruling threatens one of the most open principles of the web. The sharing of a hyperlink and it appearing on other websites.</p>
<p>Displaying text, and the huge boxes on Google searches aside. The sharing of links to other peoples content is the back bone of many a website. Where exactly does it end? Do I have to now pay The Verge for writing a link post?</p>
<p>The absurdity of these types of moves that keep big media companies in good stock will now continue around the globe. No doubt Facebook et al will make some stupid responses, but it’s far too easy to blame them for everything when in reality, as pointed out by Casey, this move is exactly the right one for all of us.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I posted <a href="/2021/02/18/i-find-it.html">this very tongue in cheek recently</a>. A brief thought that passed through my mind whilst walking my dog and listening to <a href="https://www.breakthetwitch.com/">Break The Twitch</a>. Weirdly the act of posting it made that thought stick around longer than it would have, and it is a useful thing to remember.</p>
<p>In my early teens I wanted to be a teacher, and only when I did some work experience and found out what it was actually like, were the rose-tinted glasses knocked from my eyes. It’s fair to say that I left University with not a clue what to do with the rest of my life, and worked retail for far too many years. From that day to this I have never even considered my job as my calling, but it is definitely something that I enjoy doing and will continue to do as long as possible.</p>
<p>I find it quite strange, but admirable, that people know exactly what they want to do for the rest of their life from a very early age. Discovering a passion without even looking and locking in their ambitions to their laser focus.</p>
<p>As the old saying goes “Do what you love, and you’ll never work another day in your life”. Of course, this presumes that the route to finding exactly what you love and making it your job is one that is straight forward and easy to navigate. You see, your passions take time to discover, and often need some effort to discover. As Stephanie O’Connell says, “You’re not born with it”.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Passion doesn’t arrive while waiting for inspiration to strike, it’s uncovered through action and work. Think of it like falling in love. You don’t just sit at home and decide you’re going to fall in love with a certain person, you go out and share different experiences with different people until you do. – <a href="https://stefanieoconnell.com/truths-pursuing-your-passion/">Stephanie O’Connell</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>There is also a big presumption in this saying that you <em>can</em> turn your passion into a job that supports you. That can be a pretty big ask from some pursuits, and presumes you have the skills to ‘sell it’. Hustle and grind are words we see banded around as if everyone can do anything with enough work, but what if you just don’t have the skills or the ability to do it.</p>
<p>There is something to be said about hard work and dedication, but of course ability needs an environment to be able to flourish. For every person that beats all the odds and lives the dream, there are millions grinding away and <a href="https://gr36.com/do-whatever-you-need/">doing what it is that they need to do</a>. Or simply cannot get to where they need to be to realise their passion.</p>
<p>In my mid-twenties I decided I wanted to write. In my mid-thirties I decided I wanted to learn to code and improve my design skills. Perhaps in my forties there might be something else and I still don’t consider myself anything like the grown ups my teachers told me I had to become. There is something quite freeing of admitting this to myself and I wish I knew this earlier in life.</p>
<p>I wonder how many people still don’t know what they want to be when they grow up. I just know what I am right now, and that’s ok.</p>

<p>Perhaps avoid is the wrong word, but we’ve all felt that annoyance that we opened the app to send a quick tweet and all of a sudden time has disappeared. There are a number of ways to avoid this and the <a href="https://gr36.com/twitter-muscle-memory/">Twitter muscle memory</a> that goes with it, but getting <a href="https://gr36.com/needing-feedback/">feedback from my blog posts</a> is still an important loop for me to fill.</p>
<p>So, the indieweb comes to the rescue and provides much of what I seek through webmentions. By using <a href="https://brid.gy/">Brid.gy</a> I can receive a webmention to my WordPress blog whenever someone likes or replies to my post. I can check these every so often, or set it up pretty easily to get an email if someone replies.</p>
<p>All of these responses poll through Bridgy every so often, and then if a link is found that accepts web mentions, it is forwarded to my WordPress Blog.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5283" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f1e73d7b6f.jpg" alt="" width="2572" height="542" /></p>
<p>After me approving them, likes and comments show up as native comments, with avatar and a link straight to the tweet.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5284" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8456ca5285.jpg" alt="" width="1732" height="1584" /></p>
<p>It is an elegant solution collecting feedback on your work, and not having to check and reply to things.</p>
<h2>Replying to a web mention</h2>
<p>If the reply or wingback is from a page that supports webmentions I can reply to it straight from my blogs comments section. For example, when my post appears on micro.blog and someone replies, I can click reply in the comments and it replies straight back to them on micro.blog as if I was using the website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nothing exists to the do the same on Twitter so if I need to reply I have to head over to Twitter. But I can got straight to the tweet with a click and reply easily.</p>
<p>This has helped to avoid these rabbit holes I disappeared down and made me a bit happier the times I did visit Twitter to scroll through.</p>

<p>  I’m going to use it a bit more than normal over the next week or so because it’s new and shiny. Maybe I’ll leave my iPad for good because of how good it is…but that’s not likely 😛
</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt does these posts every now and again that sum up why he’s done something. And at first glance this post seems like a bash the iPad post. But it does a great job of summing up the reasons for using a Mac – and I agree with all of them.</p>
<p>While the iPad can do a lot of great things, editing video is not one of them. Lumia fusion is ok, but missing so many things that both speed up workflow and make editing much easier. If you make an iPad app you must cater to touch input and that doesn’t work all the time, especially when you have complex features and menus 2&gt;3 levels deep.</p>
<p>I can see a world where iOS and Mac have a lot of cross over but distinctive traits that make them great at specific things. Theres still something holding the iPad back for some things and that’s ok. Let’s not squeeze things into holes they are not designed to fill, but embrace them because of what they are made for.</p>

     <p>After <a href="/2018/01/20/using-microblog-aka.html">trying</a> and <a href="/2019/12/15/bye-microblog.html">failing</a> several times, I am starting to move <a href="/2021/02/04/digital-social-distancing.html">further and further away</a> from Twitter. I still check in every once in a while, but a good long break is helping to stop my impulses and <a href="https://gr36.com/twitter-muscle-memory/">curb my impusive usage</a>.</p><p>I don’t hate Twitter, far from it, I love it, I just want it to do more than it does. It offers a platform that has barely moved forward for years, and just isn’t <a href="/2021/01/11/social-media-in.html">powerful enough for the modern web</a>. So I still cross post everything to Twitter and visit perhaps once or twice a day to check my mentions. I might even scroll through if I am feeling particularly interested and see what is going on, but in the main part I stay away a lot more than I did.</p><p>Which has gotten me thinking about where it fits in and the image I want to portray. I deleted my <a href="/2017/11/12/i-finally-deletedfacebook.html">Facebook account fully in 2017</a> after months of not using it because I didn’t want to appear like I was Ghosting people and this situation feels remarkably similar. I am sure people understand that a blog post is probably auto posted, but my micro.blog posts appears as if I have posted them myself and slow or no replies seem a bit rude.</p><p>One of the reasons I love <a href="">micro.blog</a> is because it is so slow. It is based around stopping, thinking, and writing a response properly. Taking a <a href="https://ljpuk.net/2021/02/11/take-a-breath-before-you-post/">breather before you tweet</a> is an important lesson, but one very rarely taken. So Twitter sometimes feels like a whole network built on “this is why you’re wrong” when in reality it is just the fast paced nature of the platform.</p><p>Twitters whole deal is instant, always on connection constantly being updated. So, slow replies don’t fit in here. I don’t want to appear rude, and I certainly don’t want to cut it off completely, but you may not get many replies from me anymore, and I hope that is ok.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>There are numerous things that I cannot remember when and why I started doing, I just do. But running I know exactly when and why. I was in my second year of secondary school, and we were doing cross country. I’d never been a highly active kid, but it was a nice day, and I couldn’t be bothered to walk it like the ‘cool’ kids did, so I ran.</p>
<p>Turns out I quite enjoyed it, and despite what half the school would tell you, it was lots of fun. Even more shocking to me was that I was actually rather good at it too. That was the day I started to run, and it improved that day tremendously. I went to my next class with a big smile on my face. To this day I’ve never stopped.</p>
<p>I ran at first because it made me feel good. I got faster and people started pushing me faster still. I started to run races, and win medals, and the pushing never stopped. Very quickly I became to hate running, because it was no longer enjoyable, it was a chore and one I had to do at set times, distances, and speeds.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I no longer run for gold anymore, but I still run. Most days I lace up my trainers and go out for a run, and the benefits to me are huge. Getting my blood pumping, clearing my lungs and my mind and making me feel so much better. I don’t focus on running every fast, and don’t set out to even cover certain distances I just go out and see what happens. Despite <a href="https://gr36.com/injured-best-thing-health/">discovering cycling last summer</a>, nothing has ever replaced the feeling I get from running. It has become part of me, just something I do.</p>
<p>People do ask, but I never have to ask myself why I run. The answer is because I love it.</p>

  The crux of having other significant others (as coined by psychologist Eli Finkel) is to have your needs met from more than just your romantic partner. Your partner cannot always meet all your needs even if you expect them to. So, these are the people who would go along with you to exercise or listen to you vent about things your partner isn’t interested in hearing.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is some of my issue and why I keep a lot of things to myself. I do not want to burden my wife with my problems, but have no real significant others the share things with.</p>
<p>There are people that <a href="https://gr36.com/reaching-out/">reach out</a>, and I am very grateful for this. But how personal do you get with people before feeling embarrassed? Looking back I’m not sure I’ve ever had friends close enough to share my frustrations and worries with. That’s pretty weird isn’t it?</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When Apple announced the requirement for apps to be transparent about their privacy implications, I nodded in agreement and never gave it a further thought. Of course they should let users know what is being tracked and the information being used. In fact, the surprising part is that it’s taken until now for something so obviously Apple to be introduced.</p>
<p>It is one of those “of course they should do that” moments for people that follow along with Apple, but will it actually mean a lot to the end user? This is a hard question to answer. While average users are definitely becoming more aware of the issues surrounding some companies, look at the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/whatsapp-flap-shows-importance-of-message-platform-to-facebook/articleshow/80874101.cms">uproar directed towards a fairly mundane policy update</a> for WhatsApp. Users are still using Facebook in their billions despite all of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">issues</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-civic-groups-internal-docs-capitol-riot-misinformation-hate-2021-2?r=US&amp;IR=T">surrounding</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">them</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444205/mark-in-the-middle">during</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/20/21375381/facebook-qanon-purge-content-policy-tide-pods">the last</a> few years.</p>
<p>So, silly me, was expecting a clear and concise sum up of the app you are looking to download. For it to be displayed clearly. Allowing the user to know exactly what they are going to install on their phone.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/dcfccef7e5.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>What we actually got feels like a token gesture to use as a signal to their customers they are fighting for you. Yet it is buried away at the bottom of the listing, underneath the rest of the information that no body reads. They might as well have put it in the terms and conditions of their devices because it stands about as much chance of being read.</p>
<p>This half step, which took an age to make, is frankly pretty pointless. I struggle to understand why the big companies kicked off so much in the first place. Most of them have been allowed to get away with pretty much whatever they like anyway. Remember Facebook <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/the-background-data-and-battery-usage-of-facebooks-ios-app/">playing silent audio</a> because of a ‘bug’? Or using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/">enterprise certificates</a> to get more data on users, with very little recourse. Remember <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16343304/uber-location-tracking-opt-out-apple-ios11">Uber tracking the hell</a> out of pretty much every iOS user? Apple clearly needed to make a change, but this pathetic attempt is more PR than a privacy upgrade.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am missing something, perhaps there is more going on behind closed doors and we are getting a privacy upgrade, but these labels will make pretty much zero difference, and I can’t understand why it stopped <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/12/google-youtube-iphone-update/">Google updating it’s apps</a> at all.</p>

  Facebook states that choosing between tracking users for personalized ads and protecting their privacy is a “false-trade off,” claiming that it believes it can provide both.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Why are you not providing it then 🤦‍♂️.</p>
<p>This par spin Facebook puts on its actions and the attempts to curb its control are getting laughable. We all know what Facebook is like, we all know their company is run by some one letting his ego run a mock, yet they try and spin the story every time.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg has a tendency to lash out when provoked so it will be interesting to see what happens. I can’t think of much they can do to harm Apple though?</p>

     <p>After reading some other bloggers writing workflows and even looking at some diagrams to illustrate them that I realised how simple my own is.

<p>In fact just looking at the graphic on <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/02/01/our-secret-optimizing.html">Numeric Citizens</a> post makes me stare in amazement. I cont even keep up with having more than one notes app, never mind about publishing to more than one or two websites. I take my hat off to him, but I love having one avenue to worry about my words going to and then in syndicate everywhere.</p>
<p>I am interested in what goes where and why, as if anyone has a method to this madness it’s JFM.</p>

     <p>I’ve kept reasonably quiet about Stadia, and it’s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-02-01-google-shutting-down-internal-stadia-studios-offering-streaming-tech-to-publishers">predicted demise</a>. Partly because I can’t be doing with the hassle and moaning, and partly because I am not that motivated that I want to argue the case for a huge corporation. However, since I first started playing on it a couple of months ago it has been a revelation.</p><p>It started out as a way of me feeling in with the crowd <a href="https://gr36.com/non-gamers-guide-google-stadia/">and playing Cyberpunk 2077</a> but has become a valuable way of my unwinding and catching up on all the gaming I have missed out on for the past few years. I’ve had a Switch on and off since launch but never got as in depth into playing as I am now. For some reason being able to pick up my controller and play on my phone, iPad, or on my TV whatever the situation really fits into my life.</p><p>I get next-gen graphics for a fraction of the price, and I’m loving almost everything about it. There are a few stutters sometimes, and not all the games I want to play are on it (hurry up FIFA 21) but the downsides are compromises I am willing to make. There are more and more games launching all the time, and my only criticism is related to all digital games — they are overly expensive!</p><p>Like I said, this isn’t an argument for Stadia, I have no strong feelings either way. You might have other views about it, that’s cool too. This is just my thoughts on me being able to play something that fits into my life. My enjoyment of playing has increased and instead of spending money on tech I seem to be bankrupting myself buying games!</p><p>If it goes away, I will be sad, but I’m not about to argue with you why you think it sucks. You do you, I’ll carry on playing Stadia. 🎮</p>

     <p>Last night, just before heading up to bed I published a blog post. Not an exceptionally long one, but something that <a href="/2021/02/10/reaching-out.html">I wanted to share</a> and hopefully inspire others. Rushing it out, hitting publish just before I turned everything off for the night.</p><p>Despite settling down and reading my kind for a while and enjoying a peaceful house my brain started to wonder what feedback I had gained on my post. But you know it’s getting late, dark outside and I am quite enjoying this <a href="https://micro.blog/books/0316457426?title=The+Coast-to-Coast+Murders&author=James+Patterson&isbn=0316457426">James Patterson book</a> so I try and put it out of my mind. It’s still there though, the need to check what’s going on. This is a feeling I have been paying attention to recently due to my years of ingrained <a href="/2021/02/05/twitter-muscle-memory.html">Twitter muscle memory</a>.</p><p>It’s more than a fear of missing out and seems to run deeper into my brain than I care to admit. Soon becoming apparent that I can’t shake this itch in my brain and need to see what’s going on. So I put my Kindle down, pick up my phone and bounce around on Twitter and micro.blog annoyed at myself.</p><p>Of course nothing is happening other than a couple of likes, but even if there was I shouldn’t be reading it at this time of night anyway. My need for feedback is now messing up my sleep pattern as well as beginning to stress me out. It seems I am surprisingly good at giving out advice to others, but not very good at keeping it myself. When it comes to social media, it’s got me right where it wants me. Not only am I checking it every bored moment, but I am also checking it for feedback.</p><p>I wouldn’t say that I was doing it to inflate my ego, this wasn’t that kind of posts, but I wanted to see if others thought the same. To see if I could provoke others to do something kind, so I’ve already got a kind of excuse sorted in my mind. The fact remains that social media is taking a much larger role in my current life and I don’t like it!</p>

  The problem with insular bubbles isn’t just that you’re surrounded by people that share the same world view. It’s also terribly problematic that every time an opposing viewpoint pokes through, it’s re-told and framed through the lens of someone that already disagrees with it.<br />
  You can’t expect to understand the argument unless you actually listen to someone that believes it whole-heartedly.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not sure what provoked Mike’s post, but it could be about any number of things in recent times. Living in a bubble feels amazingly great, you’re rewarded for feeling the same as everyone else and protected by people that feel the same as you. It’s <a href="https://gr36.com/addicted-to-conspiracy-theories/">simple biology that may be hardwired</a> to enable us to find safe communities.</p>
<p>As pointed out above, this is dangerous for balanced thought and just general understanding of other people. Building a tolerance to other threads of thought is impossible to achieve when you are not even interested in the other side of the coin.</p>
<p>But why should we? AI and algorithms understand us better than other people, so we are quite contented living in our little bubble and have content surfaced for us to hit that little dopamine bubble. When someone crosses our path that has different beliefs than our own, why should we tolerate it?</p>

     <p>It was so nice today to receive a text out the blue just asking if I was ok. It isn’t something I get very often, if at all, but to come from someone I ‘met on the web’ it meant so much more. With my wife suffering from COVID, one child to home school and another that needs constant care, as well as working full time from home, the pressures are starting to show.</p><p>I don’t have many ‘real’ friends as my wife would put it, because to be honest I don’t really have much spare time, and even less for the last year. However, I have met some really awesome people through social media, and specifically Twitter that I am happy to now call friends.</p><p>It made me think about reaching out to others more often. I’ve done it myself just recently and I really hope it has had the same effect on them, that the message I received today had on me. For something so small, it meant so much and gave me a real boost today as things get tough around here. Social media can often display a life that is nothing like the one actually being experienced, and mental health issues can strike anyone, at any time.</p><p>My renewed motivation has led me to setting a reminder for me to reach out to someone new each week and just catch up with them. I am hoping this small gesture will make sure we are all getting through the bad times and are able to reach the good times. I urge you all to do the same, reach out to a loved one, friend, colleague or neighbour and just check in. A brief message just saying you are thinking of them can mean the world in challenging times.</p>

<p>I had no idea what on earth cottage core was when I clicked on this. Turns out it’s yet another way for people to get attention online.</p>
<p>But this statement really stuck out to me. Classifying yourself as something seems to be so important to people, and even fleeting trends on social media seem to need a name.</p>
<p>This label thing seems to be huge in tech. “I’m and Apple guy”. “I’m a manga nerd”. “You’re an Android user”. The need to exist in a group runs deep into our core (see what I did there) and we cling to labels in almost everything we do.</p>
<p>When thinking about who you are, it’s important to know these things and recognise their importance in your life — but don’t make labels important to your existence.</p>

Annoyed that although a few people contributed, it didn’t do anywhere near the level that I expected and really knocked my confidence.</p><p>Truth is, I have been trying for a while to make writing and blogging pay like it used to. 6-7 years ago web ads paid ok with a few thousand hits a month and didn’t completely wreck your website and income paid for my hosting and even allowed me to, shock horror, make a little profit.</p><p>The web is much different now than even that brief time ago. The level of content available online for free is ridiculously high. With little searching you can find software, services, videos, and even news coverage for free. At least in the sense that it appears to be free, admittedly some apps, service etc do show ads. Which makes it much harder, without a very dedicated audience to charge for anything.</p><p>So what’s the solution — if there even is an issue at all? I asked, I gave many hours to the cause and like many of us, hit a wall. I could stop doing what I am doing, which isn’t likely (I talked about this in a recent edition of my newsletter) given my very low bar of what success looks like. But it would be easy for me to do so. I feel that jealous rage when someone does things better than me that we all do at some points. It’s dead easy to just throw in the towel and admit defeat.</p><p>It’s not defeat though. It’s the same result that thousands of bloggers feel. Those that make typos like I do, rush like I do, and write about things that have a huge talent pool. The elite group is a tiny little percentage that start out, especially in tech, and I don’t even want to <em>have</em> to write about tech all day every day anyway. It would just kill off my love of anything!</p><p>I asked, I’m giving, and I am still blogging — now more than ever.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I am not going to lie, 2020 was tough — as it was for loads of people, some more so than me. The pandemic hit at a time I was finally moving towards the goals I have worked for for a long time. Then <a href="/2021/02/04/124258.html">this happened</a>, that happened, blah blah blah woe is me right.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>I’m looking up. And forward to the time that things will be easier, quieter and a whole lot more social. There will be a time when I don’t have to <a href="/2020/08/20/missing-a-good.html">miss people as much as I do</a>. I don’t have to worry after every cough that I’ve caught something, and a time when I can do things on days off. However, I absolutely refuse to go back to the way things were and I hope you are too.</p>
<blockquote><p>Choosing to Return to the way things were is like choosing not to adopt software a decade or two ago. It’s an option, but one that will doom a company to mediocrity. (Packy McCormick, <a href="https://notboring.substack.com/p/were-never-going-back">We’re Never Going Back</a></p></blockquote>
<p>We are not The nEw NoRmaL but the hope I look up to is that we become something different than before. That I become something different. Working, Social and everything in-between is improved to a point where it improves lives and we are more community orientated. We look out for each other and build a community around it that cares for us in our times of need and is built of real relationships.</p>
<p>Not likes, not retweets, not clicks not views. Nothing that can be measurable and compatible. Something that is a lot more real, almost tangible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have no idea what that is, but I don’t trust the <a href="https://gr36.com/social-media-2021/">current crop of web platforms</a> to care about anything other than metrics and growth. We are the ones that need to c<a href="/2021/01/11/social-media-in.html">are about each other more</a>. We are the users that provide platforms with content and drive the growth they crave. The ones that hold the power to change our own communities for the good.</p>
<p>We can’t rely on anyone but ourselves to look forward, look around and change the things we are not happy with. It could be working conditions in our company, it could be needing more support from friends, it could be focusing yourself in different areas. It doesn’t matter what it is, look forward.</p>
<p>We simply don’t deserve to just slip back to the way thing were.</p>

  Sometimes we can get so caught in our ways of thinking, we become blind to what is right in front of us. One way around that is to adopt the opposite idea for a while. This could be a big idea (like a world view) or something small (like “wide angle lenses are the best for street photography”).</p>
<p>  When you adopt the opposite view, you may confirm your traditional belief or approach. But you may also notice something different, something unexpected. Sometimes it’s a small thing (isolating a subject can lead to great effects in street photography) and sometimes its revolutionary.

<p>Dare I admit this, but I have a habit of, as my Grandad would say, <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cant-see-the-wood-for-the-trees">not seeing the wood for the trees</a>. I often get bogged down in minute details that are incorrect but miss the larger meaning or intent of the opposing view.</p>
<p>In my defense some of my closest friends, including my wife, often have opposing view points I enjoy nothing more than trying to see where they are coming from and use this to better my own understanding. However, it’s always good to be reminded of our ability to adopt the other position, because sit quite often leads to great results.</p>

     <p>Whenever an idea hits me, or I just want to ‘say’ something to the internet I press the little blue box with the bird on it. That is just what I’ve <em>always</em> done, well for the last 12 years anyway, and that habit is proving almost impossible to break. If thoughts arise, they are flung onto the internet in the quickest possible time!</p>
<p>This isn’t restricted to the mobile app either. In fact, I haven’t had it installed for weeks, but I can open Safari, and be browsing through Twitter before I even register what is going on. Every spare moment when I could be bored, my hand instinctively reaches for my phone. I don’t even think it has anything to do with the service, it is simply a behavioral habit that is almost impossible for me to break. The muscle memory of years of usage is so powerful that I can’t switch it off without expending <em>a lot</em> of energy.</p>
<img src="uploads/2024/6e75110cba.jpg" />
<p>There are two options really, I could start jumping up and down, blaming Twitter and cursing designers. Without a doubt that does play a part, but as I have talked about before I don’t <a href="/2020/09/09/itxs-not-the.html">blame the internet for my issues</a>, I lay them at my feet. My other option, the path I am choosing, is to recognize these traits and slowly break them without giving myself a bad time. Where I would usually feel down, buy a smaller phone or some other radical move, I do something else or write a blog post just like this one!</p>
<p>I do want my <a href="/2020/09/01/the-trickle-down.html">attention back</a> from these types of actions, I don’t want behaviors like this to be so ingrained I can’t help it. However, the muscle memory runs so deep I may never be able to fix it completely. There is nothing wrong with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_time">dead time</a> if used correctly and being busy helps quite a bit. As I have learned, there is no one more hash on me than myself, but things like this drive me more than a little mad.</p>

  It involves the use of simple, well-bounded scenes of flat cartoon figures in action, often with a slight distortion in proportions (the most common of which being long, bendy arms) to signal that a company is fun and creative. Corporate Memphis is inoffensive and easy to pull off, and while its roots remain in tech marketing and user interface design, the trend has started to consume the visual world at large. It’s also drawing intense criticisms from those within the design world.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I quite enjoy it when opinionated designers loose their cool. It makes them seem more human and not on the pedestal they often put themselves on. But on this occasion I do somewhat understand the annoyance, but they fail to communicate it very well.</p>
<p>Dubbed Corporate Memphis, we’ve see this coming for a long time. Todoist <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/178">introduced the tiny heads illustrations</a> that seemed to leak into every other app and now the same style is everywhere. Brands are loosing their uniqueness out of laziness more than anything.</p>
<p>There is a high level of pattern matching going on, but that doesn’t mean you can’t turn this style to display your brand. As someone that uses this style a little it has made some of our more information dense work more approachable by displaying images that customer are used to seeing, and I am certainly not put off using it because other designers get a bit snooty about it.</p>
<p>Using this style indeed makes the barrier to entry of designing something professional much smaller, and as with photographers, that tends to hurt creatives a little. Yet I can understand the argument at least a little.</p>

<p>I know this feeling well. Some of the people I have unfollowed is simply because of the way some of their posts make me feel.

<p>We were <a href="https://micro.blog/JeffPerry/10961046">conversing on micro.blog about Craft.do</a>, and I replied saying that “I just don’t get it”. The ‘it’ I was referring to is the hype around the app at the moment. I do understand the app, it seems really powerful and, to its part, fairly straight forward to get to grips with powerful features. I just find it very strange that some apps seem to go through these periods of evangelical usage and coverage that seem to spout from no where.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.craft.do">Craft</a> is the current hotness, it has a small period when it first came out too, <a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a> also has these periods of expansion where it appears that not only is everyone using it, everyone is talking about how they use it, and telling you to try it out. I find it interesting that some services seem to be able to cultivate these periods of growth that spark in all of us some form of FOMO. It is these periods that I don’t ‘get’.</p>
<p>I guess this is why influencers exist and marketing people are paid so much money for the work they do. Paid to create conversation around the app and motivate people to go and learn about the app and see if it is for them. There is a whole world out there of ‘set up’ videos and blog posts of people telling you why this app is the best things ever. There’s a weird world of productivity videos out there and <a href="https://gr36.com/a-new-productivity-app-wont-make-you-more-productive/">a new app rarely makes a difference</a> without a change in you.</p>
<p>Although I have been working really hard to limit my subscription expenditure due to fatigue. More often that I care to admit I get swept away in these waves and spend money far too easily on apps I no longer use a week later!</p>
<p>BTW: Awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8raOG7HXJoCUygx219fU4A">YouTuber Chris Lawley</a> has an upcoming video on Craft so make sure you’re subscribed to his channel if you do want to find out about it.</p>

  Most writers started writing to please the search engines (later just one search engine). To feed the beast, more “original” content was needed. The sharing moved to social media and got lost with the ephemera. Writers burned out producing longer and longer posts for ad pennies over trust and community.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This has been playing on my mind recently and CJ sparked a thought in my head before it had formulated properly. I too love writing link posts, just taking a paragraph or two and expanding your thoughts on the subject. I’ve promised myself to write more of them, but I think many people view them as a cheap way to turn out content.</p>
<p>However this post prods me to wider thoughts about what to write. About pandering to algorithms and news feeds just to get clicks or views. It comes up <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisWilmshurst/status/1354736032835645443?s=20">time and time again</a>, and if you need the metrics you simply have no choice but to pander to the platforms and make the content that ranks.</p>
<p>But I am joining the ranks of those that refuse to write longer form posts just because, or sign up for courses on how to rank higher in algorithms. I want to write whenever and whatever I want, and so should you.</p>

     <p>Sending email newsletters from Ghost can be a daunting experience, especially if you have not done anything like this before. A big issue I have come across is the signup form not working for people trying to get set up. It either does nothing, or just spins and doesn’t set up a subscriber.</p>
<p>This is more than likely due to the email service and nothing you have done wrong. Emails are actually split into two types on Ghost so you might be able to send out a newsletter to thousands of people, but none of them are able to log in. The two types of emails sent by your Ghost install are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bulk – Your actual newsletter. So you can send test emails and posts out to all of your subscribers.</li>
<li>Transactional – These are everything else. Sign up emails, log in emails and everything else to do with memberships.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re having issues these areas are where to check.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-mailgun-api">Set Up Mailgun API</h2>
<p>Chances are you’ve already done this, most guides walk you through this part. Head into your Labs section, turn on Members and at the bottom under Email Newsletter settings paste in your Mailgun API and the domain you are using.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img class="kg-image" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6fac857dfa.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>If in doubt click on the links under the boxes to head straight to the area you need in Mailgun. Don’t forget to change your region to EU if you have an EU flag next to your domain.</p>
<p>This will enable you to send all your ‘bulk’ emails.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-smtp">Set Up SMTP</h2>
<p>Depending on where you host your Ghost blog, this part may not be needed, however if your on <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/how-to-host-your-own-ghost-blog-on-digital-ocean/">Digital Ocean like me</a>, you’ll need to send your transactional emails by SMTP and not direct from your server.</p>
<p>SSH into your droplet and</p>
<pre><code>nano /var/www/ghost/config.production.json
</code></pre>
<p>Then copy in this code to replace the mail JSON item that is there already. Changing the “user” and “pass” to your own Mailgun details.</p>
<p>If you have a droplet in the EU change the “host” to your version.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">“mail”: {
“from”: “Your name ”,
“transport”: “SMTP”,
“options”: {
“service”: “Mailgun”,
“host”: “smtp.mailgun.org”,
“port”: 465,
“secureConnection”: true,
“auth”: {
“user”: “your_user_name”,
“pass”: “your_password”
}
}
},
</code></pre>
<p>Also set the email you want these transaction emails to appear from as this is different from your newsletter ones. An email address that is in use anyway is advisable to avoid spam filters.</p>
<p>This should allow you to send all of your transactional emails.</p>
<h2 id="check-domain-and-ssl">Check Domain And SSL</h2>
<p>This is the part that drove me crazy. I have set everything up and still my Ghost members subscribe from did not work. This was due to a miss match in the domain set up in my production.json. So head back into there:</p>
<pre><code>nano /var/www/ghost/config.production.json

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>This is the type of headline that usually sounds the alarms and announces shutting down a service. Thankfully this is quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Since <a href="/2021/01/28/i-didnt-want.html">moving my blog back to WordPress</a> I’ve been looking at what to do with my newsletter. It was the biggest sticking point that almost sent me back a step, but I am much happier posting to the indieweb. So I began looking around. The trendy <a href="https://www.getrevue.co">Revue</a> was an option however importing old issues was a Hughe issue. I settled eventually on the place where everyone else is – Substack.</p>
<p>As time went on and I got things set up, I just couldn’t get comfortable with this. There is nothing wrong with the service, and loads of people use it happily. I just have a few worries about services giving things away for free, they always eventually have to recoup it somewhere (looking at you Medium). There also is no way to turn off tracking, another thing I am not comfortable with. As such I just didn’t want to get invested in a service that I wasn’t 100% on.</p>
<p>So I built my own version. <a href="https://email.gr36.com">Greg Thinks Things</a></p>
<p>This will make it easier for signing up, viewing old versions and means I can keep control of everything from start to finish. No tracking, no third parties – just me and you like an email should be.</p>
<p>If you’ve subscribed already nothing changes. The emails will come to you from my personal email address and you can just email me back if you want to get in touch. I’m looking forward to sending the next one so if you’ve not signed up already there is no better time to do it.</p>
<p>Also my membership is no more. Thank you to all those that have been contributing, the money had 100% gone towards hosting. I will look at options to offer a paid service with perks I the future depending on how things go.</p>

<p>A million times this. I have lost count of the number of people that lose themselves and their personality online.</p>
<p>It’s not just about creatives, although this quote is talking directly to them – “link in bio” – it’s about being yourself. I’m guilty of this recently and it’s a big reason I pulled away from social media. You become a voice of whatever it is your peddling. Be it your content, your workplace or even just yourself.</p>
<p>Losing personality and approachability loses the whole reason for being social in the first place. We’ve spoken about it being <a href="https://gr36.com/not-being-a-fan-boy-is-hard/">hard to not be a fan boy</a>, but being one for yourself is a terrible place to end up.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s said a bad workman always blames his tools. An old saying yes, but it’s always clear when people feel responsible they look to shift the blame to other things. A faulty saw causing a wonky cut is one thing, but how about a smartphone ruining society?</p>
<p>It’s true that almost all the big players in mobile applications use some unsavoury tactics to keep you using them. Notifications, dark patterns and a number of dirty ticks all in the name of growth. Designed to get your data, spend your money or keep you engaged with whatever service it is that they are peddling. But here’s the thing, you still have a choice.</p>
<blockquote><p>Think about this phone. You can use this cellphone to gossip. You can use this cellphone to tell lies. You can use this cellphone to tell some really great jokes. You can use this cellphone to expose corruption, inequality, bad behaviour. What’s important is that we actively think about how we use it, how it affects our lives and our societies, and learn from it. – <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/mike-pondsmith-cyberpunk-2077/616924/">Mike Pondsmith</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Can you class a smartphone as a tool? It certainly helps you get things done. Helps you achieve the goals that you want it too. Stay connected, be productive or snap the photos you want to snap — but to be truly a tool, it shouldn’t require anything back from you.</p>
<p>My hammer doesn’t make a noise because I haven’t put many shelves up for the last few weeks. Outlook doesn’t pester me to send more emails. Tools ask nothing in return for their purpose. However, it’s really all about how you use the tool.</p>
<p>My iPhone doesn’t really ask much of me. I can <em>choose</em> to load apps onto it that allow me to communicate or I can load some that waste my time. That’s the choice we all can make, and some responsibility must lay at our feet. Even the apps that ‘waste our time’ are also tools to be used which ever way you see fit. Twitter enables real time communication to millions of people. Facebook has the best suit of communication apps we have ever seen, used for everything from peer support to psychiatry at a distance. Modern tools built from ones and zeros instead of wood and metal just need a little bit more moulding and a lot more will power.</p>
<p>With a little work we can <em>choose</em> to shape our tools to our own usage. Mediate the distractions they peddle and contain the downsides. Making the tools work for us as they should have done from the start.</p>

<p>How many of us want to be someone that does x but don’t want to actually do x. It could be writing, running or just being a happy person. It doesn’t matter what it is, the thought of it is often more enjoyable that the thing itself.</p>

<p>
<p>This isn’t all of my work, and all the technical stuff was done by Tim Nahumck in his <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-4-siri-shortcuts-wordpress-and-more/">drafts review</a> it just needed updating and tweaking a little as Shortcuts evolves.</p></p>

<p>You can write a post in pretty much any app you have now. Use Markdown format though as the shortcut looks for # to set the title and removes all this for you. See my screen shots for an example of my Apple Notes publishing.</p>

     <p>After denying it for quite a while, I succumbed to getting myself a third-party mouse, and you can’t buy anything other than the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/mx-master-review/">MX Master 3</a>. It’s more comfortable, more accurate and is packed full of power user features that allow you to mould its usage to your will. There is one small issue though, every so often an update comes around which causes the mouse to freeze and disconnect at random intervals — but here’s the fix.</p><p>If you have this issue, each time the MX Master 3 freezes up you will notice random Bluetooth devices connect and disconnect before disappearing. This happens at random intervals and lasts for anywhere between a few seconds up to a minute. All the time you will be unable to use the mouse. It looks something like this.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/626d5000f0.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>The issue stems from Apples use of hand off.

  Memberships are not about a money grab at all, they are about people being rewarded for their efforts, but also to know that people enjoy what they are putting out. Bloggers don’t always get page views; we don’t have subscriber counts or post likes – so these types of things help.

<p>I wanted to try and get something back for the years I have put in. Granted many of them failing and kidding myself, but they are still years — tens of thousands of tweets, photos, podcast episodes and hosting all for free.</p>
<p>I longed to be supported and feel at least a little bit of validation. I am amazingly thankful for the people that contributed, but my membership failed. Getting no where near the response I expected form the people around me. My post reads still come from Google searches and not from social media.</p>
<p>Does that mean my efforts where in vain? I still got the enjoyment out of it. Typing away, editing away or just talking to people.</p>

<p>This was a big sticking point for me at the start. However I forward all my email to my hey email address and use the actual address very rarely.

  So I want to stop some emails getting through to me, but also once I’ve dealt with an email I want it to get out of the way.

<p>I would LOVE Hey to be inbox zero, however everything hangs around instead. There are really well thought out ways to save emails for later so I have no idea why the others don’t go from your inbox but it’s not a game changer for me.</p>

  I’ll try to write about anything I try along the way, and hopefully, I can find a solution that fits my needs.

<p>I get too much email, but thankfully using Hey has helped a lot. Its not perfect and I wish I habd looked at sane box before jumping in, but I’m excited to see where Chris gets to.</p>

  You don’t have to be a communist to appreciate the force of Marx’s observation: “The worker does not make use of the working conditions. The working conditions make use of the worker; but it takes machinery to give this reversal a technically concrete form.” Well, we may not work on assembly lines in factories as much as formerly, but I can’t help seeing the contemporary gymnasium, with its emphasis on training with machines, as a strange sort of nostalgia for that state: working out in lieu of… working
</p></blockquote>
<p>Will is a brilliant author, with a passion for walking and saving yourself the grind in more pointless pursuits. To be honest I don’t think I can ever see myself going back to a gym, but I don’t think my realisation is the same fit everyone.</p>
<p>Running on a treadmill and using a statuary bike is unfortunately all some people have access to. Running, or cycling around the streets of some cities needs to become a much easier and much safer pursuit – but I can see the ridiculousness of doing it at a gym.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  During lockdown, people were doing sit-ups, press-ups and even lifting weights in parks and other open spaces, but as soon as the gyms reopened, many disappeared back indoors. I really cannot understand this. To me, the most bizarre sight in the world is someone on a running or cycling machine, rather than running, cycling,

<p>I was hoping the community exercise that I saw in the spring and summer would continue, but I some people seem institutionalised to return to an indoor gym if they possibly can.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>For some reason I managed to miss all of the build up to this book despite Ready Player One being one of my favourite books. So catching this the day it was released was a rear period of excitement and hunger to get reading.</p>
<p>I held off until I have finished the book I was on, so reviews and criticism was already flying all over the internet by the time I turned the first page. Despite these I went straight in with an open mind, but a longing for it to be as good as RPO.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it isn’t. RPT isn’t a bad read, and well worth it for those longing for a new story but don’t expect it to capture your heart. All of the right pieces are in the right places, but for some reason it feels overplayed, padded out by about 30%, and manages to pull on non of the nostalgia strings it should.</p>
<p>I found myself skimming large parts of the text in an attempt for the plot to get to the point much quicker. Although the story is somewhat well rounded, it feels like a book written to be made into a movie due to its lack of detail in some elements of the story but in-depth nitpicking on the 80’s trivia.</p>
<p>Ready Player Two is well worth picking up and reading but does not hold a candle to the first book.</p>
<h3>Book Notes</h3>
<blockquote><p>that this invention has the power to drastically alter the nature of human existence. I think it could help humanity. But it could also make things even worse. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B08CGP9TJ7&amp;location=368">Location 368</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Drawing parallels between this and [[Project Human]] with Zichey and <a href="https://www.projecthuman.fm/show/2-rene-ritchie">Rene Richie</a>. This quote would not have stood out to me so much had I not just listened to this episode.</p>
<p>Leading to my post on <a href="https://gr36.com/people-think-about-stuff/">Do People Actually Think About This Stuff?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>agree that everyone should balance their time in the OASIS with equal time in reality. But it’s not our place to mandate how our users live their lives. Growing up in the stacks would have been hell for me if I hadn’t had access to the OASIS. It literally saved my life. And I’ve heard Aech say the same thing.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B08CGP9TJ7&amp;location=803">Location 803</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>My online life is very similar. It has been the saviour of myself so many times that I cant even give attribution to them all. The amount of awesome people I have met is crazy high, yet social media is the worst, most toxic place I have even been.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, I knew the haters’ opinions were utterly meaningless, and had no effect whatsoever on our real lives. Unless, of course, we let it. Which, of course, I did. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B08CGP9TJ7&amp;location=1033">Location 1033</a>)</p></blockquote>
<h2>Social Media as a great filter</h2>
<blockquote><p>was even beginning to wonder if the invention of a worldwide social network was actually the “Great Filter” that theoretically caused all technological civilizations to go extinct, instead of nuclear weapons or climate change. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B08CGP9TJ7&amp;location=1065">Location 1065</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this is a fascinating idea, the other civilisations got to sage where they developed social media and it caused the death of their society too. I wonder how this fits into Dunbars number? Could it be that we are simply no meant to be able to talk and interact with so many people that the thoughts and ideas spreading will eventually ruin the world? This is a bit too real currently!</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe every time an intelligent species grew advanced enough to invent a global computer network, they would then develop some form of social media, which would immediately fill these beings with such an intense hatred for one another that they ended up wiping themselves out within four or five decades. Only time would tell. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B08CGP9TJ7&amp;location=1067">Location 1067</a>)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“Some people define themselves by railing against all of the things they hate, while explaining why everyone else should hate it too. But not me. I prefer to lead with my love—to define myself through joyous yawps of admiration, instead of cynical declarations of disdain.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B08CGP9TJ7&amp;location=1588">Location 1588</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>If only more people, myself included at time could lean into this. Even this books reviewers should have studied this passage a little better. Life is not for explaining why things are wrong all the time, it’s for enjoying the take away and the little things you <em>do</em> enjoy.</p>
<blockquote><p>The mind is the only thing about human beings that’s worth anything. Why does it have to be tied to a bag of skin, blood, hair, meat, bones and tubes? No wonder people can’t get anything done, stuck for life with a parasite that has to be stuffed with food and protected from weather and germs all the time. And the fool thing wears out anyway—no matter how much you stuff and protect it! —Kurt Vonnegut Jr. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B08CGP9TJ7&amp;location=5681">Location 5681</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>This might be the fact I am playing CyberPunk at the moment but reading back on these things makes me draw parallels to all sorts of things. Synthetic modifications to our biology is only a matter of time and could draw into questions what exactly a human is because we could begin to steer very far away from homosapiens. Certainly <a href="https://tim.blog/2020/10/27/yuval-noah-harari/">Yuval Noah Harari</a> believes so.</p>

     <p>In a broad sense of the word I understand the need for answers, but this need in modern times seems to be one of the most dangerous things around. In a world that contains a virus killing thousands of people every day, conspiracy theories are ravaging the planet and causing irreparable harm.</p><p>People have always created stories to try and explain away things that they do not understand. In older times attributing things to god or gods, but in more modern times these attributions have been replaced by arguably something more crazy. Everything from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-53416247">the pricing of furniture</a> to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html">names of fast food restaurants</a> seems to be a hint at an organisation pulling the strings of everything, and it’s getting a little ridiculous.</p><p>Unfortunately according to research, we just can’t help it. The human brain is hardwired to find patterns in everything, and as a reward when we find such a pattern our brain releases Dopamine. The same chemical released at more pleasurable times, and one that is easy to become <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/dopamine-addiction">addicted to</a>.</p><blockquote><em>The pleasurable feeling that our explanation is the right one—ranging from a modest sense of familiarity to the powerful and sublime “a-ha!”—is meted out by the same reward system in the brain integral to drug, alcohol, and gambling addictions. —</em><br /><br /><em><a href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/our-brains-tell-stories-so-we-can-live">Robert Burton</a></em></blockquote><p>Anthropologically it makes sense for us to be able to quickly and easily identify patterns to cut down the time we need to recognise things. Once you’ve noticed a dangerous animal, different parts of your brain will work together to process what you’re seeing and recognise it easier going forward. Our brain then leans into a false positive bias because it’s better for us to run from something that could have been a danger but isn’t, then spend time confirming it.</p><p>It’s uncomfortable for us to not understand what we are seeing or what is going on. Just as building and understanding a pattern leads us to a reward, the reverse is true, faulty patterns or confusion leads our brain to diminish that dopamine release we crave. When you look at conspiracy theories biologically, trying to explain away strange things happening, or building up a whole narrative to explain vague predictions, is completely natural.</p><p>Creating stories for ourselves and, now we have platforms to do so, sharing them with others is the “narrative equivalent of correlation” according to Robert Burton. “It is easy to understand why our brains seek out stories (patterns) whenever and wherever possible”.</p><h2 id="telling-our-stories-to-our-community-helps">Telling Our Stories To Our Community Helps</h2><p>We feel compelled to tell stories, even incomplete ones, as if they are the truth — because we believe that they are. Too hungry for the dopamine hit that we not only get from creating the story but also the validation from others, we overlook contradictory information even in the face of opposing proof.</p><p>That social aspect of retelling these stories is also as dangerous due to our need for others to validate both our survival and our happiness. Validation from others for the stories we tell releases an important chemical in our brain for feeling safe and welcome. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_J._Zak">Paul J. Zak</a> published research to suggest that Oxytocin, released when we are shown kindness and feel welcome, plays a key role in whom we believe we can trust. Some research <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_J._Crockett">also suggests</a> that Oxytocin plays a role in gloating and bias against other groups.</p><p>Creating possibly the perfect storm for our brains. Not only do we receive reward for creating stories, we also have a tendency to disbelieve those that appose them and only trust those that validate us. In these modern times of curated feeds and group recommendations it’s not hard for us to find a welcoming community, one that strives to explain away the world to us. What possible reason is there to test our theories when they are validated for us from the people we trust?</p><h2 id="cult-like-behaviour-is-easy">Cult Like Behaviour Is Easy</h2><p>Issues like these have existed forever. In-pre internet times the stories we had were explained to us by our family, or people in positions of power to keep us safe. In modern times it’s easy to find a connection and find some importance in the world. It’s even more exciting when the pattern you crave to understand is apparently being hidden from everyone, yet you’ve solved it!</p><blockquote>What a movement such as QAnon has going for it, and why it will catch on like wildfire, is that it makes people feel connected to something important that other people don’t yet know about — Cult Expert Rachel Bernstein</blockquote><p>In a time when there is more information available to the general population than ever before, we find ourselves with large portions of the population disbelieving proven facts and sharing stories that are false. With social platforms pretending they don’t understand the issues at play. Humans already have a tendency to stick together with people that trust and share common interests, and cult like behaviour is bred by those platforms seeking to increase engagement on their service without much care for consequences.</p><p>We are becoming increasingly aware of the effect that social platforms have on the spread of cult like behaviour, yet it starts clearly with natural processes. In large numbers we are often quick to dismiss those who believe something difference as lacking intelligence. When in fact creating or believing in conspiracy theories has no link to intelligence. In fact, those with a high recorded IQ can explain away information that disagrees with them more easily and rid themselves of the discomfort that comes from conflicting information.</p><blockquote>“Tell him you disagree and he turns away. Show him facts or figures and he questions your sources. Appeal to logic, and he fails to see your point … Suppose that he is presented with evidence, unequivocal and undeniable evidence, that his belief is wrong: what will happen? The individual will frequently emerge, not only unshaken, but even more convinced of the truth of his beliefs than ever before.” — Stanley Schacter</blockquote><p>A cognitive behaviour know as Motivated Reasoning is linked to how, in the face of often overwhelming evidence to the country, individuals can remain steadfast in their belief. Over the last few decades people have been convinced to <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/11/14/o-guru-guru-guru">leave everything behind</a> and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown">kill their whole community</a> by those telling compelling stories.</p><p>Stories we are addicted to discovering and reaping their dopamine reward. Stories that can lead us down paths never taken, and some that are now out of control.</p>

<section class="e-content post-body">
     <p>Whilst writing some daily thoughts out I have recently been trying to formulate where my Social Media presence is going in 2021. Setting goals in what to achieve regarding blog posts, videos and all sorts of things is all well and good, but the web, and Twitter specifically, is where I spend frankly ridiculous amounts of time. I’ve been there for <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36">11 years and tweeted more than 38,000 times</a> (not any more they are all gone). About what I can only shed some vague guesses but every time I see those figures I really start to wonder why.</p><p>Why is it that I feel the need to share my life with others online, and especially on Twitter, a platform aimed at following people you don’t really know very well at all. To be honest looking from the outside, and really taking stock, it’s hard to understand why any of us share anything on Social Media. The platforms must have built such a homely atmosphere that makes us all feel so comfortable we share intimate and personal details on to a web that is often open, relentless and at points unforgiving.</p><p>Posing this question on Twitter is met with the warm and fuzzy replies you would expect from people that are ingrained in the platform, but every now and again I just can’t help but question myself. Why do I believe that other people, with equally busy lives, need to read what I am doing, reading, watching and sometime even eating? I have tweeted more things in the past 11 years than times I have updated my family what I am up to. In fact, I would never share most of what I tweet into more personal avenues.</p><p>Sharing based on those more personal networks makes sense. Facebook exploded by piggybacking on connections existing in the real world. Posts became a digital extension of your real identity and personality because it really was.</p><p>You became Facebook friends with your real life connections allowing them to see into your everyday life. But as the Facebook population grew to billions — your friends list grew to include family members, co-workers and that friend of a friend you thought was cool but turned out to be a bit racist — it all gets a bit much. Managing expectation can be exhausting and curating a feed that entertains but is also varied. With all these on your friends list you are expected to have one identity, one digital face that is a recreation of your normal life.</p><p>Having one identity and sharing to those close to you, well, at least a bit closer, has now devolved back to more personal networks. iMessage and WhatsApp groups are the new normal points of contact for the self-expression when you are not meeting in person. With no need to mediate your online work, or create a <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/finsta">Finsta account</a> because your parents are on Facebook. As well as Twitter, Snap Chat and whatever else the new hotness is.</p><p>You see, Social Media in its current form feels like the old web. A small evolution from bulletin boards, without the anonymity, but asking much more from you. Based on old ideas and clinging to the importance by the smallest of threads by putting more and more services into their apps. Starting as the place where everyone you knew hung out online, but devolving into <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="/2020/09/01/the-trickle-down.html">attention seeking contests that demand more and more of your time</a>.</p><p>Twitter feels too flat and rigid in its approach to Social Media. It’s less personal than it really should be in the world we live in. People follow me for no doubt the tech stuff, but get switched off by my other interests and personal posts. I constantly find interesting people to follow, and then click unfollow due to American politics or sports bleeding into my time line.</p><p>In many ways Google Plus got it right all those years ago, by sharing to specific circles the reach of posts were reduced, but in return you only showed people what you wanted to show them. Could a more modern approach be found to separate identities and build a place to express yourself in different ways without putting others off?</p><p>Twitter and Facebook still feels too much like shouting into the void and waiting for the replies. Many of which never arrive because we all have hundreds of people to follow and simply can’t keep up with it all. Clicking follow on more and more people to give ourselves more and more to look at, for no other reason than ‘that’s just how it’s done’.</p><p>Social Media isn’t going anywhere, but some are feeling the same pinch points that I feel and are starting to wonder where to go from here. The answer may be to spread yourself over many things, at least until Social Media becomes more social again.</p>

     <p>Twitter is great for me. It&rsquo;s open, varied and has provided me with a platform to meet some good friends what I would have no other way of interacting with. Sometimes it’s a bit of a dumpster fire when Apple releases something or a major event happens but is bearable again after a few hours. Yet, the platform has been almost insufferable for more than 5 years now and the depressing state of American Politics is starting to swallow the internet.</p>
<p>When browsing Twitter you can usually avoid most things with a few blocked accounts and some careful curation of keywords when news stories start to break. It takes some work, but you can get 90% of the way there with a little effort. Yet, at some point, it reaches the point of diminishing returns and feels a little like you’re fighting a raging inferno with a garden hose. Which is easy to sort, you just don’t use Twitter — even though it used to be one of your favorite places to hang out.</p>
<p>Which feels a little like the bullies from school kicking you out of your treehouse but there are much more important things in life. However, what exactly can I do when almost every platform I use is bleeding American Political information, half of which is aimed at causing a fallout, on every visit?</p>
<p>No doubt the topics discussed are important, but they are also depressing, annoying, uninteresting, and fail to have a direct effect on my life. However, it is rammed down my throat at every turn. Reddit is somewhat understandable when you stray into the trading tab, but <a href="https://app.getpocket.com/discover">Pocket is filled with recommendations</a> to read yet more dressing news and even newsletters I previously loved contain nothing but information that heads straight to the bin.</p>
<p>If these sorts of posts are important to you — great, keep on sharing them and taking part in the discussion — but where can I go to avoid such things other than hitting the off button completely? Calls for American Politics filters on platforms started out as a joke by users, but now need to become reality sooner rather than later. For risk of turning people away, and alienating the majority of the world. Please help us, we are drowning in other people&rsquo;s worries.</p>

<blockquote><p>But the internet is not Facebook or Twitter, and it shouldn’t be. Fifteen years ago, the major social-media platforms barely existed. Was the internet better or worse? The online public square, now dominated by Twitter, was then constituted of independent blogs aggregated by user-curated feeds. Bloggers are publishers, legally responsible for their posts, but the blogosphere was not noted for its blandness. White-hot critique was common, but defamation and abuse were not. — <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/trump-fighting-section-230-wrong-reason/617497/">Silas House</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I love the web. It is my favourite place to be when it’s functioning well and the people are nice. However, more and more tending to the social media garden is required to make these platforms a nice place to be. I am glad to say I have suffered very little abuse, but not zero, my main issue is the tendency of false and at a time frankly ridiculous information to come up in my feed.</p>
<p>There are numerous users that seem to think the internet gives them the right to publish absolutely anything they like and not ever be held accountable. Platforms have almost zero motivation to clamp down on those harassing and abusing individuals. because it maximises engagement. With even less attention payed to controlling the information placed on them.</p>
<p>I am firmly of the belief that Social Media platforms should be held accountable for the information published to it by their users. With the ability to remove, and punish anybody found to be abusing their ability to post to the web. The right of free speech does not mean every user has the right to an open platform.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing push by a section of the US to remove section 230 that protects internet giants from this. Although this is for completely different reasons, I think that by changing the protection it holds will lead to a much better internet and one that flourishes with independent thought published by individuals. The public square of the internet needs to be decentralised and moved back to a time when everyone had their say but was also accountable for everything they chose to publish.</p>

     <p>Whenever I introduce someone new to mediation, they always look at me a bit quizzically. Not sure if I am being serious or wondering how I have hidden my woo-woo tendencies so well. Expecting me to suggest they go and sit in a cave for a week or buy some new orange robes.</p><p>You see, the vast majority of people seem to think that meditation involves sitting crossed legged on the floor, humming to yourself, or other such tropes seem to be very widespread. When in fact it is the simplest, humblest practice you can do, just sitting and paying attention to only your breath.</p><p>It seems bizarre the first time you try out a guided mediation, and you can’t concentrate on your breathing for more than a few moments. Utterly humbling, a bit of a shock, and I wonder how many people will give up here because they think this is failing. However, that is part of the process of mediation — a <a href="https://rossstevenson.medium.com/meditation-is-bicep-curls-for-your-mind-4b4c704682fd">bicep curl for the mind</a>.</p><p>There is no woo-woo, no magic and no new technology involved. One of the oldest and simplest practices in the world will teach you more about yourself than anything else, and it requires absolutely no outlay.</p>

<p>I have been transfixed with one of the best podcasts I have ever listened to. <a href="https://www.airr.io/episode/5f996887ecce6a84de95fb83">Yuval Noah Harari spoke to Tim Ferris</a> for a little under two hours and left me with so much more to think about now regarding knowing suffering and also knowing yourself.</p>
<p>It is easy to find out what makes us happy, and what brightens our mood because it’s instant and identifiable. But what even is suffering and what it is doing to us is a much harder thing to pin down and solve. Pain is suffering, we can understand and highlight the issue and at least try and solve the issue.</p>
<p>We don’t have enough money perhaps is causing us misery, so the easy solution is to try and get more money. However, is the money really the problem, or is it the illusion we need more money, or the things we buy that causing us to be miserable. As Yuval talks about there as much deeper mechanisms at play in our lives and without understanding them and ourselves we could be trying to solve proximal issues and not the real root causes.</p>
<p>Perhaps this links back to mindfulness and meditation above, but so many people I know are completely uncomfortable being alone with their own thoughts to a stage that they are constantly distracted from themselves. Knowing yourself and being aware of what is going on inside you is one of the most important things you can do to improve so many things in your life.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Silas House <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/trump-fighting-section-230-wrong-reason/617497/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fifteen years ago the major social-media platforms barely existed. Was the internet better or worse? The online public square, now dominated by Twitter, was then constituted of independent blogs aggregated by user-curated feeds. Bloggers are publishers, legally responsible for their posts, but the blogosphere was not noted for its blandness. White-hot critique was common, but defamation and abuse were not</p></blockquote>
<p>I keep coming across the opinion that 230 should be saved and if it is overturned then this would be the end of the internet. However, much like the link here, I am very much of the opinion that holding platforms more accountable should be the way to go if we want a better internet.</p>
<p>A Facebook or Twitter than can be sued for hosting content is one that is over the top in what can be posted to it – the result is a better, more positive experience.</p>
<p>Want to stay into the web and read what your favourite people are saying then we return to the good old blogging days, where speech is more honest and can be held accountable easily. No more hiding, no more click bate and we restrict the level of mis information being spread.</p>
<p>Clearly the reason that Conservatives want to repeal this bill has nothing to do with a safer internet, but I don’t think they would really get what they think if they succeed. Perhaps I don’t understand this fully but I really can’t see a downside.</p>

     <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I don’t play many games. I tell myself that this is because I don’t have time, but really it’s because I have such an addictive personality that I’m scared I’ll lose myself in to it, and I’ve got things to do! I don’t have any console, but turns out I did have things I could use to play Google Stadia and I bet you do to.</p>
<p>What motivated all this was the fact there are some games that I want to play. You know those titles that everyone around you seem to be playing, and you just want to join in. The last title that did this to me was Red Dead Redemption 2 that I purchased a PS4 pro to play and before the month was out sat gathering dust, ending up being sold on a little later.</p>
<p>This time it’s Cyberpunk 2077. A title that I really didn’t want to have to buy hardware to run it, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-10-cyberpunk-2077-is-super-rough-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-and-the-memes-have-already-begun">really don’t want to pick up an old console</a> to play it either. So, this is where Google Stadia comes in. The cloud streaming service that has been steadily improving over the last few months after poor release reviews, but might just be the place to play without having to splash too much cash on top of the line hardware.</p>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Googles solution to next-generation gaming is a streaming service that offers top of the line graphics without having to stump up the money for hardware. It’s a future that has been promised for some years now, and all of a sudden we have a few competing platforms that don’t work together.</p>
<h2>What do you need?</h2>
<p>Google Stadia requires very little to get you gaming. The most important of these things is a good internet connection. It doesn’t have to be the fastest in the world, but it needs to be reliable. In order to game wherever I wanted I’ve had to upgrade my router, but that shouldn’t be needed for most people. You will also need to check your data caps because you reusing upwards of 5GB per hour.</p>
<p>As far as hardware, you’ll first need a controller, any old one will do, I’ve been using a PS4 one I borrowed from a friend. As long as you can pair it with a mobile device you can get up and running in no time. One thing to bear in mind is that new Xbox controller don’t pair with all computers. You can stream stadia to ‘any device that runs chrome’. I’ve used my MacBook, iPad, iPhone and an ancient Chromebook all with good results. It also works flawlessly with mobile safari and also desktop Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> splash for a Stadia specific controller if you like. Which I eventually did and picked one up for £35 from CEX, but they are available direct from Google. Opt for the Premier edition if you can afford it for £80, and you’ll get a Chromecast ultra too. This means you can play on your TV with ease but again you can pick these up cheeper at resellers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/89a85c0b39.jpg" alt="Stadia Final Google 1" title="Stadia-Final-Google-1.jpg" border="0" width="599" height="337" /></p>
<h2>What can you play?</h2>
<p>Not every game is available on Stadia so don’t get too excited. There is a large range of games that are growing all the time like Cyberpunk 2077, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Hitman 3 (soon). However, there are loads of games missing, so this won’t replace a home console completely — yet. One noticeable absence for me is FIFA 21, but it’s <a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/11/05/fifa-21-google-stadia/">coming early this year</a>.</p>
<p>If you sign up for a free stadia account you’ll get a copy of Destiny 2 and Bomberman online completely free. Opt for the Pro subscription, and you can choose from a whole range of games to play for free while your subscription is live.</p>
<h2>How well does it work?</h2>
<p>On its initial launch Google Stadia was littered with poor connection issues and huge lag. Thankfully, this is pretty much gone. Lag will depend on your internet connection first, which I have a pretty stable and fast one. There are some impossible to diagnose issues that sometimes crop up, usually ISP related and can be solved by rebooting your rooter.</p>
<p>The UI of webpages or native apps takes a little getting used to as well as working out the options you have available when signing up. Hopefully, as the service becomes more main steam things like this will improve.</p>
<p>Finding games and starting one from your library could use some work, but when it comes to playing, I have experienced very few issues in my super-fast internet bubble.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/cccc32dc71.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2021 01 03 at 13 12 53 1" title="Screenshot-2021-01-03-at-13.12.53-1.png" border="0" width="1000" height="463" /></p>
<h2>What does it cost</h2>
<p>There are quite a few moving parts here, and the website is <a href="https://stadia.google.com/">more than a little confusing</a>. Google of course push you towards signing up without much information. To play Cyberpunk 2077, which is all I set to do, it set me back the price of the game (£50). I borrowed a controller and used an iPad I already had.</p>
<p>There are two free games included with your account Destiny 2 and Bomberman Online, so you can start playing for free. Opt for a ‘Pro’ subscription for £8 a month, and you can claim any of a growing range of games. However, you can only play this while you have an active subscription. Outside the games a pro subscription allows you to stream in 4k, with HDR also available depending on the speed of your internet connection.</p>
<p>There is a free month trial with no purchase necessary to try out a few games and get the feel of the place. Allowing you to play all currently available pro games for a month without a charge. Google sell a Premier Edition controller and Chromecast Ultra for £80 which is the most versatile option, but you can pick these up for very little money in other places.</p>
<p>Games vary in price from a few pounds to large amounts depending on the package you wish to buy.</p>
<h2>Sum Google Stadia up for me</h2>
<p>If like me, you want to play the occasional game and don’t want to spend hundreds on hardware. Chances are you can get going with things you already have or for very minimal outlay. Unfortunately, not all games are available but there is a large library of releases.</p>
<p>The most important thing you will need is a fast, stable connection. If that sounds like you, Stadia is a great way to play almost anywhere.</p>

<p>How many of us spend life flitting in and out of the present time? Any given moment, we are away and into our thoughts with limited awareness of what is going on around us. It’s good to sit and just think about things, but being present in the current moment is as relevant, and I believe this needs more attention and thought.</p>
<p>Only when you are aware of where your attention is that you become aware that it is very rarely on where it should be. Yet when I sit and think I often find myself unable to stay focused and succumb to distractions if I am not paying attention. My mind wanders all over the place, from thought to thought and down avenues that it really should not.</p>
<p>When I sit and meditate that I can begin to let things go and indeed empty my mind of thoughts, my mind becomes present, and I can focus entirely – the fog starts to lift. Mindful of where my thoughts are going and able to come back to what is essential.</p>
<p>Just thinking is harder than it seems in an age of constant stimulation, but not impossible. Thinking about things is not the same as letting your thoughts run free; it takes practice and attention to what is going on. Otherwise, there is a genuine risk or “miles away” from those around you.</p>

      <p>While redesigning my blog, and then doing it again, I thought long and hard about comments left on posts. I don’t get very many, all of which are from web mentions, but I like receiving them and wanted to consider them in the design. Giving them space was easy to do, but the most significant consideration is where to place the barriers to entry and its a harder decision than I thought.</p><p>When browsing jobs a few years ago, I was surprised how many didn’t have an online application processes, and many still required a handwritten application form. Naively I put this down to old companies not moving with the times; now I am convinced most of this is intentional.</p><p>Of course, you want the process to be as pain-free as possible, but making the application process too easy could potentially be even worse. Applying for the position all of sudden doesn’t need much thought, and applications submitted on a whim and leading to a much longer consideration process and an overall waste of time for all involved.</p><p>The same can be said for comments, make them too easy, like Youtube, and you can suffer from a deluge of half thought out impulse comment that means very little. Make the process too complicated and time-consuming, and you run the risk of putting everyone off. You’ll only receive the very extremes of comments, from the very highly motivated individual – be they good or bad.</p><p>So where do the barriers lie to produce the right amount of resistance, and receive the right amount of results? Perhaps I am overthinking things considering the low level of comments I have anyway. I started thinking about WordPress comments, but it opened ups whole new world of appreciation for intentional barriers to entry. – and I am yet to reach a decision.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For the last few months, I’ve had an itch at the back of my brain. Something I just couldn’t put my finger on and no amount of de-stressing or meditation seemed to fix it. The feeling was a strange one, one that I couldn’t place, and it was making me not feel myself. It wasn’t caused by any upset, nor by any illness or fatigue – it was because I had too much stuff.</p>
<p>The bits and pieces, the nick lacks and junk you pick up without going through life was starting to build up again, and it was making me feel stressed without even knowing it.</p>
<p>Minimalism hit me like a train at the end of 2016 after seeing the <a href="https://minimalismfilm.com/">Minimalism documentary</a> made by Matt D’Avella. I’d been spending far too much on things that didn’t make me happy, and were just to paper over other issues. It instantly spoke to me, and I began to slim down almost everything I owned. My wardrobe, my possessions and more importantly, my technology were all scrutinised. Slimming down made me much happier, my bank healthier and my outlook on life completely different.</p>
<p>I would say, a couple of weeks after, I was a completely different person. Enjoying different things, and engaging in different ways with my family, friends and the world online.</p>
<p>This year, the stuff has been creeping back slowly. Temptations to buy this and that have been fought off, but I haven’t been as ruthless with keeping accumulated items at bay. Bags have been hanging around full of freebies from events, not throwing away or donating items I no longer need. And worst of all, the stress of presents piling up for family members taking over my office space.</p>
<p>So this past week has been spent slimming down again (and fight off illness). I’m so glad I spotted this when I did, because its important to me to focus on essential things, and not let the unimportant rule my life. If you haven’t tried it already, give it a go, and I promise it will change you too.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I remember when watching the news each day was considered almost mandatory. To keep yourself up to speed and informed on essential events was considered the done thing. When did the reporting become so dirty and shameless? I don’t want to get into that here, but I do want to get into the App News app. It seems to be getting worse, and each time I try and use it, I have to battle through topics I have no interest in, to find a few bits I do.</p><p>I have been unable to clear away persistent Election updates since that whole farce started. Apple added it into my following section without asking, and there is no way to remove it. Apple has been shoving politics at me if I like it or not. I want to use the Apple News app because I can’t find an alternative, and since adding in magazines, it shows how horrible an app it is. Heres the thing, I think rolling magazines into Apple News was a huge mistake. The content doesn’t go together, and the two sides the app are drastically different.</p><h2 id="split-it-out">Split It Out</h2><p>The magazine tab features well-written and researched articles that look great. You only have to look at something like Men’s Health to see what digesting exciting publications can achieve. Content that flows well together, images fitting of the design and overall an impressive, immersive list of publications that matter.</p><p>Whereas the News tab is the polar opposite. News topics are forced into your face if you like them or not, with a massive influx of clickbait and dramatic headlines. They don’t seem to be selected by algorithm because I’ve never clicked on one, but Top Stories is constantly a cesspool. You’re never quite sure if the full story is going to be featured, or if you are going to have to head to the website anyway. There also doesn’t seem to be any monitoring of the content submitted, and overall I detest ever visiting the tab.</p><p>I have tried so many times to try and ‘fix’ the algorithm, spent weeks telling Apple I don’t want this type of story, but nothing makes a blind bit of difference. I have never come across anyone that’s subscribed to News +, but I certainly would if I didn’t have depressing, uninteresting News shoved in my face all the time.</p>

<p>It used to be the place I wanted to hang out. It looked like a utopia and promised so much – but unfortunately, it isn’t, and it has offered me very little. So, my micro.blog account is no more.</p>
<p>This is the second time I have deleted everything; the first time was to start again and work out a way to host my blog on the platform. However, as time has moved on, the blogging on micro.blog has dissolved into more ‘status updates’ and long threads (which are not threaded at all) or talking.</p>
<p>I wasn’t looking for another Twitter; I was looking for short microblogs and others that loved the things I did. The blog posts are still there and written by some fascinating people, but they are hidden under mountains of photos, and videos, and podcasts, and it is impossible to navigate the noise.</p>
<p>I can only presume others find the same because my interactions fell away to almost zero and micro.blog as a referee to blog posts dropped at an equal rate to completely zero. Could be my face doesn’t fit, could be a million different reasons but another network to try and carve out space in – no thank you.</p>
<p>There is also a real echo chamber on the platform; it is predominantly US-centric. I am not sure of the location of registered accounts, but the feeds and noise always appear very skewed towards American issues. However, this could be linked to discoverability, as it’s impossible to find people to follow without putting in real work – but enough about the negatives.</p>
<p>There are a few positive I have taken away from my year or more on the platform. Where I place my blog in my life is different now. I am more open to publishing my thoughts and less bothered about the length of my posts than I was.</p>
<p>So don’t look for gr36.micro.blog any longer – you won’t find it.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I am sure you don’t need me to tell you how good the AirPods are when compared to more or less anything else on the market. Since the original version hit the market, I’ve had a pair in my ears at some point in the day 80% of the time. They have worked out with me, walked miles with me and I’ve listen to hours upon hours of podcasts. I held off a little, but the new Pro version is a huge improvement – here are some tips and tricks I have picked up so far.</p>
<h2><strong>No Tappy Tappy</strong></h2>
<p>The new AirPods Pro feature buttons instead of an accelerometer that detects your taps. Of course the set up process guides you through new options for media controls but if you don’t pay attention fully it can be hard to work out what’s going on. Think of the button press as a squeeze of the microphone stem, you will feel a small click and an audio response if long pressing. It takes a bit of getting used to if you’ve used the original AirPods, but pretty easy to get used to.</p>
<p>• Single-press: Pause/play<br />
• Double-press: Skip forward<br />
• Triple-press: Skip backward<br />
• Long-press: Switch between noise cancellation and transparency mode.</p>
<h2><strong>Change Noise Cancelling Settings</strong></h2>
<p>The new AirPods pro feature active noice cancelling (ANC) with rubber tips to make a better seal in your ears. ANC can feel a bit strange at times and also shouldn’t be used every situation. Luckily there is a pretty neat ‘transparency’ mode which lets some noice from the outside world through, and also a toggle off.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Airpod-Pro-Screenshots-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/260065dc1c.jpg" alt="Airpod Pro Screenshots 1" width="1000" height="477" border="0" />Unless you have changed any of the settings, by pressing and holding on either the left or right AirPod button will cycle you AirPods through ANC on or off. The change the options, head into the Bluetooth setting when your AirPods are connected. You will see options for both the left and right AirPods button, you can then add in whatever options you wish to cycle through.</p>
<h2><strong>Activating Siri</strong></h2>
<p>We all love shouting “Hey Siri” during a workout or walking down the street, but if you want to set up activating Siri with a press instead of a voice a voice it’s really easy. Head into the Bluetooth settings as above, there is then a range of options for the left and right AirPod button. I have set this up for left to be noise cancelling and right to be Siri.</p>

<p>Rebecca Jennings <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/12/2/20983760/instagram-removing-likes-authenticity">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instagram has a way of flattening lived experiences so that my best years look exactly like my bad ones, and that everything seems pretty good, all the time, for everyone. This, obviously, is not how life works for most people, and ever since Instagram has existed experts have debated what seeing an infinite scroll of other people’s happy moments is doing to our brains.</p></blockquote>
<p>This exact the problem with a platform I used to love so much. Instagram has been taken over by the ego.</p>
<p>It is now simply a place to try and show off what you have and how great your life is (protein: it isn’t). You are not sharing to Instagram for you, you’re doing it to instil jealousy in people that see the photos. It makes them feel terrible, it makes you feel terrible – yet you still do it.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Notes apps are my kryptonite. I get sucked in quickly, send a few hours getting everything transferred over and use a different one for a few weeks. I’ve pretty much used them all, recently it was <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/using-apple-notes/">a return to Apple Notes</a>, and even more recently I have been <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/how-i-use-2/">using Agenda </a>for everything. Both of these apps are still great – but for writing out a post, there is nothing quite <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/bear-notes-app/">like Bear</a>.</p><p>Perhaps it’s the beautifully designed writing experience; maybe it’s the powerful exporting options or one of the many other reasons that make Bear green. I just can’t put my finger on why it’s so lovely to use.</p><p>Whether you are jotting down a quick note to yourself or starting a long page of prose, nothing will disturb your writing. Images can be inserted and formatted to your liking, meaning that as you type you will be looking at exactly how the document looks. This won’t make a blind bit of difference to simple notes, but perhaps it’s time to take your notes to the next level!</p><p>The sharing options of this Bear are right up there with a serious writing app. It offers the possibility for exporting the notes you have made in such a wide range of options it might take a while to work out which one you need. With a simple swipe left while viewing a note you can share in Text, Markdown, PDF, HTML, Rich Text, DocX, and if that wasn’t enough you can even export as an image. No more screenshots of your notes to publish on Instagram and Twitter.</p><p>Bear makes everything from writing stories to documents through to just jotting things down to remember a breeze – this is why I keep coming back.</p>

<p>Oliver Haslam <a href="https://www.imore.com/512gb-iphone-11-pro-max-costs-less-500-parts">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Which brings us back to my original point: these figures are interesting. But they can’t tell the whole story.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, a company tears down an iPhone 11 Pro and produces some costing involved. imore write a post about it and now I’m linking to it – all to say that these things don’t matter. I cant work out if I am part of the problem or if it’’s all rubbish anyway.</p>
<p>However that is to say that these sorts of posts come out every time a high profile phone is released and no one really pays attention other than a few publications that are seeking the clicks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This is how companies work, the cost of producing a product is less than the price you sell it for. No one is surprised right?</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s that time of the year again; the weather takes a turn for the worst and people (usually Americans) start moaning about having to shovel snow. These types of posts could be a little tongue in cheek, and I have no doubt you are excerpting yourself, but you don’t need a workout type. Some need adding to the Apple Watch such as sport types and training methods, which are slowly being increased- what it doesn’t need is ‘Yardwork’, ‘snow shovelling’ or rocking your baby.</p>
<p>Thankfully the Apple Watch team has now found its market. Instead of a spray and pray device that does everything, its aim is notifications and Heath. Motioning all your workouts and keeping you more engaged with people. Workouts and activity don’t need to be overly complicated by every single time you exert yourself by doing daily tasks. There is a risk of adding too much and again making the Apple Watch too cluttered and too complicated.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="apple-watch-workouts-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/5ec7f7796e.jpg" alt="Apple watch workouts 1" width="1000" height="399" border="0" /></p>
<p>These types of general are covered regardless of if you start a workout or not. It will detect your heart rate and movement increases and give you relevant move points. You’re exerting yourself so the activity ring will start to climb accordingly. If you’re dead set on recording it as a workout, start the ‘other’ one and then give it a name at the end if you’re ever going to review it. You’ll be forgiven to forget that there is another option because more often than not, it is hidden down at the bottom of your activity options.</p>
<p>You get the same activity credit as a brisk walk, which is around 60 calories per 15 mins. Which is pretty low if you are working hard, so your best bet will be to let your Apple Watch detect how hard you are working and adjust accordingly. You will move your red and yellow rings regardless of you paying attention to them or not – that’s the great thing about Apple Watch.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2019/11/20/how-i-use.html"><h1 class="p-name">How I Use Agenda</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Agenda-featured.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/ce935fbf77.jpg" alt="Agenda featured" width="1000" height="500" border="0" />For the last few weeks, I have been throwing my life into Agenda, I’ve played around with it previously, but this time it seems to have stuck. I’m one of those people that like to try out an app or service just because people are using it, and this is what I did in 2018 when Agenda won the apple design award. I think I had signed up previously to use it on Mac but didn’t hang around very long.</p>
<p>The only issue is this is a completely different approach to note taking. It ditches the somewhat traditional approach of a list of notes, in folders and turns it on its head. Everything is based around your calendar and dates. You can of course make notes without this, but its main power stems from tying into events in your life. For years I have been living out of my calendar and task management app (or apps), and I’ve been searching for a service that does it all for me. I feel like I have tried everything, from <a href="https://gr36.com/todoist-my-new-app-to-get-things-done/">Todoist</a> to <a href="https://gr36.com/using-notion-web-clipper/">Notion</a>, to more recently <a href="https://gr36.com/using-apple-notes-to-write-in-2019/">Apple Notes</a>. My life is split into to distinct area and Agenda is already benefiting me in both.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Work</strong></strong></h2>
<p>I am a development and engagement manager for a UK based insurance company. In essence, this entails a massive balancing act involving loads of meeting, emails and tasks to be completed. I work from an iMac at my desk, an iPad in conferences and an iPhone at every other time, so having a cross-platform app with great sync is required.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="agenda-usage-iphone-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4a85328499.jpg" alt="Agenda usage iphone 1" width="1000" height="477" border="0" /></p>
<h3><strong><strong>Meetings</strong></strong></h3>
<p>These are exchange meetings set up in Outlook, the only thing that stops me using Agenda for calendar management is the missing option to add invitees. This is not a massive issue for me, as I’m in Outlook for email anyway. From these events, I create all of my meeting preparation in Agenda, including all my written notes, clipped images some times also documents.</p>
<p>The benefit of being able to add in documents that I can refer too quickly in meetings is a godsend. The fact I don’t need to go into a room armed with loads of paperwork any more is a huge benefit. I also won’t lose any following it; if anything is handed to me, I can insert a scan of the document using my phone with a single click.</p>
<p>Granted this looks a little weird depending on who your meeting is with, thankfully my sessions are usually in tech or design people, and everyone else has just gotten used to my weirdness. Mainly because I can email a meeting review, including all documents, or print out a version within minutes of leaving the room. Exporting from Agenda is a massive benefit over something like Evernote or Apple Notes; it is powerful and flexible to fit into most situations.</p>

<p>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</p>
<h3><strong><strong>Collecting Info</strong></strong></h3>
<p>The second part of my job is producing content through various channels. For this, I have a section for work ‘in progress’ and create a project for putting things together. Mainly containing video scripts and outlines for blog posts, but some other random info I want to store. As much as Agenda is date focused, it works <em><em>ok</em></em> with saving some general info, but shouldn’t be seen as a note app replacement if you need to store loads of info. Because Agenda is date focused, I can collect all this together and make reminders right up to the ‘due date’.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Screenshot-2019-11-20-at-17.53.44-1.png" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/71dbd552b3.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2019 11 20 at 17 53 44 1" width="1000" height="672" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong><strong>Home</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The second part of my life revolves around my family. I am the parent of two children, one of whom is disabled, so date focused note-taking is more or less a given. Our calendar is filled full of hospital appointments, school events and other things that I need information on.</p>
<h3><strong><strong>Hospitals</strong></strong></h3>
<p>My agenda home section has a general project for my daughter’s hospital appointments, filled full of notes that refer to older appointments. No longer am I searching for information, or trying to remember what we discussed at the last appointment. Much like my work meetings, if I need to scan a medication label, or snap a picture of recommended equipment, I can put it right into the Agenda note. I also like to send my wife and parents a text with the notes in, which Agenda lets me do with a couple of taps.</p>
<h3><strong><strong>Technology</strong></strong></h3>
<p>I love writing and talking about technology, I’ve tried for more than seven years to stop, but something about it gets me excited. I take notes for upcoming episodes of my podcast, <a href="https://byodpodcast.com/">Bring Your Own Device</a>, linked to the calendar event I share with my co-host. I would love to have collaboration, this would cut out our show notes Apple Note, but these notes are for my talking points only.</p>
<p>I also outline and write every blog post I publish in an Agenda Note. Taking the same form as with my work life, what I love is that I can drag in images and text from other sources as reference.</p>
<p><br /><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8335452151565777" data-ad-slot="5524743860"></ins></p>
<p>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</p>
<h3><strong><strong>Features I would Like</strong></strong></h3>
<p>There aren’t many features that I feel are missing from Agenda, and I would be concerned if they tried to add in too much. Agenda is not a publishing platform, and in many ways isn’t a note-taking app. However, each feature is thought out so it can be adapted to many use cases. There are a couple I have mentioned already, being able to create calendar events with invites; however, I don’t even know if this is possible due to the many different calendars available. Collaboration would also be perfect, and in which case this may even become an option for teams, but just being able to write some show notes for my podcast would be great.</p>
<p>I would also like to see a focus mode, where I can write in one note. At the moment I am writing in a note that is inside the today view, or on the Agenda. It would be great to be able to open a note and no other information. With all this said, the app is pretty perfect for mine, and many other peoples use case, all the features implemented are well thought out, and the developer support is brilliant. I’m an active member of the Agenda community, so you can always come say hi!</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>It’s been a long time coming, but with the reproduction of colour into the iPhone line up with the XR, Apple released a clear case. The case has also appeared with the new phone line ups, available for the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro thanks to new colours in the lineup. Now I need to be straight to the point on this – Do Not Buy One.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to pick one up, show off that brand new Midnight-Green iPhone 11 Pro, or cool Yellow iPhone 11. If you choose to buy one in-store, you might even be pitched one to compliment your shiny new purchase, because you should show off the colour of them, the midnight green is my personal favourite, but at £45 you really shouldn’t.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="DSC0004-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/00d8675519.jpg" alt="DSC0004 1" width="600" height="600" border="0" /></p>
<p>The Apple cases are a bit like marmite, I love them because they fit and last the best I have found, but many people think they are a rip-off. Which is understandable given that most other cases are less than half the price of the stock options, but they do offer something different. The leather cases I have used last well and feel premium quality, whereas the silicone version provides a much more grippy surface. However, they charge what seems like more and more each year for the privilege.</p>
<p>The clear case feels like every other clear case on the market. The materials used are a little more robust than other clear cases, and the fit is perfect (as all ways with Apple cases). Some cheaper options are often flimsy and imperfect fitting but are a minute price when compared the Apple. What it doesn’t avoid is the same old issues that plague all clear cases – weird smudge marks and pocket lint build up.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="DSC0005-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9dd7051939.jpg" alt="DSC0005 1" width="600" height="600" border="0" /></p>
<p>To be fair almost every case in the world suffers from lint build-up, but because the case is clear, it is much more apparent. You might like showing everyone the lovely colour of your phone, but you’re also showing them you didn’t clean your phone in the last hour. When the phone is this good at avoiding fingerprints and smudges, its annoying the case isn’t – but no case can be.</p>
<p>If you are ogling to get a clear case, please don’t go for the Apple one. I made a mistake a purchased it along with a few other things and didn’t realise how expensive it is. Opt for a middle of the road option; there are plenty to choose from and save yourself some cash.</p>

      <p>Not clickbate. It’s been a great <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/one-year-of/">five years</a>, I have tried really hard to carry on as long as possible but iOS 13 has made me realise I cant continue any longer. I’m afraid friends, today was the day the end finally arrived, I’ve ditched an iPad altogether.</p><p>During my time working on the iPad I always needed a Mac around to podcast and edit things properly – you know do real work. It was pretty few and far between and during this time the iPad got better and better. Adding in a better keyboard, a pencil to write and draw as well as constantly improving the OS. My reliance on Shortcuts (then Workflow) and third party apps started to dwindle and iOS become a powerhouse – at least for a while.</p><p>Then iOS13 arrived. I cant point to one specific event or one particular bug, but iOS13 has been like death by a million paper cuts. Spending 15 minutes this morning trying to put an image into an Apple note may be the straw that broke the camels back, however the past few weeks and months have been a nightmare. Apple Notes takes an age to sync to my iPad, apps randomly crash or only partly work and I just cant take it any more.</p><p>This is all after spending weeks getting my head around the new multitasking and app pairing because they changed the way the iPad worked AGAIN. I feel like I’m splitting up with my long term partner now they have their stuff sorted and I’ve realised it wasn’t worth the pain after all. Load of people are now using the iPad like I have been doing for the past 5 years but <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/im-not-an/">I cant any longer</a>.</p><p>The iPad lost its way somewhere in the last year or so and become a device that isn’t fit for me any more. I am betraying my roots and going back to the Mac, I’ve ordered a MacBook Air and my iPad is all boxed up ready to sell.</p><p>Goodbye old friend.</p>

<p>[embed]<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=i1mVtJ4oVhQ%5B/embed%5D">youtube.com/watch</a></p>
</p>
<p>My first impressions were pretty impressed actually. I used the phone for around 4 hours and got to put it thorough all its paces, apart from battery life. That remains to be seen, but the small number of people that do have them in their packets are reporting pretty decent battery life.</p>
<p>When we first were handed the phones, the Samsung guy went into full-on PR mode. I get the impression that there have been a small number of people asking about the phone, and the company is concerned with the negative press. Which is spot on, they asked me through everything that was changed with the phone, and interestingly precisely what went wrong with the first version.</p>
<p>Having never touched the first version I can’t speak of the differences but the silver and black units I got to use were both very robustly built and are defiantly using quality materials. The weight is a little heavier than an iPhone 11 pro but considerably heavier than something like the Note 10+ I had in my pocket. The most surprising place you feel it is when it’s in your pocket, despite the slim form factor when closed you’re not going to miss this in your skinny jeans.</p>
<p>But what everyone wants to know is about that screen! I want to start on the front one; it won’t get much use. Almost everything that I tried to do was a hassle. This screen is going to be like the LCD screens on the front of flip phones. Only there to glance at and see what is worth opening your phone for.</p>
<p>You will be opening it – A lot. Because there’s no point having a folding phone and not showing it off right?</p>
<p>Samsung has added caps to the end of the hinge and made the ‘not a screen protector’ extended underneath the bezels. Combined with a few internal changes, most of the screen issues should be resolved. The hinge is tested for 200,000 actions, so should last quite a while. The problem is the tactile feedback from opening the hinge is so satisfying that I found myself playing with it quite a lot – although I’d need to do it about 280 times a day over two years to get near the limits.</p>
<p>The screen is bright crisp in all lights, you very quickly get used to its dominance, and it becomes especially useful when trying to take photos. The fold uses the same camera set up form the galaxy s10, with a wide-angle, telephone and ultra-wide lens – combined with the usually portrait effects and AR goodness you expect from Samsung.</p>
<p>Although the screen comes in handy for things like google maps and even reading webpages, its a little cumbersome for one-handed use give it has a strange 4:3 ratio. Youtube videos are particularly enjoyable, and even watchable when multitasking, but to feel the benefit you’ll need to go full screen, which features black bars on the top and bottom.</p>
<p>What you will enjoy is the Dolby Atmos audio, these sound great, particularly when enjoying videos that use great audio such as Peter McKinnon or some football highlights.</p>
<p>With all this said. This phone will spend most of its time unfolded. So you can enjoy the large screen you’ve paid so much money for. With a screen this big, it’s crying out for more use cases such as an S-Pen. Unfortunately, you can’t use one, or any other stylus for that matter. Samsung doesn’t want you to use anything on this display or even press too hard because it is plastic and not glass that most people are used to.</p>
<p>There is no getting around the crease in the middle of the screen; it is noticeable when viewing something light such as messages and lots of one UI. When the screen is off, it sticks out like a sore thumb. If you’re paying attention, you can feel it when swiping about, but I get the impression that it would become as forgettable as a natch in the screen do after a few days use.</p>
<p>There are a few quirks, such as the fingerprint sensor is separate to the power button, meaning it requires quite a bit of getting used to. And also the wireless PowerShare, which is a cool feature, is in a minimal area on the back of the handset.</p>
<p>With all said, I am very impressed with the unit overall. The £1,900 you will need to spend gets you a robust and well-built phone that feels premium. In the box, you” ll also get the Galaxy buds, and kevlar case and a year’s worth of Samsung Insurance. Which I get the feeling is an addition to combat worries on longevity.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how many people are going to buy this thing, but it’s a great phone to see on the market. If money is no object, jump on this and see the future, with a few caveats.</p>
<p>Give Samsung a couple of iterations to get things right, and I think this is going to be a stellar phone. In a few years, everything might be folding, and we will look at this space-age technology as the flip phones of old.</p>
<p>Bravo Samsung, thanks for inviting me down to take a look at the fold its defiantly a hit from me. I’m excited to see where it goes.</p>

<blockquote><p>Social media use also has an opportunity cost. If we’re at home snapping our friends on Snapchat or posting photos on Instagram, we’re not connecting with them in person. Even if we are with people in person, being heads-down on a device means that we miss out on meaningful interactions.</p></blockquote>
<p>I feel very mixed on social media, in one respect it has put me in touch with some people that I hoLd very dear in my life. People that I would never have met in ‘real life’ including my podcast co-host Nati who lives in Israel. But when I say social media I mean Twitter, because all others seem much more closed off.</p>
<p>On the other hand there is a huge amount of resentment I have towards platforms. I found myself being much less active and pretty passive now in terms of sharing things, simply because the culture at large is hugely negative when compared to a few years ago.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>I wanted t make a simple link post, but there were so many little things I wanted to pull out it just didn’t work. Jason Snell <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/opinion/iphone-deep-fusion-and-smartphone-cameras">wrote a long post for</a> Toms Guide about the incoming Deep Fusion camera technology and left me all confused.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<blockquote><p>Apple and its competitors know that smartphone buyers really do care about the camera more than anything else.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can’t agree with this, I don’t think the camera is the be all and end all for most people. It’s simply near enough the only thing that smartphones can differentiate themselves from each other. Every phone is ok, they all take photos that are good – but want to fight over who has the best niche features. I really don’t think most people that buy an iPhone 11 Pro give a dam about a little more detail in some areas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> They might buy the phone for a better camera than previous models, but they won’t jump on the bandwagon because of Deep Fusion. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>The iPhone’s Camera app is rife with little icons and stickers to indicate when a photo is being automatically cropped, when you’re grabbing Live Photo video to go with the still, and the like. And yet, at least in the iOS 13.2 beta, there’s no hint that you’re using Deep Fusion.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am a little confused still, I don’t see the point in Live Photos, I don’t feel a need for HDR the majority of the time, but here we are with a really confusing camera interface. Apple used to excel in the ability to pull your phone out and Snapp a really good photo almost instantly. Now I am bombarded with portrait modes, dark modes and even the option to make the camera 16:9.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Just do it all for me, and give me options afterwards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<blockquote><p>It gets even more interesting when you consider that some of these features are so subtle that you have to really pay attention, and make A/B comparisons, to see the difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t call it interesting – does anyone care of a jumper appears a bit more detailed. All in exchange for an image twice the storage size?</p>
<blockquote><p>but in the end, we’re all part of a culture that has fallen in love with the ability to never let a memorable life event go undocumented. Along with the ability to look up where you’ve seen that random character actor in that TV show before, it’s one of the greatest things about having a smartphone.</p></blockquote>
<p>All cameras are fine, we are obsessed with taking photos but I don’t believe it’s purely for memories.</p>

<p>Many people seem to forget this, Android has made a whole range of devices available at a seriously cheap price. I am not sure that much of the world would be as connected as it is without Google pushing it so hard.</p>

<blockquote><p>While remote SIM provisioning and a tiny secure chip are supposed to solve these problems, there’s still the issue of practicality. Checking and comparing data plans is easy enough online, but there’s currently not a good way to apply said plans quickly to your eSIM. Customers often have to pop into stores or buy eSIM packs, scan QR codes and mess around in settings menus. This is arguably more inconvenient than ordering a standard SIM.</p></blockquote>
<p>Having used an e-sim for more or less a year I can confirm its more hassle than it really should be. The real beauty of a standard sim is you can transfer it it seconds.</p>
<p>When I set up my iPhone 11 I had to pay £1.50 because I had already transferred it into an iPhone XS Max a few months before. Staff  in carrier stores are still unknowledgeable and I don’t feel it is a problem that needs ‘solving’.</p>
<p>There is a benefit to traveling, but it is not so much of a pain to buy a local sim that everything needs to built into the phone.</p>

<p>There are thousands of posts just like this all over the internet. Posting knowledge for others to consume as if they are some wise old prophet with a WordPress blog. Having read a few, there were some golden nuggets extracted, and I began to think about what I would tell myself if I could travel back in time.</p>
<h2><b>Don’t think you know everything</b></h2>
<p>This is one of the worst attitudes to take, and unfortunately, it seems a natural one. When you leave school all spirited and confident, indeed the world is your oyster, and you can do whatever you like. What you cant do is take it for granted, you don’t know everything, spend your time learning and growing.</p>
<h2><b>You are your own person</b></h2>
<p>Stand on your own two feet, other people might make you what you are, but they don’t live in your head. Be yourself and don’t be afraid to be that person at all times. Other people are not responsible for what you do or how happy you are.</p>
<h2><b>Hold your hands up often</b></h2>
<p>You will screw up; you will make mistakes – so when you do don’t be afraid to own up to them and take responsibility. Just because you made a mistake doesn’t mean you did it purposely and it certainly doesn’t make you stupid.</p>
<h2><b>Don’t cling to bad ideas</b></h2>
<p>You might have thought it was the right choice at the time, so to join your new love for owning up to your mistakes, don’t cling to decisions that didn’t work out. You might have chosen the way to go on wrong information, or things might have changed – doesn’t matter the reason, give it up.</p>
<h2><b>Get rid of half your friends</b></h2>
<p>Leave friendships that don’t bring you joy or expose you to negativity as quickly as you would a job or a partner. Don’t tolerate people just because you think you have to. All those people that you knew at school, if they are still around in 2 years, then they might be worth bothering with.</p>
<h2><b>No, you don’t love them</b></h2>
<p>Love isn’t what you think it is, stop using it out of context. You will know it soon enough.</p>
<h2><b>There are plenty of hours in the day</b></h2>
<p>Plan things, take advantage of everything available to you and don’t slack off. Your whole life will fly past in what seems like no time, but you have plenty of time to get things done.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>On June 3rd 2019 and with a little trepidation, I pushed the upgrade button Apple flashed before my eyes. I’d stayed up late to install the first beta of iOS13 and already knew I would regret it in some way. During the next couple of months, I would run into a whole host of bugs and crashes – but that was ok because I knew what I was doing and still wanted to use the update before it came out.</p>
<p>On stage Apple demoed the hotly anticipated Reminders upgrade, featuring lots of new features and a fresh new design. To do this, Apple had to ‘Upgrade’ my tasks for them to work, and I have to do the same on my other devices if I wanted them to work correctly. This was all displayed in front of me; I knew what I was doing.</p>
<p>So I dealt with Reminders not syncing to my Mac – I wasn’t planning to update my iMac as I rely on it for my livelihood – and I continued on my merry way. For the most part, iOS13 was stable enough for me to use and file the odd Radar. However now iOS13 has been released to the public, there are a massive amount of people that currently can’t access their reminder on Mac – with no way to ‘upgrade’ as Apple informed them they had to do.</p>
<p>We are now almost two weeks from iOS13 launching; we’ve already seen an update to 13.1, 13.1.1 and only yesterday 13.1.2. Still no sign of the Mac OS update, and no definite date of when it will come. So when Apple places a card in front of you saying you will need to upgrade your devices, what it also doesn’t say is there IS NO update for your mac.</p>
<p>The only hint of what is going on is a small section on <a href="http://apple.com/">Apple.com</a> when discussing iOS13 updates. Something that the vast amount of users are not going to see. I am sure the intention was to release the Catalina update alongside iOS13, but I am pretty sure Apple knew a long time ago that wasn’t going to be possible.</p>
<p>I knew what I was doing – most others did not. It’s on Apple to explain these things better. They let potentially millions of users upgrade their reminders with a half warning. I need reminders to work, don’t rush macOS out for me, but it’d be nice to get it pretty soon.</p>

<blockquote><p>A major differentiator since Apple’s earliest days has been interface design.

<p>There is a whole lot of weirdness in iOS13 and this is one of the strangest decisions in UI I have seen for a long time. When people that are reasonably proficient in using technology are convinced there is no way to forward an email you have a problem.</p>
<p>The button its self is not an issue, but the icon used is a lesson in hoe not to design an interface. It clearly implies reply and no further indication that another level of interaction exist beyond it.</p>

<p>I find Twitter quite meditative when done in the right way. Simply sit down a couple of times a day and just absorb the information. If there are other opinions expressed I might check out the full thread, however more often that not I just appreciate their point of view and scroll on by.</p>
<p>I don’t feel I can do this any more, I keep getting pulled into disagreements and I get huge amounts of negativity towards my tweets that after a while gets on top of me. Twitter isn’t discussion any more, it’s arguing and I don’t think I can bring it into my life. I think I’d rather have no interaction than be constantly tweeted at that their opinion matters more.</p>
<p>Mix in passive aggressive sub tweets and I think I’m pretty much at the point of no return. It’s hard enough to find some calm between all the attention seeking, and people building ‘their brand’. Twitter used to be such a great place to hang out. I think it still is but there is a way of expressing push back to people online, as there is in life, but the way Twitter seems to mould it needs to change.</p>
<p>I’m definitely not soft or a snowflake, or any other names people band about when others don’t like what they say. I’m 100% a proponent that people can have whatever opinion they choose, but they need to be expressed in the right way. I say this because I don’t think it is the way people are, just the way that it is encouraged on platforms such as Twitter.</p>

<blockquote><p>If I take on a new idea or habit, I do so because it has the potential to benefit my life. New ideas shape the future Me. Same goes for habits. Over time my ideas change, improve, and expand, and my current habits get replaced by new ones that continue to help me grow. Our readiness to jilt ideas or habits means we’re willing to grow—we’re willing to constantly pursue a better version of ourselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is exactly my feelings towards working on new projects and brining new things into my life too easily. Far too many times now I have gone too deep into things without enough thought and burnt myself out trying. Minimalism isn’t just about having less stuff, its about being intentional with everything you do.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>It’s hard for me to write about the differences between Android and iOS, and I struggle to comprehend how people go about it. So if you are looking for that kind of overview you are going to be disappointed, I simply wanted to talk through some thoughts I had in using the two operating systems without comparing apples to oranges. As time goes on it becomes apparent that both operating systems, although trying to achieve the same thing, are approaching it from different angles. This gives a stark contrast to those daring to switch between the two – something that has become increasingly harder.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Android, although pouring in digital wellbeing features, still seems insistent on bombarding you with notifications on everything you’ve ever Google searched. Indeed you can switch these off (ish) but it’s not easy to find nor understand. The fact still remains that Google make nothing from Android and hardly anything from Google Play, so they need to keep your attention somehow. My biggest concern with using Android has always been my privacy exchange, however in my honest opinion this is an issue the average user doesn’t care about nor understand. So for me to talk about this while discussing using the OS is moot.</p>
<p>Indeed Android is the more useful operating system, it makes it much easier to interact with notifications and find things you need instantly. Google was the trail blazer in giving users tools for free that typically cost money and monetising it in other ways – see Google Maps for an example. All of the stock software on both operating systems is there is make your life easier, and push you further into the eco system.</p>
<p>Apple may not be in the business on monetising your data, but the OS and all the free apps that go with it are there to pull you in so they can sell you other things. Services and subscriptions have become a focus for Apple in recent years, and this is evident now more than ever, pre installed Music and even now the AppStore itself with Apple Arcade, pushes you towards giving Apple money – just in a far more subtle way than Google.</p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>I am always fascinated by Android handsets, a huge selling point for Android is that it is far more exciting from a hardware perspective. You are guaranteed to find an handset that is suited to you use case however niche it might be. I chose to use a Note 10+ because I wanted something business like with a top camera, but there is a phone at almost every price point to suite almost everyone. Whereas you are stuck using whatever Apple design of it fits or not.</p>
<p>Should Apple go in a different direction to what you need from their hardware, you are stuck. A decision to move everything to another eco system and bare the pain of loosing apps and services (as well as the hassle of moving all of your data) is a truly live changing thing. Sure Apple charge a premium for making all the design decision for you, but what happens when you don’t agree?</p>
<p>In exchange for giving up control you get the best source of high quality, diverse and sometimes expensive software in existence. Apples App Store still trumps Google Play for quality of apps by a long chalk, although the standard on Android is much better than even a couple of years ago. Couple this with the pretty regular killing of Googles own services, there is always frustration when switching.</p>
<p>Apps from the same developer often work different, look different or are missing functions (even Googles) on Android. Which is a huge shame given the open nature of the platform. Sure you can ‘do anything’ with your device, but the quality of software to go with it is still lacking in broad terms – and this becomes apparent very quickly when switching.</p>
<p>The fact remains that my love of Android still runs deep into my heart but I feel much safer and better supported when popping my sim back into an iOS device. This of course is simply my opinion, you can use whatever you wish – Android is great.</p>

<p>I like to pretend I am often asked, but I’m not. I am seldom asked – but the fact remains that I am asked. Exactly how I do the things I do, how do I take part in podcasts, present a persona online and interact with people on a daily basis building a business. I enjoy the shocked faces from people when I reply, “I don’t really know”.</p>
<p>You might interact with me on a professional level, you might tweet at me online, or you might listen to one of my podcasts. Wherever it is that you interact with me, I am eternally grateful, but what you don’t see is the behind the scenes footage.</p>
<p>You might listen to the 3 hour podcast with an interesting guest, or hear me talk about Apple news on BYOD. What you don’t hear is the 45 minute pep talk I’ve had to give myself just to start that show. The excuses to run away and not bother doing anything, and the almost crippling imposter syndrome that I have.</p>
<p>I constantly have to battle with myself, not only because I’m <a href="https://gr36.com/im-an-outgoing-introvert/">actually an introvert</a>, but because I fear the reaction to everything I do. I want to create, I want to produce and I want to do more, but much of the time my mind just wont let me.</p>
<p>I get the impression I am not alone, but thankfully I am pretty good at talking to myself, and getting over the feelings of dread. It doesn’t stop everything that I do any more, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t affect me. My love of creating out-ways my constant self doubt. I have a motivation for life and doing things that make me happy, and I hope others find this themselves.</p>
<p>You see this is not a cry for help, more a motivational call to say that others feel the same. Be kinder to yourself my friends.</p>

<p>Almost two years on there is still a lot of scepticism around Face ID. For me it works fine, but others seem to have issues, or different use cases and struggle quite a bit. So either from inside information or shear hope, talk of Apple returning to Touch ID still exists. It’s hard to see Apple ‘backtracking’ because they see FaceID as the future, but perhaps the best way is to have multiple methods.</p>
<p>Since picking up the Note10+ it has become obvious to me that under screen finger print sensors are still a bit rubbish. Better ones exit, such as the OnePlus 7, but they are still a bit slow and unreliable. Implementation of them seems like a step backwards, but combine this with face unlock and the Note10 is the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Pick the device up and it looks for your face straight away, the face unlock is no where near as good as Face ID, but a large percentage of the time it’s unlocked before you realise it. Should this fail, then placing your finger on the screen is pretty easy for the few times it fails. In fact many times users are already touching the screen ready to use it, security features that fade into the background and stop being a consideration are the best designed.</p>
<p>The real solution could be slightly less stringent matching of both the finger and face combined, tolerances could be lower to make sure matches are easier, but combined together means much more secure system. A system that checks for multiple points is both secure and user friendly. Someone might know your PIN number, but iOS knows that it isn’t you so perhaps only allows access to certain parts of the OS.</p>
<p>Whats the odds of someone having a similar face and a very similar finger print? Even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/02/health/the-claim-identical-twins-have-identical-fingerprints.html">identical twins</a> don’t have the same finger prints, so no evil twin breaking into your phone any longer! Apple could then take things further with Apple Watch authentification, WiFi and Bluetooth options – the possibilities are endless.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>Although I have used an iPad pro with pencil for several years, it is always when using a Galaxy Note that I appreciate using a stylus. Samsungs S-Pen is the quintessential stylus, the phone that brought it back from the dead after being killed by Steve Jobs. The phone features a 6.8” display meaning touch interfaces are plenty large enough, but still manages to make a stylus useful.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, you soon realise that Samsung got something very right when introducing a stylus. When the original version hit the shelves, many people bought it solely for the screen size, but now when everything is that size and more prominent, users buy it for the stylus and Samsung hit it perfectly.</p>
<p>With each new version of the Galaxy Note seems to pack in new features to the tiny stylus, very few are actually useful. Potentially a camera button introduced with the Note9 might help in some situations, no one wants to use there stylus like a magic wand to swipe through photos or interact with the display.</p>
<p>The S-Pen not only gives you the option to handwrite things but by aiming at creatives Samsung have realised that a whole new interaction level can take place. I can now scrub through a video with my finger while trimming the start and finish down with the S-Pen. I have a much more accurate control on sliders or touching up small areas of a photo just by popping a pen out the bottom of my device.</p>
<p>The S-Pen is much more than a device for handwriting – although it is better at it now than ever – it is a whole different interaction level. Once I press the button and pull out the stylus, I have navigation and interaction options other phones don’t have with just touch. The real beauty also is I don’t have to use it or even see it when not in use, it isn’t stuck to the side of my device, it is just a click away.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When August rolls around it is my time of the year to switch to Android for a little while. It started as a stop gap to sell my iPhone and Apple Watch while the prices are still high and wait for the event, but now it is something I look forward to. For the last 2 years I have switched to a Galaxy Note, because like Matt Birchler, I like to keep my toe dipped into the water and see what Android is up to. This year more than others I am really starting to debate going back because the IPhone is poorly designed in comparison.</p>
<p>The Note 9 opened my eyes to what a big screened phone could be like to use when the company really cares about how you use it. Samsung slimmed the bezels and narrowed the screen to 18.5:9 making the whole handset feel a while lot smaller than it should. Even with a screen larger than any other iPhone it felt ergonomic and much more comfortable to use, something that further improved with the Note10.</p>
<p>This really starts to sting when you pick up an iPhone XS Max, a device that is smaller in physical size, but feels much larger due to how poorly designed it is. The team behind current generation iPhone design must place the way it feels in your hand bottom of the pile of concerns. The 5.5” screened device is admittedly light years ahead of the old ‘plus’ devices, but is simply a stretched iPhone XS. The XS Max is not only huge, but astonishingly heavy and cumbersome to hold.</p>
<p>In contrast when first holding the Note10+ I had to double check the model number twice, simply because it feels much smaller than it is. Sure the ‘infinity display’ helps, but its clear to see (and feel) that the team behind the design took time to think about how it felt in the hand. It’s glass front and back (and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/why-samsung-galaxy-note-10-needs-a-case" rel="noopener noreferrer">ridiculously slippy</a>), it’s packed full of battery and similar technology to the iPhone XS Max, so why does it feel so much nicer?</p>
<p>Perhaps because Samsung have been producing large screened phones the longest they have simply learnt from their mistakes. Yet I am always taken back to Apple adverts that point out how far your thumb can stretch, something they have put no thought into with modern devices. As another year brings another iPhone we look set to see the same design used again, same wider screen, same glass and metal and same feel in your hand.</p>
<p>This year I feel stuck more than ever (I know I said this <a href="https://gr36.com/finding-apple-escape-velocity/" rel="noopener noreferrer">last year too</a>), I’m starting to wish that it was easier for me to use Android long term, not only because the devices are more interesting but because there is more choice of devices. My choice of handset is based on being entrenched in an ecosystem and stuck with the lack of iPhone progress. There is an arrogance around Apple design now and I’m pretty sure Apple know you’re stuck so don’t even try.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>I’m new to drones, but decided to try one out to get some more interesting video and I’m glad I did. However because it is so new to me I didn’t really want to spend loads of cash on one if I wasn’t going to use it, so I decided to pick up a used<a href="https://www.dji.com/uk/spark"> DJI Spark</a> and DJI Spark controller one.</p>
<p>I managed to get a fly more kit with a few extras for a bargain price, but when it turned up I had issues connecting and paring. There wasn’t a whole load of information out there other than forum posts, but I managed to piece everything together and get it working again. Hopefully the guide will help you as well.</p>
<div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-grey">
<div class="kg-callout-emoji">💡</div>
<div class="kg-callout-text">Before you do this, its a good idea to plug the spark into DJI Assistant and check the firmware version and / or factory reset it.</div>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Hold down the power button on the DJI Spark for 9 seconds until you hear three beeps. Then do the same on the controller.</li>
<li>Power off both the DJI Spark and the DJI Spark controller.</li>
<li>Power on the DJI Spark controller and then hold down the pause, Fn and bottom right shoulder button (underneath the camera button) until you hear continuous beeping.</li>
<li>Power on the DJI Spark, then press and hold the power button until you hear one beep. Make sure your DJI Spark controller isn’t too far away from the DJI Spark. You will see the DJI Spark controller connect to the Spark and its lights turn green.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dont forget you need to WiFi connect to the controller (password is 12341234 for all remotes) and then open the DJI app. Hopefully you’ll be up and flying in no time.</p>

<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="powerbeats-pro-featured.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/53b47a4042.jpg" alt="Powerbeats pro featured" width="599" height="337" border="0" /></p>
<p>My biggest problem with headphones is that I have too many of them. Gone are the days of having one pair to last you years on end, If you can avoid the removal of your headphone jack you might last a while, but the reliance on Bluetooth brings better models ever to the market. Now owned by Apple, Beats are the masters of this, producing a never-ending stream of better models of each version of their headphones. The Powerbeats have seen little improvement other than the introduction on the W1 chip since launching in 2013. Six years later sees the most significant update to the line ever, incorporating a new Apple chip and making them truly wireless.</p>
<p>The Powerbeats Pro builds on the technology, and hopefully, the success of Apple own AirPods. Incorporating the security, convenience and power saving of the new H1 chip (signifier changed from W to H). Something that no other manufacturer has access to, nor has been able to complete with fully as yet.</p>
<p>The claim from Beats is that the Powerbeats are the most popular fitness headphone in the world. A bold claim, and arguably hard to prove – take a look next time you’re at the gym or out for a run, and you don’t see many of them. However, I am a massive fan, owning all versions to date.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="powerbeats-pro-phone-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/6994ba177b.jpg" alt="Powerbeats pro phone 1" width="1000" height="500" border="0" /></p>
<h2><strong>Usability</strong></h2>
<p>Upon unboxing the Powerbeats Pro, the surprisingly high build quality is evident. Often criticised for their use of plastic Beats haven’t changed their ways much, but the surface feels premium and worth the price tag. These are of course more than £200, and for that money you get almost double the battery, all be it in a comically large carry case.</p>
<p>Simply opening the case allows for quick paring to iOS and macOS devices, and once completed, the connection will sync to all your iCloud devices. Of course, you’ve heard all this before; we saw this on both generations of AirPods and older Beats headphones.</p>

<p>Where Powerbeats Pro stand out is usability that suits the fitnesses market perfectly. They seal well in the ear, and the ear hooks mean that you won’t have any issues with them moving around during even the most rigorous of exercise. If you’ve ever tried to run with wired headphones, you will know how freeing it is to have nothing flapping around or pulling on your ears. This new wave of genuinely wireless headphone is revolutionary to those that have spent many years having to run a cable down your top. Once you use these, you won’t be going back any time soon, and this alone is worth the price tag.</p>
<p>Sweat resistance is stated by Beats but only for the earbuds themselves. So don’t get caught in any downpours or spill anything on the case – this <em><em>is</em></em>surprising given how robustly they are made. Everything is all sealed off from the elements leaving just charging pins and buttons exposed. You read that right, not a touch interface or reliance on voice commands insight. Tactile buttons the same on each ear to change the volume and play/pause. You can also hold the centre <em><em>B</em></em> button down to activate Siri if you wish – but don’t forget with the W1 brings with it Hey Siri support.</p>
<p>She will hear you loud and clear for all your voice commands, but obviously, you’ll need a data connection to do this. I’ve been running phone free with a connection to my Apple Watch and even letting Siri read my incoming messages out for me. The microphone is surprisingly clear for the few calls I have taken on them while working out, but no reassurance that I was running was needed. It’s obvious you are on hands-free, but not distracting to the person you’re talking to, they are leaps and bounds ahead of the already pretty good Powerbeats3.</p>

<h2><strong>Sound</strong></h2>
<p>I want to say that these are the only headphones you will ever need, but if your ear is tuned to listen to the very best cans, you are going to have to compromise. They are never going to win any awards for sound quality given that most of the time in use you are moving around somewhat energetically. The sound is much improved over previous versions, with a tremendous dynamic range with a slight emphasis on bass.</p>
<p>They are a delight to listen to music and spoken word such as podcasts. Some downplay the sound of all Beats headphones, but the Powerbeats more than any other, I would argue they don’t need to sound perfect. However, the Powerbeats sound better than acceptable, much better than the previous version.</p>
<p>What I particularly like is that some sound from outside gets through despite the useful sealing tips. I’m not a fan of completely isolating headphones when exercising, being able to hear traffic and people around you is a must. The Powerbeats Pro also pause your music when you take one out your ear, which comes in especially useful when telling someone to re-rack their weights.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>This all detracts from the fact that these could, and should, be considered more than just workout headphones. They deserve much more than to be thrown into your gym bag or only used occasionally, they are real AirPod competitors. Both the sound and fit are much better than Apples own version, but they give up a little ground on the overall design.</p>
<p>I couldn’t ever see myself replacing my Airpods with these, but I won’t be wearing anything else for activities. I can’t state enough how much of a revelation running with no wires is. I have ears that won’t keep Airpods or indeed any other earbuds in, so Powerbeats are almost my only option. It’s rare I would recommend an upgrade on headphones even if you have the last version – but for everyone on the fence – you need these in your life.</p>
<p>The Beats PowerBeats Pro come in black, white, navy or green, costing <a href="https://amzn.to/31MMMLa">£219.95</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>The post will also forever be known as I’ve never given Apple notes enough of a chance and I bet you haven’t either. Despite two significant updates in recent years I’ve skirted around Apple notes usage, both for hand-written pencil ones and also writing things down, yet never used it entirely. There isn’t any good reason for this; many people use the stock notes app to the best of its abilities, it’s just never really ‘clicked’ – until now.</p>
<p>Notes are the cornerstone of my life, more so as I get older, I have to write stuff down rather than rely on my memory. I need to take meeting notes, I need to share information for my podcast, and I need to make shopping lists, so I don’t go hungry. When I add into this mix the fact I like to write a Journal and also write my blog posts, I end up with things spread all over the place.</p>
<p>If I can’t remember to buy food, I sure as hell won’t remember if I put my blog post idea in Ai Writer, Drafts or whatever cool app I’m using at this moment in time. You see I’ve skirted around all sorts of apps to do this with varying degrees of success (the closest was <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/bear/">Bear</a>), but nothing stuck. So I decided on all my requirements, and the Stock Apple Notes app was the most intimate. Using Apple Notes To Write In 2019.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Notes app, the stock iOS app isn’t ugly, but it won’t win any design awards. What it offers is rock-solid sync between devices (my two iMacs, iPad and iPhone) and a service I can trust to collect everything together with minimal fuss. Every time I think about my time with Evernote, I shudder a little, but Apple Notes offers what the vast majority of people need. I consider myself a power user, so some adaptations were required, and miser up becomes infantry more powerful when you take into account integration with Shortcuts and Siri. I didn’t want to go crazy as <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/ipad-diaries-optimizing-apple-notes/">some users have</a>, but if I am putting my life into one app, it needs to be useful.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Set-Up</strong></strong></h2>
<p>I like clear divides between my work and personal life, so the first step was creating areas for both of these things. Apple Notes makes it dead simple to have folders of notes and not allows them to be nested. Once I am in a folder, created notes go straight into that folder, and sync to all my devices within a minute or so. Meaning my created folders become sudo workspaces, a handy feature of more specific writing apps such as Drafts.</p>
<p>If I’m in work mode, I will only see work-related notes. This also become more helpful with iOS13 ability to open multiple notes in split-screen and move between them with ease.</p>
<p>Using Emoji in the folder names also makes these much easier to find, as does not having too many of them. You can make this as in-depth as you like, notes does allow sub-folders to be set up on iOS now and once done, they will sync across all devices – and show up in iCloud.com. Keeping everything organised does help with finding the information you’re looking for, but spotlight is often your friend.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Shortcuts &amp; Siri</strong></strong></h2>
<p>Recent updates to Shortcuts makes working with Apple Notes much more natural and dare I say it enjoyable to use. Shortcuts has the ability to search, list, append and show specific notes with a few taps. Or indeed voice commands, the joy of using a stock app is the access it has to features very few other apps do. Siri is a breeze to use with Apple Notes for capturing content and working with Shortcuts.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>All In?</strong></strong></h2>
<p>What I enjoy about using Apple Notes is the mature and familiar feel. It is simple and straight forward to understand and to use a tired old saying – it just works. Other apps out there feature fantastic publication features, tagging and all sorts of things – but I’m always stuck with a sync issue at some point, or a feature stops working for a little while. I have none of those fears with this setup.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are issues some times, but for the most part, Apple service is now trustworthy. With notes powerful features, integration with the OS and brand new dark mode, it’s hard to go anywhere else.</p>
<p>My only issue is publishing from the app, other apps have much better sharing features, so writing has another step in it. I’m hoping to build some more powerful Shortcut once iSO13 comes out and solve this issue. At the moment in time, I am only using Apple notes, and very happy that I have found my almost perfect setup.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2019/08/04/the-case-for.html"><h1 class="p-name">The Case For Native Apple Maps Reviews</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Ever noticed on Apple Maps that more and more reviews are appearing for places you want to visit? Since <a href="https://searchengineland.com/apple-maps-adds-new-review-sources-replacing-yelp-outside-us-in-many-cases-218020">2015</a> Apple has been pushing to make their stock mapping app much more useful for its users. Granted, it couldn’t have got much worse, but Apple realises the power in making your device more useful and engaging for their users.</p>
<p>Now comes the time they must open up and Maps, allow customers to make alterations much easier — and most importantly create reviews inside Apple Maps.</p>
<h2>For</h2>
<p>There are numerous social media posts and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/cjt733/can_we_talk_about_how_bad_the_yelp_integration_is/">Reddit threads</a> saying similar things. Reviews and photos of points on a map, doesn’t have to be a business, are one of the most helpful things available — after navigation, of course. It helps people find what they need and get a good idea of the experience if they visit.</p>
<p>Many a time I’ve searched on Google Maps for a park in the local area to take the kids and scrolled through the pictures to see what is there. This is times one hundred when looking for somewhere to eat, drink, or anything really, users need to know what this place is actually like. Downloading another app to do this just isn’t going to cut it.</p>
<p>There is also a massive disparity between review based on your country. The US still relies heavily on Yelp, while the UK leans on Trip Advisor, so it’s more challenging knowing where the data is coming from and how reliable it is. Apple must control this from start to finish (as they so love to do) and aid its users more by allowing all its customer base to review every point of interest in Apple Maps quickly. Offering a simple incentive to begin with when users upload pictures and reviews, similar to Google Local Guides, give Apple a tremendous kick-start and opens map reviews up to over a billion users.</p>
<p>Pulling this in from other places is one thing, but if you’ve ever known the pain of waiting for ordinance survey or any traditional service to even mark a new street on the maps is a horrible experience. All of a sudden you have a billion people updating and making the whole world for you.</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5136" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/9fb7a8ade0.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="921" />Against</h2>
<p>This is yet another thing for Apple to delve into and manage. With increasing criticism surrounding their foray into services and subscriptions, Apple is doomed if they do and damned if they don’t. Their insistence on controlling every aspect of their hardware and software from start to finish means that they often neglect users needs and also software stability.</p>
<p>Regardless of being managed by different teams, if attention is taken away from more critical areas, then a move into map reviews seems pointless. Google already found out the hardware that maintaining user-generated map changes and improvements can become untenable, and arguably the only reason them support maps is to sell adverts to companies. A business model that no longer interests Apple.</p>
<p>Pulling in data from <a href="https://searchengineland.com/apple-maps-adds-new-review-sources-replacing-yelp-outside-us-in-many-cases-218020">Trip Advisor</a> and services like <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/54.910/-3.432">OpenStreetMap</a> is the easiest way to gain masses of data with minimal investment or development. Policing reviews is a complicated process, one that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scammers-edit-google-maps-bank-listings-fraud-2018-11">Google has pulled back from</a>, so opening maps data up is not without its downsides. Do the server-side costs, review work and the general hassle make it worthwhile?</p>

      <p>Look, we need to talk. This is something that many of you are not going to like, it’s going to ruin your fancy home screen set up but it might actually save you money. You’re expecting too much from a new task manager, it won’t make you more productive.</p><p>Organisation and productivity comes from within, it’s not a superpower, but it’s not something lines of code can solve. Much like an exercise app won’t make you lose weight, a fancy task manager might be more helpful, it might make things easier for you to find but if you’re not using a stock app to its full potential you really don’t need to buy anything else.</p><blockquote>We are told this product or that gadget will solve our problems. That our next purchase will be the solution we’ve been looking for all along. — Joshua Becker</blockquote><p>The reason you want to keep switching, or buying a new version is understandable and is the result of a much larger issue. Much like Joshua Becker touches on above consumers expect far too much from their purchases. A task manager is a powerful tool to have, it helps tremendously to remember your tasks and also plan to get more done, but don’t expect it to transform your life and productivity.</p><p>Working on yourself and your internal drive is a much better area to place your energy into, not moving all your tasks into another app for the 4th time this month. Stop expecting quick fixes, if it was as easy as switching apps everyone would be productivity powerhouses. I know it’s the in thing to spend your time watching YouTube videos and worrying about the perfect set up, it doesn’t exist and you’re just stressing yourself out and wasting more time that could be better spent.</p>

<p>Like most people in the UK I spent Saturday at the beach, in fact, we went for the whole weekend. We had great fun, spending all day in the sand and the sea, and it improved my mental health. There is something very uplifting and calming about feeling the sand and smelling the sea air.</p>
<p>What was surprising was the number of people I observed spending more time taking photos than they did enjoying the situation. This isn’t a millennial thing either; it was a whole range of people from teenagers right the way through to those in their twilight years. All were posing in weird positions or waiting for certain things to happen to take photos and share them.</p>
<p>I don’t think these were for mementoes, the occasional selfie might have been, but most of those shots gave the impression they weren’t for themselves at all – they were for everyone else. Instead of enjoying the experience, a large percentage of people were looking at it through the lens of their camera, and when not doing that they were thinking about what pictures to take. On several occasions, the telltale “wait let me take a picture” can be heard while every little detail is caught on film.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This isn’t about taking photos, I take loads of them, in fact one of my favourite things to do is just wander around a park with my camera and look for photos to take. It’s about experiencing things fully and not taking yourself out of the moment. Record little clips of sporting events and concerts, but don’t watch the whole things through your camera screen. How on earth Glastonbury attendees managed to rack up <a href="https://newsroom.ee.co.uk/glastonbury-festival-2019-breaks-data-records/">100GB</a> of traffic is completely beyond me.</p>
<p>Memories live in your head, and last a whole long longer than your cloud storage solution to your bulging photo album.</p>

<p>I remember our first born like it was yesterday, it didn’t go smoothly though the pregnancy, she arrived a few days late, and we spent around a week in the hospital afterwards. But as soon as Lucie came into the world, all the stress of the preceding few weeks made it all worthwhile. She looked at me with her big brown eyes, and I wept as my world changed forever.</p>
<p>The next nine years have been even much harder in places. Years filled with hospital appointments, sleepless nights and bouts of deep depression for us both. However, all the pain we felt, all the stress we have had (and still to come), and all the deamons we have fought off have all been worth it.</p>
<p>I can’t imagine my life without a struggle in it. People often ask me how we cope with having a child with a complex disability – and I always answer precisely the same – we know no different. Despite us having another child who is ‘normal’ (although that’s a stretch some times), we have never known a life not filled with the tasks we now consider normal. Our life is dictated by our calendar, our meetings and fights for funding, but it’s filled with the most amount of love I have ever felt.</p>
<p>When I opened the door this morning with a little girl in toe she had no idea it was her birthday, yet she jumped up and down and shook with such excitement when she saw her presents and balloons it made it all worthwhile (even though it took me 2 hours to built a tent for her!). My life stresses me out, it makes me sad at points, and it exhausts me mentally and physically – but I love it. I love battling for my daughter to live as normal life as possible, and although I would give anything for her to be able to do more things, I wouldn’t change her for the world.</p>
<p>Thank you Lucie for teaching me more in your nine years with us than all the others combined. Thank you for making me a better person and giving me the best cuddles in the world.</p>
<p>I love you sweetie x.</p>

      <p>The iPad lifestyle is almost a badge of honour now, a marketing angle, or some might think it a calling. However the be all and end all is the constant need to jump up and down and shout about it is getting a little draining.</p><p>If you need to spend a significant amount of money working in an iPad when a Mac would do it for free, I really question if you are working on an iPad at all. I choose an iPad because I had one, it was far better than carrying a laptop and got things done easier and quicker. It was a mobile device and as such kept much of the interaction paradigm I wanted from a mobile phone. I have been working on an iPad for more than 5 years, but it doesn’t mean anything to my identity in technology circles or indeed any other circles. I do not feel the need to mention it at every waking moment like some kind of mantra.</p><p>Not because I don’t care about working on an iPad, but because I don’t care what you do. Choose the device that works best for your stuff. I don’t think the argument or even commentary needs to be made. I work on an iPad, you might not, but I don’t need to make it my life’s work to convince you.</p><p>If someone has published a post about the iPad, there is little need to give it space in your brain, no need to comment on it for the next week. Write a link post or passive aggressive tweet. Why even be bothered by it? Leave it be.</p><p>Evangelism is for causes that need shouting about. Points that need arguing and debating with.

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>For many weeks and months before WWDC I was worried. I had a fear for a piece of technology I have used for more than 5 years as my computer and it didn’t feel nice at all. My fears grew larger and larger the closer we got to the event, as leaks came out and people theorised what they wanted from the yearly software update cycle I hated it. I was really worried Apple were going to ruin my beloved iPad.</p>
<p>What makes the iPad so special to me is that it is first and foremost a mobile device. It is an extension of a simple OS, but one that is ridiculously powerful and evolving into a device to admire. I have been using an iPad every day since the iPad Air, and almost every update since has been transformative and made my life easier. Yet this year, more than any other, people were calling for a semi convergence – desktop class this and future of computing that, it all had me worried that the days of my iPad being my mobile computer were dying.</p>
<p>I couldn’t get excited for Springboard updates and multitasking overhauls because I could see a future in which iOS on the iPad was too complicated and at which point I would just go back to a Macbook. Everything that makes the iPad great is its roots in iOS, it’s touch first like the iPhone but powerful enough to take most of the heavy lifting of a macOS device without all the complexity that goes with it. Many people wanted all sorts of upgrades in iOS13 to make the iPad more of a computer but I was happy as it was, as I always had been.</p>
<p>I trusted Apple though. Trusted them to make the right decisions and land on a happy medium. I couldn’t get excited enough, or have the imagination to solve issues I pushed up against myself, but was confident that people smarter than myself knew what they were doing – and thankfully my trust was well founded.</p>
<p>With iOS13 my iPad Pro feels more like a computer than ever before, but still retains its iOS DNA. Sure Apple have renamed the operating system to iPadOS but this is in name only. It’s still a mobile operating system that almost everyone knows how to use, but by diversifying a little it’s now ok if swipes do different things. It’s acceptable for home screens and UI layouts to look different because its still quintessentially an iPad. It feels more computerish than ever but its the same device I fell in love with all those years ago. Bravo Apple.</p>

      <p>My wife often calls be “annoyingly positive” about everything, but that is not all I am. In fact some of my positive outlook and input is just for show, when in reality I am struggling. I know I really shouldn’t portray anything other than what I really feel, there is absolutely nothing wrong with not being ok. However I think a lot about the people around me and for one reason or another I don’t see why my internal mood should affect others around me.</p><p>I know from experience that my state of mind affects others around me to a huge extent. I react completely differently to very similar stimulus if I am struggling that day. I try not to let the <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/the-piggyback-guy/">piggy back guy</a> catch up with me most days, but even if I give in and let him ride every now and again, remembering a quote by Ram Dass usually gets me some of the way through.</p><blockquote>Be Like The Sun – Ram Dass</blockquote><p>I want to radiate to others my love and appreciation for them, even if they are testing me. I want to be like the sun and shine regardless of what the situation is, it shouldn’t matter if the clouds have gathered that day. The sun is always there, rising day after day. The natural thing when someone crosses you, or brings negativity into your life is to remove that sun shine. Remove the love and positivity and put that person in the shade for what they have done, but this only makes you both feel bad.</p><p>Be like the sun. Radiate out positivity regardless, and put no person or thing in the shade. Appreciate the challenge of overcoming the obstacle and make sure you still radiate, the sun manages to warm things even if something is in the way – so smile through it and it might just change everyone’s day.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>Did I ever mention how much I like writing in Bear? Pretty sure I did, but this latest update was possibly the best timing ever, it allows me to publish new blog posts really easy to WordPress.</p>
<h2 id="text-bundle"><strong><strong>Text Bundle</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The ‘magic’ behind this is exporting in text bundle. The updated app now exports plain text with attached images, and combines with the WordPress app to make sure the post shows correctly. In fact the Bear team built a whole <a href="https://github.com/shinyfrog/TextBundle">open source library for processing</a> so other apps could to the same in the future – as Shiney Frog point out open standards for sharing files <a href="https://blog.bear.app/2018/05/the-who-what-and-why-of-bear/">make them happy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to"><strong><strong>How To</strong></strong></h2>
<p>With today’s update to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880">WordPress for iOS</a> , you can now publish Bear notes to WordPress blogs. It’s really simple to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, make sure you update <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447">Bear</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880">WordPress</a></li>
<li>In Bear, tap the share sheet at the top right of a note</li>
<li>Tap WordPress in the top row of options (learn <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/install-app-extensions-iph1750a2241/ios">how to enable app extensions on iOS</a> )</li>
<li>The WordPress app will open. If you have multiple blogs, a screen will appear so you can pick one as your post’s destination</li>
<li>A draft screen will appear with your post filled in, complete with proper formatting of all headings, links, text styles, lists, and even photos</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: To give your blog post a title, make sure your Bear note begins with an H1 header tag.</p>
<p>There are a couple of major disadvantages to this set up. You must either have your blog hosted on WordPress web hosting or have the JetPack plugin installed. I have tried to find a way around this with my external site but it simply doesn’t pick up my site unless it is installed and activated.</p>
<p>Also there is no facility to add a featured image like other apps. For example Ulysses automatically sets the attached image as the featured image and this isn’t the case with Bear. You can of cause hop straight into the WordPress app and set this very easily.</p>

<p>Sharing previews are yet another thing missing from WordPress which should really be included by now. It’s dead easy to <a href="https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">install a plugin</a> and have it all done for you, but why bother with slowing down your site with needless plugins when you can add a tiny bit of code to your functions file.</p>
<pre><code>//Add Twitter Cards Meta Info
function add_twitter_card_info() {
 global $post;
 if ( !is_singular())
 return;
 echo ‘’;
 echo ‘’;
 echo ‘’;
 echo ‘’;
 echo ‘’; //optional: username of website
 echo ‘’; //optional: username of content creator
 if(!has_post_thumbnail( $post-&gt;ID )) { //use a default image if no featured image set
 $default_image=“http://example.com/image.jpg”; //replace this with a default image
 echo ‘’;
 }
 else{
 $thumbnail_src = wp_get_attachment_image_src( get_post_thumbnail_id( $post-&gt;ID ), ‘medium’ );
 echo ‘’;
 }
 echo “n”;
}
add_action( ‘wp_head’, ‘add_twitter_card_info’);
</code></pre>
<p>Simply paste in the above code to the functions.php file in your WordPress theme and validate all has gone correctly using the <a href="https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator">Card Validator</a>.</p>

<p>In my journey back to WordPress, there are lots of little modifications I need to make the website my own. One of which is the addition of micro and link posts.</p>
<p>I do not like all posts showing in the main RSS feed nor on the main index page of my blog. Many options and guides tell you to install plugins or add in code to your functions to exclude categories to all feeds. If you can avoid a plugin, then I would advise it, to prevent any unnecessary loading of your blog.</p>
<p>I did stumble on a solution to my requirements on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12918765/exclude-category-from-main-rss-feed-but-not-all-feeds">Stack Overflow</a> (where else), and this is detailed below.</p>
<pre>add_action(‘pre_get_posts’, ‘exclude_category’ ); function exclude_category( &amp;$wp_query ) // Exclude from loop, archive and feed but not from category page/feed { if( is_home() || ( is_feed() &amp;&amp; !is_category() ) || ( is_archive() &amp;&amp; !is_category() )) { // Exclude from home, feed, but not from category page/feed set_query_var(‘category__not_in’, array(120)); // Exclude category with ID 120 } }</pre>
<pre>Add this to your themes functions.php file and remember to change the (‘category__not_in’, array(120)</pre>
<p>to your desired category ID , if you need help finding that, check out <a href="https://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/find-wordpress-category-id/">this guide</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p>For the whole of this weekend, I turned my phone off. Not because it was bothering me, not because I was doing something important, but simply because I wanted to – and the world became a much quieter place.</p><p>I became fascinated by the silence that filled the gaps between us talking as a family, almost as if I didn’t want to spoil them. They became essential to me, they spoke to me, and I could feel what the silences were there to convey by just listening to them. Yes, I realise that sounds obscure, and I have re-written this post quite a few times already.</p><blockquote>We are fascinated by the words, but where we meet is in the silence behind them — Ram Dass</blockquote><p>Silence often fills us full of dread; when people are around us, silence becomes something to be avoided and talked over. Silence is a hugely important part of speech and conversation. It portrays emotion almost as much as the sounds in-between it, and when left alone, pulls more out of whoever chooses to break it.</p><p>It becomes far more critical when I am not in front of the person talking to me. When consuming audiobooks and podcasts, the spaces of silence are a crucial attribute. It has become the norm to listen to podcasts at obscene speeds and even get the app to remove silence as if it is something to be avoided. It is treated as dead ‘air time’ that serves no purpose, and thankfully I will never edit it out of my own.</p><p>Breaking the silence of a room should become a choice; the reason for speaking is more important than the enjoyment of the quietness. Don’t speak because you are uncomfortable with the silence, become comfortable with the quiet instead.</p>

<p>For the first 30 years of my life, I thought I was different from everyone else. I felt that my shifts in mood and outlook on life were abnormal and no one else felt like I did. I seemed strange to me that my happiness and motivation through the daily grind of life was more like a rollercoaster than it really should be. Wasn’t until the last few years that I learnt that everyone is the same, and these changes are what makes life so fulfilling.</p>
<p>Imagine a video game, how rubbish would it be if every level was easy to complete. You might start playing and enjoy it at first, but very soon the boredom would set in as the rewards became less fulfilling. Overcoming increases in difficulty and learning new skills because it keeps you hooked, and once you beat that last level the reward feels so much sweeter than if it were a walk in the park.</p>
<blockquote><p>if you know the way broadly you will see it in all things – Miyamoto Musashi</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, getting that balance right is critical, cranking up the difficulty level at just the right times and places is vital. Too steep a jump and it becomes too much, and you’re likely to quit. However how more likely are you to stop than the straightforward version? The easy way out seems much more appealing but leaves a slightly hollow feeling.</p>
<p>As friends and family members go through their struggle with mental health the most abundant response is that of medication. Prescribing a pill that takes the world and blunts the sharp ends for you. Removes the stresses to a level that you don’t care. Making an average life filled with days that are all different when graded from 1-10, and makes them all a 5. I’m never convinced this is the best resolution, when just understanding their feelings are healthy may be the most straightforward option.</p>
<p>I am not advocating that people shouldn’t take medication that is needed, and please don’t take this as a post to try and say that. When prescribed a drug it is vital you take it, but the self-medication is far more dangerous. This may be with drugs or alcohol, but it may be simply removing yourself from the world. Shying away every time your life is tough and just not exposing yourself to the daily stresses and strains that make you stronger. Escaping the world when it gets too harsh, or painting a different outcome on social media is a far more dangerous way of evening out the world.</p>
<p>Creating my struggle is now something that I embrace and even welcome once it comes. When I’m struggling through hard times in the gym, or life, it makes the better times much better. I know the outcome I want to achieve and remember the fact that I have been there before to experience this wave breaking. Comfortable in the knowledge that I have learnt more from the days that we’re closer to breaking than those pitched in the middle. I thought at times my whole world had ended, but now look back and smile because I came through.</p>
<p>I can’t imagine a world that is made up I only 5s; it sounds like the most boring life in the world.</p>

  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>I’ve had this post in my drafts for a long time because from both an internal and an external perspective it is something that bothers me tremendously. I have rewritten it so many times to try and avoid the negativity, and I hope this comes across in the right way.</p>
<p>More than a few times in my life I have fallen foul of letting my ego get the better of me, this hasn’t been lately but indeed is something I catch myself doing. Unfortunately, I am not alone, and social media seems to support these ego expansions, and you receive little push back.</p>
<p>Time and time again I see the over inflation of ego because they receive a little notoriety, receive a few followers that fluff this up and very quickly it gets out of control. They begin to forget the people that are around them and are removed to place they look down.</p>
<p>As I said before, this has happened to me, <a href="https://gr36.me/2019/02/08/132521.html">on a much smaller scale</a>, but I see it more as we are more connected. When I think back to the person I was even a few years ago, I would have never written a post such as this, but I am confident now that I have learnt many lessons to pass them on.</p>
<p>The ego is such a dangerous part of our consciousness that it seems to work against us as a person and as a community. Don’t let it take over you and remember who you are, what you stand for and everything you wish to be. From experience we should all try and remember that our opinions do not matter more than others; you can learn from each one of your interactions, and be humble at all times.</p>

<p>You might be wondering this, or you may not care (or even noticed) but I have been very absent from my usual haunts recently. This is partly by choice, and partly due to other reasons. I am, well I think I was, burnt out – but during my break away I have realised that the things I thought were important to me as a person, actually are not.</p>
<p>I came to a huge realisation. I thought it was social media that I loved, but I hate it. It’s the conversations I like, and they are becoming less and less. No one knows how to have a discussion any longer, and the technology circles I used to move in are no longer attractive. Interaction has died both back to my posts, and also from my end. I just can’t be bothered to respond because of passive aggressiveness or merely being ignored.</p>
<p>Quite frankly I feel it is no longer worth my time. That is not to say that engaging with my followers is no longer worthwhile; I’m not that arrogant. It is that time put in no longer equals value out, and at many points, it is detracting from my life and mental wellbeing. Lots of the people I looked up to as inspiration and motivation are not the types of person I want to be. I’m not interested in building a brand for myself, I want to be able to be myself, and that doesn’t revolve around the things it used to.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of my working life now designing, writing and working on things I used to be in my spare time. So when home time comes, I want to do different things. I feel like a different person now, with different desires, different motivations and a new outlook to life. I feel as though I’ve gone to a different stage in my life, so if in any doubt – that’s where I am.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>When the rumours first started hinting at Apple working on a smartwatch, I was already sold. My wrist had already had an Android wear watch strapped to it, but since my switch to Apple products, my pebble watch although great wasn’t cutting it. Now four years later, it is the single bit of hardware that keeps me using an iPhone – but man is it ugly.</p>
<p>You see I have a bit of a thing for watches, in fact before smartwatches became a real option I had around 15 different ones in my possession, but the Apple Watch ruined all my style, due to its notification and health monitoring. It’s not ugly in terms of a smartwatch, although not <a href="https://www.mobvoi.com/uk">the most beautiful looking</a>, but its dam ugly when compared to most regular watches. Take the Apple Watch out of a fitness environment, and it sticks out like a sore thumb. Although the Apple Watch is becoming more acceptable in business meetings and formal situations, it just needs something more.</p>
<p>The ridiculous price tagged editions or making them out of expensive materials isn’t the answer, but the design is. Given Apple’s insistence on complicating product lineups in recent years, is it time for different shapes and an iPhone X type shift. A model that is higher priced, but a glimpse at improved design and specification. The time has come to move away from a squircle – it’s uncomfortable, ugly and looks out of place unless your colleague has a Samsung gear watch.</p>
<p>I have never seen a wrist that the watch fits comfortably on at all times, I don’t feel it often myself, but each time I see a picture of anyone wearing one it is ways poking away from their arm at a weird angle. As much as a round shape doesn’t fit as much information onto, at least it looks like it belongs on your wrist as long as you get the design right.</p>
<p>It is a good job the Apple Watch has become so ingrained in my life because I still loathe putting it on. The sad reality is I couldn’t live without it, my phone never makes a noise any longer, because only the essential things tap me on the wrist and let me see if I need to give my phone any attention. I’m still longing for a better watch to look at. The best looking and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17820290/apple-watch-sales-idc-report-best-selling-smartwatch-wearable-market">most popular smart watch</a> shouldn’t be the pinnacle, Apple needs to aim for the best-looking watch.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I’m not sure if you’re aware of this, but I use a lot of Apple products. I understand this might come as a shock, but quite a few years ago I decided it was the best option for me to lean in and get the benefits of living solely in the Apple garden. I’ve dipped my toe in and used several other devices, but for the most part, it hasn’t been worthwhile. However, for the last few days, I have been considering vaulting those walls and running away because I have a real fear they are getting too high.</p>
<p>The recent Apple services event went down as perhaps the most boring of all time, and possibly one of the cheapest I’ve ever watched. None of the new products interest me, and even if they did, they won’t be launched outside the US any time soon. What they did do is spread an overwhelming fear through my soul, sole for the fact I am scared of becoming trapped.</p>
<p>Much like the ever-growing pay scale in a corporate job, Apple keeps ramping up the barriers to leaving and afraid one day I’m going to have a breakdown in my corner office. Sure I don’t HAVE to use Apple news, but when followers share links to things they have read I can’t read them without the Apple News app. I don’t have to read the magazines, or indeed watch the TV shows, but it’s pitched as though I’d be stupid not too. – and then the screws start to turn.</p>
<p>TV and reading the news turns into another Apple Music or Airpods. Sure there <em><em>are</em></em>competing platforms, but they can’t even stand up against the wall due to Apple kneecapping them with access to Siri, in-app payment taxes and in the case of headphones, <a href="/2018-03-24-the-w1-conundrum/">proprietary hardware</a>. Nothing changes in the immediate, but much like <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/apple-app-store-spotify">Spotify now feels</a>, the same will come of all other services available to your Apple hardware. Play the game the Apple way or lose, badly.</p>
<p>This feeling is without a doubt on its way toward the user base. Why would you want to pay anyone else for service whey Apple provide it all? ‘We wouldn’t go as far as to call you stupid, but people that buy our stuff are <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/07/09/researchers-claim-iphone-and-ipad-ownership-is-a-wealth-indicator">rich in case you don’t you know</a>.’</p>
<p>What’s worse is that you can’t even take these things with you, so indeed you can give up a handset or laptop that has its faults and get something arguably better. Yet none of the content is transferable; this lock-in feeling is growing to dread. Could there be a future where escape is impossible, finding the <a href="/2018/10/12/finding-apple-escape.html">right velocity</a> is still possible, but we are moving very fast towards a time that it isn’t – and that should scare you.</p>

      <p>Not in that way! I’ve never been happy with the way my blog performs, or looks, and unfortunately I spend too much time tweaking things and even creating completely new ones! This is time I should be spending doing other things, or you know, actually writing things to publish on my blog.</p><p>So the time has come to make something and stick to it, I’m currently debating over a few different options – and I’ve managed to narrow it down to three options. I either move all of my content onto a hosted micro blog, publish everything on a redesigned Jekyll blog or use <a href="https://blot.im/">blot.im</a>.</p><p>Blot really appeals to me because I can just stick a markdown file in a Dropbox folder and let it work its magic. It’s quick and easy, minimal fee (£20 a year) and very minimal fuss. The downside of this is the themes are limited, and I’m struggling to get my head around editing it into something I’m happy with. My worry is that its a little slower than my Jekyll affair, and I think I will edit the design too much.</p><p>Jekyll is easy for me to work with, has zero cost (outside of a domain) and there are loads of themes and a wealth of knowledge out there on the internet. The downside is that it requires a bit more preparation to get a theme to where I want it to be, and a little more work in publishing (pushing to Github). This is pretty easy on iPad, but a little more annoying on Mac (but not impossible).</p><p>Micro.blog has appealed to me for a long time, and it has almost infinite support for custom Hugo themes. However I am still not sure if I want all my short and long posts appearing together? As I have spoken about before, I am still struggling to admit I’m never going to be a writer. I publish completely different things on my <a href="https://gr36.me/">micro.blog</a>, to on my <a href="https://gr36.com/">main blog</a> – but in all honesty there is no reason this needs to continue.</p><p>I’m also a little nostalgic over my creaky old Jekyll theme, it is the only one I’ve used and I’ve modified it so much I think I could rebuild it in my sleep!</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I often day dream about the perfect future of pretty basic products. This often leads to some strange outcomes and random doodles but lately I have been thinking through the future of targeted advertising and I’m a little worried.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong my ideal future for being tracked around the internet, and also real life, is for it to be killed off. However there is clearly a future for them, so what is the logical best product they could produce. Simply speaking, the idea of this technology is to get so good it predicts products and services you need <em><em>exactly</em></em> when you need them. So presumably the apex product is one that every advert shown results in a sale.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ten, fifteen years from now the world will be nothing like what we remember, nothing much like what we experience now, we will be swimming in impulses and data—the microchip will make us offers that will be very hard to refuse. – <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/02/08/reading-in-the-age-of-constant-distraction/">Sven Birkerts</a>, The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age</p></blockquote>
<p>The algorithm gets to a stage where it is so good, it can predict everything about you and the events of your life, that each advert pitched to you is perfect. This sounds both perfect and a nightmare, depending on your opinions on consumerism, but first consider that advertisers are recording your <a href="https://medium.com/@thomashillhouse/three-reasons-the-facebook-cambridge-analytica-data-breach-is-different-ef5c9ca5b99a">gullibility</a> and also how much influence you may have over others. So if life is indeed heading for one filled full of impulses and data driven experiences, the data collected and targeted suggests something very wrong indeed.</p>
<p>So don’t be confused in thinking this is a future a long time from now, movement into this reality is going at a staggering pace. What’s the worst that could happen from this? We buy a few products that don’t turn out to be all the great and move on. Indeed a few lost pounds, or a bit of annoyance returning a product is one thing, but consider if it’s not a product you are selling at all. It could be an idea, or a political opinion being pushed instead of a pair of jeans.</p>
<p>That Facebook friend you hardly know who shared that fake news story? It may not be an accident of your friend’s gullibility; that friend could have been specifically targeted with a fake news story using personality and network information like that found in the Facebook / Cambridge Analytica data breach. – <a href="https://medium.com/@thomashillhouse/three-reasons-the-facebook-cambridge-analytica-data-breach-is-different-ef5c9ca5b99a">Tom Hillhouse</a></p>
<p>This reality is happening right now, targeting adverts and also data brokers are allowing their systems to pitch ideas and beliefs to people, and you don’t have to delve too deep to realise how <a href="https://www.referendumanalysis.eu/eu-referendum-analysis-2016/section-7-social-media/impact-of-social-media-on-the-outcome-of-the-eu-referendum/">bad this could end</a>. If these same algorithms and systems get so good they can sell you anything, including swaying your votes we are in real trouble.</p>
<p>So when people are perfectly fine with <a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44686">Google</a> (and others) collecting all of their data because they don’t mind seeing better ads I shudder a little. This runs much deeper than buying more stuff, in the not too distant future it could be changing your beliefs.</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2019/03/20/overstretching-to-upgrade.html"><h1 class="p-name">Over-Stretching To Upgrade</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>One of the most difficult urges I struggle to let go of is my desire for stuff. To buy things just because I can, and upgrade to the latest and greatest simply because it was released. Thankful this pang is getting less and less, but there is an over arching trend of commercialism to push the latest update onto people and cause many of them to over extended their budgets to make this purchase.</p>
<p>So when Apple semi-secretly updated their product ranges with new iPads, they gave a much better line up. Now you can get 75% of an iPad Pro experience for a fraction of the price. A base model iPad Air, with keyboard and pencil will now set you back £727 which is cheaper than just purchasing an iPad Pro on its own. If you wanted a compatible set up for an 11” iPad Pro it grows to a wallet busting £1067.</p>
<p>Does the iPad Pro provide a more than 30% better experience? Unfortunately there is no answer to this question, that would be unique to your use case, but its now worth thinking about. Sure there <em><em>are</em></em> differences, but how much of a difference to stop users from over paying to achieve a similar result? Apple will consider this in terms of limiting sales of the iPad Pro, but will users see this as a worthy purchase?</p>
<p>This question is more obvious when you consider the upgrade cycle of mobile phones. Information suggests that people are holding off <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/30/iphone-upgrades/">upgrading as often</a>, that is perhaps due to the increase in prices, and some argue it is lack of innovation. However there are still a huge amount of people overstretching to upgrade to the newest handset. Top tier handsets are now hovering around £1000, meaning that the norm in the UK has become 3 year payment plans to make upgrades more cost effective – yet still more than <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/766888/martin-lewis-money-show-mobile-phone-contract">double the average contract</a> cost from 2014.</p>
<p>As shown above when Apple launched the iPhone XS, the iPhone 7 is available for less than half the price. Many users would be hard pressed to find the iPhone XS to be 100% better than the iPhone 7, I say this is a person with an iPhone XS sat on my desk, from a place of privilege. I am also a person that now questions why I even bothered to upgrade. My, as well as many other peoples, urge to upgrade was one to keep up with the times. There are a few things I really desired (such as dual sim) but for the most part my desire to purchase came from my ego. I get very little extra benefit over the iPhone X that was sat here only a few months ago, and given the chance again I would not splash out.</p>

</figure>
<p>When brands make a range of products available at every price point, it is considered a grab for money. A play to make sure everyone can afford to buy something new. This may be the case, but it also opens up a much better reason not to over extend the budget, providing they are marketed in the correct way. The iPad Air may not be 30% worse, but it saves people 30% of their money, there is <a href="https://gr36.com/2019-03-17-your-tech-investment/">less and less reason</a> to upgrade outside your budget now – and that’s a great thing.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>For many years there were apparent differences between the technology we bought. Clear divides between what companies were and were not able to produce, the laptop market was still as it is now, but in mobile some phones sucked, and other prevailed. A tech world was a sea of constant compromises as brands valued different things in their TVs, computers and even headphones.</p>
<p>Now, more than ever, everything is the same. Sure there are a few items which are considered ‘the best’, but in almost all price points and markets, most things are pretty much created equal. Gone are the days of being able to answer an enquiry of what laptop to buy with “just get a MacBook Air”.</p>
<p>So how exactly do people wade through a world this complicated? It’s a huge task, but it is now absolutely vital that users start to choose items based on the ethics and values that a company holds.</p>
<blockquote><p>Before you dive into any new doodah, consider a company’s ethics, morals, branding and messaging. If you aren’t comfortable, look to alternatives. – <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/technology/how-to-survive-the-next-era-of-tech-slow-down-and-be-mindful.html">Farhad Manjoo</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Sure you can pick up a de-humidifier or Bluetooth speaker for a fraction of the price from a small Chinese brand that may disappear tomorrow. We as users have no idea where they come from, how it is made or indeed who the profit is going to. Apple can and should be held up if the production lines don’t provide adequate conditions, but can all companies? Do you know what your investment is funding, where the item came from and what went into it? Are you comfortable to the investment the workers put into it in exchange for what you will get out of it?</p>
<p>All of these questions are almost impossible to answer completely, but the real issue is how many people out there don’t care. Consumers are told to focus on what the device can do, and how much better it is than the last one instead of what the real value of the device is. This device might be cost-effective to you, or it might just be the best thing on the market, but what went into making it? Are you paying for it in other ways, or are other people paying for it in the worst way possible?</p>
<p>This is without taking into account the amount of personal data we give up to brands we have never heard of. Millions attach cheap home automation gadgets to their home WiFi with no thought of what it may be doing with all the data flowing through it. When are even leading phone brands such as OnePlus <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/340174/its-time-to-stop-buying-phones-from-oneplus/">found to be doing things more than a little bit shady</a>, who do you complain to if the same is found in your smart lightbulbs?</p>
<p>Consider also the services you use. Google has long provided a suite of apps that are often free and extremely powerful. With the trade-off that your data is collected and used to show you adverts. If this trade-off doesn’t vibe with you, there are a wealth of others out there to choose from. This is a huge positive to the end-user because being able to pick and choose where you place your allegiance is import not just for you but for the future.</p>
<p>As Fahad digs into above, where you place your purchase affects others. End-users must start to make firm decisions if the companies values don’t align with their own. We are in a world where most things are pretty much equal but still dominated by 3 or 4 huge corporations. If you don’t think a company is doing an excellent job with your data, your TV experience or your selfies, by all means, vote with your wallet and switch! However, consider who you want to give your money to and what it is funding. Who is paying for this investment?</p>

      <a href="http://localhost:1313/2019/03/03/how-to-use.html"><h1 class="p-name">How To Use Rodecaster Pro Multi Track With Audio Hijack</h1></a>
    
  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>It has only been a few days since <a href="/2019-03-03-rodecaster-update/">Rode updated</a> its Rodecaster Pro to utilise Muti track but it has already proved to be a brilliant upgrade. The ability to output upto 14 tracks simultaneously for post editing is quite frankly a ridiculous feat, but may take a little time to get your head around.</p>
<p>Here’s how to take advantage of the update and record using Audio Hijack – which is my <a href="https://gr36.com/gear/">podcast recording software</a> of choice.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Understand The Update</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The 1.1.0 update is pretty easy <a href="/2019-03-03-rodecaster-update/">to install</a>, but might take a little while to understand what exactly has been changed. Once the update is completed, disconnect and reconnect the USB-C cable to allow your computer to recognise a new connected device. Your Mac will now register two devices instead of one. RodeCaster Pro Stereo and also RodeCaster Pro Multitrack.</p>
<p>The connected USB-C cable now outputs 14 separate audio tracks to your Mac which apps such as Audio Hijack can record individually or mix together. The below image shows you the channel numbers for each output.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Set Up Audio Hijack</strong></strong></h2>
<p>To get started and understand what is going on the best way may be to start with a blank session, just to make sure you don’t alter any bespoke sessions you already have set up. Drag in an input device block, double click on the block and you will notice the RodeCaster Pro Multitrack device in the menu. Once you select this, more options will appear when you uncover the advanced tab underneath.</p>
<p>These are numbered 1 to 14 according to the layout detailed above. You keep a stereo output of the ‘master track’ (1&amp;2) but also mono outputs for Mic 1 (3), 2 (4), 3 (5) and 4 (6), as well as stereo for the USB input (7&amp;8), TRRS phone connector (9&amp;10), Bluetooth input (11&amp;12), and also the sound pads (13&amp;14).</p>
<p>A drop down menu under the left and right channels will unveil all of the available tracks, which you can select to your desired outcome. In my set up underneath I record over Skype with just one other person, meaning my set up is pretty straight forward. However now that 14 tracks are available you can create something really unique to your podcast.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Create Your Set Up</strong></strong></h2>
<p>Your usecase will vary, but in my session for <a href="https://byodpodcast.com/">BYOD</a> shown below I have my microphone connected to input 1 (track 3) and also the Skype audio (track 7) going into one input block. This then splits into two duplicate blocks, so I can record two separate mp3 files of just my audio and just Nati separately.</p>
<p>In between the duplicate block and the recorder I also have a meter block, just so I can check audio is being recorded correctly, and then into my audio recorder I also have the sound board (track 13) recored to grab any sound I play into the episode.</p>
<p>I could of course make this much more complicated, and record each individual block, or turn things on and off as I wish, however I like a much more simple set up that can be added onto if desired. This software update has already made my editing much easier and allows me to spend much less time worrying about recording.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>For as long as I’ve been using <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-02-19-one-year-ipad-computer/">an iPad as my computer</a> I’ve used it because it was the most portable option I could find. I’ve hovered around the 10” mark since there were options in size <sup><a href="https://gr36.com/moving-to-the-bigger-ipad/1">1</a></sup> and been perfectly happy doing so. It gave me a screen big enough do what I needed on the go and could also be used to relax and read my Pocket feed. I partly blame it on <a href="https://darylbaxter.com/">Daryl Baxter</a>, but I’ve upgraded to the 12.9 – and in true clickbait style – here’s why.</p>
<p>I’ve used the 12.9” version before, in fact it was my first iPad Pro – but it only lasted a couple of days before being returned. It was simply too large to me to carry around, and didn’t offer me enough value to pot up with the extra bulk. It was brilliant to use on a desk, but <em><em>much</em></em> worse everywhere else, so it was quickly returned and I waited for the 9.7”.</p>
<p>The other ‘smaller’ models followed and I leaned into the iPad lifestyle more and more as things got easier and easier. A screen of around 10 inches is absolutely fine, but of course if you need to get things done a larger screen is nearly always better. However I was very much of the opinion that if I am travelling with the added weight and bulk of a 12.9 screen, I might as well take a MacBook.</p>
<p>Thats is of course until this new version. It’s old news now, but the new version is considerably smaller and lighter than the last one. It feels much the same when in use than my old 11”, and fits into most ‘tablet pockets’ in bags. That is not to say it isn’t heavier and larger than the smaller version I am used to. My technique of using the device seated and reading articles has changed, and as a strange by product of this I use my iPad much more like a laptop than ever. I have even caught myself several times typing out posts on the software keyboard – shock horror!</p>
<p>So there are definitely compromises to make and a smaller version is going to be the better option for most people, but this version is finally at a stage that these issues do not negate the improvement of having a larger screen. I am so happy I was talked into it, and you <em><em>might</em></em> be too.</p>

  </div>
  <section class="e-content post-body">
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><!--kg-card-begin: html--></p>
<p>There is a tendency amongst the people I follow on Twitter, and converse with online to get defensive. If you buy a certain product, or talk about a particular thing you are then forever labeled. Expected to defend or comment on everything that happens in that space, and quite often passively mocked. I use Apple products, I more or less like what they produce – but I couldn’t care less what they do as a company.</p>
<p>I’ve said this a few times, most recently of which on <a href="https://www.byodpodcast.com/episodes/episode-81-unapologetically-meh/31/12/2018">last weeks BYOD podcast</a> – but I am unapologetically uninterested in half the ‘news’ surrounding the company. Just because I buy technology equipment from a certain company, purely because it fits my needs, does not mean I give a damn about anything else. If the company folds tomorrow, it might cause me a minor inconvenience, but I really wont care in the slightest.</p>
<p>Why should I care that Apple achieves a certain revenue, or equally that they are doomed because some person on Twitter says so. I am focused on what a difference the products make to my life, what they do for others, and what I can do to help people get the most from their device. I am not bothered how many iPhones sell in China (or anywhere) all I care about is if <em>I</em> buy one or not.</p>
<p>It’s exciting to talk about upcoming products, speculate on rumours about features, or even joke about software bugs – but when it comes to the rest of the noise all I can do is shrug.</p>
<p>Today, here and now, I am making a stand to avoid all talk about sales figures, share prices and all the other stuff that goes with it. I am focused on talking technology and what I does for me (and the world) and the positives surrounding various different products.</p>

<p>Whilst spending far too long redesigning this blog, I’ve come to the conclusion that it look fine the way it is and I couldn’t be bothered with a huge change. So instead I’ve been looking into changing some of the small things. Many of these were pretty easy, but my biggest one was the styling of footnotes.</p>
<p>Whilst trying to get to the bottom of exactly how I change the styling, there wasn’t a great deal of help out there to help. Information on the CSS related to Footnotes is quite confusing. Much of it was out dated and didn’t really apply when using a Jekyll blog. I managed to find a few bits of info and do a bit of testing and it turns out it’s pretty easy to do.</p>
<h2>Jekyll Stuff</h2>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to default to the markdown variation Kramdown. This already has footnotes built into it and displays them at the end of the article content. The vast majority of Jekyll blogs out there already use Kramdown, so you might not have to do anything, to check just have a look for <code>markdown: kramdown</code> in your <code>_config.ymal</code> file.</p>
<h2>The CSS Stuff</h2>
<p>This is where most of the information falls down, many resources will tell you to mess around and create a class for your footnotes so you can style this in CSS. That might be the case using WordPress or HTML but Kramdown presents it all neatly in HTML for you to style. There are two different parts you are able to change if desired.</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial footnote that appears in the article contents, in your sites CSS this is the <code>.footnote</code>.</li>
<li>The text showing information at the bottom is a serrate entity. This is what most people refer to as the citation, and this is styled using <code>.footnotes</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is pretty easy to get these confused but dead simple to style them both individually. All of the links and notes adopt the formatting of your regular content, but I wanted the footnotes to appear closer together and also in slightly smaller fonts as they do in academic papers. I also chose to add in some brackets around the footnote (a la Wikipedia) to highlight them a little more. My CSS snippet is as follows.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code>footnotes {
 font-size: 14px;
 margin: –10px 20px;
}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>.footnotes p {
 margin: 10px;
}</p>
<p>a.footnote:before {
 content: “[”;
}</p>
<p>a.footnote:after {
 content: “]”;
}</p>
<p>You can of course customise until your heart is content. This might seem pretty obvious to those in the the know, but I struggled to find any conclusive information easily. Hopefully this helps a little, I am still learning myself so wanted to put some information out there to try to help others.</p>

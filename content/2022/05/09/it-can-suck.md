It doesn’t take a lot to see how frustrating some people can be. Here I was in a happy little bubble and thinking the world was getting better and twitter was an OK place to be again.. and then [Doctor Who was announced as a Black man](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/08/doctor-who-ncuti-gatwas-irrepressible-rise-to-new-time-lord)

I am still not convinced that most of the outrage and general bigoted tweets are real. Much like flat earth, I think there is an in-joke I just don’t get. Or perhaps this is my minds defence mechanism for convincing myself that the world really isn’t as bad as it seems? This is all got to be just for attention, or internet points or something right?

Anyway, my good mood continues, but perhaps my positiveness towards social media does not.

Like everyone else that uses LinkedIn I get the occasional notification on jobs we think you might be interested in. I am not, but I always have a look anyway to see what’s out there.

The list just now was pretty long, and contained some high profile names looking for new talent. However it took me until the 12th listing to see one with a salary outlined! It only got worse form then on, because it was the only one of 42 jobs that told me how much the alert would be.

Weird that we are still hiding the numbers and seeing what talent we can get and only showing our hand at the last possible moment.

Many is not the only thing that matters, but its pretty important given the current climate don’t you think.

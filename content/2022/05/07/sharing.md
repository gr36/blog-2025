About an hour ago, I decided I was going to sign up for a year of micro.blog and [start sharing more things](https://twitter.com/gr36/status/1519652342257303552?s=21&t=F3PIAUwtfLJcUg4EdriRsg). I’d just finished the 7th day straight on using our home cross trainer as part of our [monthly challenge](https://twitter.com/gr36/status/1519995151191613440?s=21&t=F3PIAUwtfLJcUg4EdriRsg) and wanted to write something. These kinds of posts would really fit into my blog, and decided somewhere else might be better—but then it hit me just how stupid that was.

What exactly was I wanting to write a post for? To show how great I am, but not let it interfere with this illusion that my blog is somehow professional? I have no idea, to be honest.

But then again, I have no idea why I [share so much stuff already](https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/scared-of-stopping-sharing/), and indeed want to share more. Perhaps I have let the ego in too much, and it wants some praise for a task I am doing just for a bit of fun with my wife?

She’s still convinced she’s going to win, by the way! Never going to happen.

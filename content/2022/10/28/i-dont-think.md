I dont think it’s the time for mass abondonment of Twitter just yet, but I can see where it’s going already with the [Meme lord in charge](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/26/elon-musk-twitter-visit-sink).

It’s definitely a time to think about where you want to post and what you want to do online.

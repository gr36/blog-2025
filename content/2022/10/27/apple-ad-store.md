There’s very little for me to comment on or add value to the conversation around Apple [showing adverts](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/22/apple-announces-more-app-store-ads/) on their devices. There are many more knowledgable about the situation than I, and couple with the fact I don’t care currently, means I stay quiet. That said, the recent moaning makes me think back to the days I used to love Samsung phones and the biggest reason I quit was ads. 

That’s right, dear reader, I once very nearly switch to Samsung around the Galaxy Fold 2 / [Note 20 Ultra](/2020/10/06/samsung-galaxy-note.html) era. They were great phones and I enjoyed using them to review, but what put me off in the end was that I felt like I was the product. Adverts would constantly be displayed in Samsung apps, such as Pay. They even went as far as sending notifications and adverts right [in your notification area](https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-ads-your-samsung-phone) at some points. All of which completely put me off dealing with the company.

If you buy a cheap device, you expect companies to bundle in services and try to push you towards spending more money. You don’t, however, expect this when you spend upwards of £1,200 on a phone like the Fold 2 or Note 20 Ultra. Granted Samsung are possibly the worst offender in this space, and do similar things with their [expensive TVs](https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/co5aw4/unremovable_ads_on_my_2500_samsung_smart_tv/), so we might be comparing Apples to Oranges, but it just feels off.

I absolutely expect a company to be pushed to make more and more money, and I understand that people have a strange perception of Apple as a whole, but it’s starting to feel a bit weird all of a sudden. There is nothing immediate to worry about, but after years and years of Apple telling us they don’t do adverts and [yelling at other companies](https://gadgets360.com/internet/news/tim-cook-to-google-users-youre-not-the-customer-youre-the-product-594242) that treat their [customers as products](https://sigma.world/news/you-are-no-longer-the-customer-you-are-the-product-tim-cook/), it feels like the tide is turning.

Granted, these are only feelings, ones based on experiences with the worst of the worst, but I understand where some users are coming from. If we continue down this road, it could very well end up a disaster. However, rightly or wrongly, I do have faith that Apple will do this correctly. Unfortunately, I can look at the trashy adverts in Apple News and see a world where Tim Cook can’t be so preachy any more.

<p>Around this time last year, I gave up my work iMac Pro and began working on my personal MacBook Pro. In many ways, this was the best decision I have ever made because I can take my computer wherever I am in the office and also plug it into a monitor when I am working at home. Yet, my work and my creative life have never felt the same since.</p><p>I <a href="/2021/06/23/force-some-ipad.html">spoke at the time</a> of the deep cross-overs that these two areas of my life were having. Pondering over the use of an iPad for my personal life to introduce a bit of calm. This experiment didn’t last very long due to various factors including the iPad no longer working, but the idea is sound and given my <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/07/27/210805.html">recent struggles</a> is something I want to explore again.</p><p>What really tipped me over the edge towards iOS adoption again was a couple of excellent posts by Josh Ginter. Since March, he has been keeping a <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2022/03/28/keeping-a-separate-creativity-computer/">separate creativity computer</a> (an iPad Pro) due to being in a similar situation as myself. I hadn’t quite realised that the feelings he felt were the same ones swirling in my head until reading this. Indeed, he has become a proponent of a <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2022/06/17/keeping-a-separate-well-everything/">separate creative everything</a>, to build walls between personal and professional.</p><p>It makes perfect sense and drawing parallels in my photography life, I simply have to keep a separate ‘work’ and <a href="https://gr36.com/2022/06/01/keep-it-simple.html">family camera</a>. So with my work kindly supplying a new iPad for me to use, the experiment is on once again. I am hoping that the calmness and tendency for me to use one app at a time will give me some creative spark and allow me to <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/11/10/going-deeper.html">work a bit deeper</a> on the tings I enjoy.</p>

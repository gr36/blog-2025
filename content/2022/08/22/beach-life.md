Today was very much beach day. Not because the weather was great (it was OK but not great), but simply because we would rather not do anything. We donâ€™t have the luxury of being somewhere exotic so we have to make do with the English beaches. We sat in the waves for a few hours and enjoyed ourselves none the less.

Lucie has a love of the water and the ocean in particular, so she won't leave it until it's home time!

I even had a swim out to sea with my son, no-one wants to see photos of that!

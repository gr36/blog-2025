<p>A simple idea, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFvdHfhVIsQ">stollen from YouTuber Struthless</a> to replace what is ultimately bad for me, with something that is better. He replaced Social media with ‘micro-journalling’ to improve his mental health and found some exceptional benefits, so for the last couple of days I have replaced <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/31/of-course-i.html">my doom scrolling</a> with writing.</p><p>To succeed, let's face it a task like this <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/twitter-muscle-memory/">isn’t as easy as it seems</a>, I needed to make some modifications to the way my phone works. I am not actively avoiding Social Media (AKA Quitting) I am just limiting it. So, I had to make sure I wouldn’t open up Twitter without realising it, and pack my home screen full of the types of apps I wanted to use instead.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/f05a77c833.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p><a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-reading-flow/">Reading</a> and <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/my-writing-workflow/">writing</a> in all its forms went right on my home screen to make sure they are in my face as much as possible. I am trying to make as much use of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205773">Apple Notes</a> as possible to capture anything and everything that comes to mind. Having already started to lean heavily on it as part of improving my <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/putting-a-system-in-place/">overall systems,</a> the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/ipad/ipad5d91fd88/ipados">quick note function</a> coming to iPhone with iOS16 is a particular favourite new feature.</p><p>This didn’t work straight away, I had to delete all the social apps from my phone too, and also make sure I was signed out in Safari too. Now whenever I get the itch or find myself a bit bored instead of drifting away and scrolling social media, I write or read something instead. One often leads to the other and a few minutes down the line the feelings have, thankfully, gone.</p><p>There’s a habit of these types of posts to be preachy, but there is none of that here. This is simply what I am doing to better <em>my</em> day-to-day life. Again, this isn’t about avoiding social media, it is just me trying to be happier and at the same time write more – win-win.</p>

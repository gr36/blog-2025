<blockquote>
<p>Bigger phones are popular mostly because they are a computer replacement for a lot of people. As we do more and more on these devices a lot people want the biggest screen they can afford but there will always be those that just want something manageable (to them). - <a href="https://ljpuk.net/2022/08/26/there-is-no-ideal-size-of-smartphone/">Lee Peterson</a></p>

<p>Lee gets it spot on here, for a lot of people there only device is a smartphone and it makes perfect sense to have the biggest and best you can use. However there are a lot of people, myself and Lee included, that just want a device that gets out the way.</p>

However people like myself have to accept that the world wants bigger whereas Iâ€™d rather <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/12/08/putting-in-some.html">put some barriers in the way</a> to my screen time.</p>

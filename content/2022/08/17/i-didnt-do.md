I didn’t, as I suspected, renew my Glass subscription just [for the sake of it](https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/08/for-the-sake.html) I cancelled and deleted my account. Nothing personal and I know people around here love it, but the cost was not worth it. 

I still can’t really figure out why but this description from Marc does a good job of summing some feelings up. 

> "Glass seemed to be somewhat of a monoculture. This makes sense: everyone in the app is rich enough to own an iPhone, probably also owns an expensive dedicated camera, a laptop (probably a MacBook) capable of editing them, and has enough discretionary income to pay a monthly subscription to a social media platform. This is boring." - [Marc Wickens](https://imarc.co.uk/2021/09/01/glass-half-empty/)

There are entirely too many places to share [photos](https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/) and micro.blog + a bit of Twitter suits me fine. Maybe even some [Instagram](https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/16/ive-konmarie-my.html), who knows.

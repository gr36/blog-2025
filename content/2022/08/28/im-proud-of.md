Being the parent of a disabled child, I’m well aware that I need to curb my enthusiasm towards things. But today I am so proud of Lucie.

Not because she did anything special, or achieved anything anywhere near the markers that “normal” kids set down. But myself, my wife and son sat at a pub and had an enjoyable few hours. Not only did Lucie really enjoy the music being played. But she expressed herself, let us know when she wanted things and also told us that she wanted to stay a bit longer. 

She’s amazing, and I’m so proud of her.

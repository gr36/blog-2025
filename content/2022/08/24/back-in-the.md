> Creativity is a habit. - [Do the Work](https://dazne.net/work/), Danze 

Iâ€™ve fallen into a bit of a rabbit hole with [Rishabh Dassani](https://dazne.net) as it seems each of their posts speaks to me on some level or another. Giving me little bits of advice in productivity, organisation and life.

Some of the points outlined in Do the work have reminded me of things I have discovered myself and then let slip. I need to start [sitting in the chair](https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/sitting-in-the/) again and making my creativity a habit. My inspiration and [motivation to publish](https://gr36.com/2022/07/27/the-good-news.html) come in waves but only when I put the work in do I really make strides in publishing my thoughts and clearing my mind.

I write because I enjoy the [process of writing](https://gr36.com/2021/08/25/writing-consistently.html) and hitting publish is just a nice outcome.

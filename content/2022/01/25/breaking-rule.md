<p>Cheri imploring me to join no social media club<a href="https://hypertext.monster/hello/"> but not to talk about it</a>: </p><blockquote>My feelings are true to me, but I don’t want others to feel judged for what they choose to do</blockquote><p>Everyone knows it. The first rule of any club, doesn’t matter if its fight club or <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/goodbye-for-a-bit/">NSM club</a>, is you don’t talk about it. Breaking rule one is sacrilege and can lead to club banishment. Or in my case, people feeling bad — and I’m sorry.</p><p>I’ve had a few conversations over the last couple of weeks with people that I have talked through my choice to back away from social media and I’ve needed more words that I expected. Once you utter the words that you don’t use social media it puts anyone that does on the back foot. </p><p>Like a subtweet, or a slight of character it can feel personal. As if you’re casting aspersions towards anyone that does. Which in my case is not the case. I love sharing my thoughts and feelings on my blog, but also don’t want them to interfere with those of others.</p><p>There is no judgement here. You won’t find any big push to make you do something you don’t want to do. Whatever you choose to do with your own time is cool with me. More though needed when sharing on my part I think. </p>

Seth Godin writing about [things being good](https://seths.blog/2022/09/its-just-not-that-good/): 

> Not that good for who? If you mean to say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it, it doesn‚Äôt appeal to me,‚Äù then that‚Äôs what you should say. 
> 
> If, on the other hand, you have enough expertise and domain knowledge to say, ‚ÄúI understand what has appealed to the audience you‚Äôre trying to serve, and this isn‚Äôt going to work.‚Äù

Weird that this post should come up when I am consuming more tech reviews than I think I have ever done. Of course, the vast number of reviews come away with no conclusion and tell you everything is great, but a good number of them draw conclusions based on their very limited and niche usage. 

The decision on a product or service is good or bad is based on your experience. Some reviewers can think about how more general users would feel about things, but many do not. They extrapolate from their opinion, which is often clouded with other factors, and draw conclusions based solely on themselves. Using this to influence purchases from other people.

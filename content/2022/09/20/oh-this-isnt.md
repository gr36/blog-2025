Since moving to a [new domain](/2021/11/05/a-new-home.html) and trying to put all the things I create together online, I've been feeling a bit of pressure. Granted, completely self-imposed, but a very real tinge of anxiety to be better at what I publish there. A noble pursuit but one that’s made me feel down.

Before I discuss these worries, let's take a step back a bit and be honest. I'm playing pretend. In a world of writers, photographers and all around publishing masters — I'm not even small fry and the framing of this is important when discussing these types of worries. Simply because I shouldn't have them at all.

Publishing my thoughts to the internet was easy when I didn't care. My domain wasn't my name, and I wasn't even pretending to build some kind of online presence. I’ve been putting things online for a little short of a decade and never worried once about what it looked like. Something worth remembering because my blog in no small part is one of the reasons I have my day job. Yet now, I have some kind of [blogging yips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yips) because nothing is good enough to be published. 

There are no shortage of ideas on what to write about, but they rarely make it past a draft. To cure it, I’ve had to [strip everything back](/2022/09/16/why-gr-has.html) and make my writing more personal. Go back to my blogging roots and make my website about me again. I may be boring, I may make ridiculous typos, but it’s the only way for me to seemingly publish more often.

I am positive others feel this way because they compare themselves to others. It’s the way of the modern world online, comparing [your insides to everyone else’s outsides](/2021/05/31/insides-vs-outsides.html) and we all know it. Sometimes you have to get out your own way and just do it.

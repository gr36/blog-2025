<p>At the end of last week, I went off the grid. We packed our car full of camping equipment, turned all the gadgets off , placed them in a draw, and went into the wilderness. Well, that’s not quite true, we were nowhere near wilderness on a camping site with showers and entertainment – however we were as far as we can realistically go with Lucie’s disability.</p><p>Four days, spent doing nothing but walking, talking and enjoying each other's company. There might have been a bit of drinking and eating going on too, but it was a wonderful experience to just unplug and get away from everything. I did take <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/camping-for-the-jubalee/">my camera with me</a>, but it was the only electronic thing we had with us. No phones, <a href="https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/06/02/im-going-off.html">no watches,</a> and nothing to take your attention away from the present time.</p><p>I would like to say it was a glorious experience. Indeed, it was a very enjoyable one, and we had lots of fun and learnt lots about each other and ourselves. However, in times like this, you realise just what a difference tech makes to your life and you as a person. I have written several times about my realisation that to truly live in a modern world, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-cant-go/">you can’t be completely disconnected</a>. The world always needs an online application here, and an app for banking there – but there is nothing like just pulling the plug for a bit.</p><p>I observed numerous behaviours in myself that are totally technology-based. I found myself trying to check my email on my watch, despite not having one on. Not only that, but I tried to claim my Costa points despite having no phone, and I lost count of the number of times I swear I could feel my phone vibrating. Despite all this weirdness, it was fantastic, and I will do it again more often.</p><p>I am already in a habit of leaving my phone at home and relying on <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-ultimate-minimalist-phone/">my favourite minimalist phone</a>, but I am determined to try to do more. I truly think a period of going offline should be mandatory for everyone. Even if you discover you hate it, you’ll appreciate it even more.</p>

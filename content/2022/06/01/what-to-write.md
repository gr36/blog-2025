Do I try to force myself to write something, or let it come back on its own? The hard to take fact is that after months of having loads of inspiration on subjects to write about, the juices (and to a certain extent motivation) have dried up.

The truth is that I don’t want to force anything out just because I feel I need to. In the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald.

At the minute, I just don’t. My brain is a wash with taking more [photos](https://gregmorris.co.uk/photos/), designing new things and generally absorbing information instead of sending it out. So, when I sit down to write anything, there is nothing worthy that comes out – well, nothing I want to see published to the internet at least.

There are so many things that I just don’t care about any more. I can’t ever see myself writing another tech review, or going any deeper than fleeting hot takes on tech topics, I just enjoy doing different things now, and I think that’s OK.

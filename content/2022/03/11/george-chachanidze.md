For the first episode I would like to re-introduce a guest i recorded with last year. I am joined by podcaster, film maker and all round great friend George Chachanidze.

We talk all things in life including his thoughts on being really close to the current Ukraine war.

Check out his [videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/SnappyTech) on SnappyTech.

This crafty little ego keeps trying to work its way into my life. Today I am taking my son to Arsenal to watch a game, it’s his first time, so naturally he’ll want to take in the sites and take some photos. Unfortunately, my primary response is downloading Instagram ready to record some stories. 

Photos and videos as memories are one thing, but my ego wants to show off on Instagram. I’m ready to thumb my nose at my followers. Look where we are, look what we’re doing, we’re having more fun than you! 

Not all Stories shared are for this reason, but that *is* the reason I wanted to share mine. I might still do so, but in the right way because showing off is not like me at all. Sure I’m a photographer, but I try my hardest not to be an Instagram guy but if I’m not careful that [pesky ego sneaks its way in](/2019/04/14/letting-your-ego.html) again.

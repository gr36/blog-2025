Sarah Frier pointing out that [DJ Khaled is not your friend](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-12-29/why-are-friends-not-in-my-instagram-feed-2022-marked-a-shift?sref=Qk91czAc):

> This year, social media mostly stopped offering a window into the lives of our loved ones. It turns out that the social part of social media, which helped shape human behavior online and off for more than a decade, is proving to be something of a fad.

This tracks with almost every other news story about social media that doesnâ€™t involve Musk. Social media companies are trapped in a loop that limits friends posts reach to prioritise viral content, leading to less posts by friends, thus less posts to show you. 

As they all scrabble for your attention the only winners are advertisers, and those aiming for maximum attention. When there is no social in the networks anymore they just become a media channel.

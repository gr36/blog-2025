Matt Tait in [Pwnallthethings](https://www.pwnallthethings.com/p/twitter-was-special-but-its-time) hitting the nail on the head more than once, but the real sticking take away was this:

> Some people will love Trumpâ€™s tweets. Others will hate them. But Elon doesnâ€™t really care so long as you pay to talk about it and watch ads as you do.

Iâ€™ve heard take after take after take on Twitter and whatâ€™s happening, but this sums it up perfectly. The game to boost engagement is to have the best and worst things on the platform, and Twitter has been too cleaned up for Elons liking.

He does care who you like or donâ€™t like. I have no doubt that half the things he says he doesnâ€™t mean, but he is stuck with a $44bn bill to pay that increases at more than $1bn a year.

There is only one way to pay for this. The more people that use Twitter for talking about Twitter, the more ads are shown. Elon doesnâ€™t care if you like or hate the tweets, as long as you are talking about them on Twitter. The best thing you can do right now is just leave and never go back. Nothing that you get from the service has got to be worth this, surely?

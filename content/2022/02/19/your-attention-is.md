<p>Dan Counsell writing in <a href="https://www.dancounsell.com/i-will-not-buy-another-iphone/">I Will Not Buy Another iPhone</a>:</p><blockquote>Doing whatever they can to get my attention. The trouble is, I'm a sucker.</blockquote><p>Whilst I get it. The natural response is to blame someone else for the things that are wrong. The alternative, as Nir Eyal highlights in <a href="https://literal.club/gr36/book/indistractable-fqoiu">Indistractable</a>, is to feel shame in your weakness of not being able to resist temptation. The reality is that many of us are welcome aware of the manipulation going on, so are more than able to resist.</p><p>Marketing is not “too good”, you are not a “sucker”, and are more than able to take back your attention that has been stolen. Yet you must shoulder some of the blame to begin to do so, as bad as the internet is, <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/its-not-the/">it’s your fault too</a>.</p>

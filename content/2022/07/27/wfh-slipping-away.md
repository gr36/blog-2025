Over the last few weeks, I am having to spend more and more time in an office environment. There’s no rhyme or reason for it apart from the things I need to do need me to be there. I can slowly but surely feel my happy working from home routine being washed away. 

I am dead sure there isn’t, but it feels like every little step is some kind of grand plan to remove ‘the new normal’ and return to the old way. Perhaps working as we always did *is* the way to do it, but all I know is that I am happier, healthier and more productive working in my own home. 

Who knows what the future will bring, but the current requirements are playing on my mental health and productivity, and as a result my home life.

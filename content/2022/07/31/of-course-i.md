I am starting to think my brain is fundamentally broken. I [can’t sleep](https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/30/placebo.html), can’t [sit still,](https://micro.gregmorris.co.uk/2022/07/27/210805.html) and literally can’t do anything online without scrolling through social media.

It happens when I am not paying attention, and then I suddenly realise that post I sat down to write isn’t getting finished off, not are those photos getting edited. Instead, I am down a rabbit whole of the worst things about humanity or finding out why someone is getting cancelled on Twitter today.

I don’t think this is an attention thing like I have suffered from before, more of an entertainment need. Perhaps now is the time to take a step back from the online world and write more. That seemed to work for [Matt Birchler](https://birchtree.me/blog/when-im-coming-back-to-twitter/), and was a big reason I had a [very productive end of last year](https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/going-deeper/).

It isn’t easy for me to quite social media because it's pretty much where all of my social interaction comes from (sad I know), but I am going to try.

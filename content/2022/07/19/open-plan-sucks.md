<p>Mike Elgin on the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3666739/why-open-plan-offices-are-a-disaster-for-your-company.html">hopeful demise of open plan offices</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The open-plan office obsession, which probably peaked around ten years ago, was based on what I’ve called “collaboration bias” — the under-examined assumption that ad-hoc social encounters are more valuable for business, creativity, and productivity than un-interrupted “deep work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The amount of time wasted in stupid takes should be enough for companies to realise. Yet the insistence of all being together and maximising collaboration is based on lack of trust.</p>
<p>No one trusts their staff and fail to understand the true importance of deep work.</p>

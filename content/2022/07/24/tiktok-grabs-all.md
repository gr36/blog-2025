Turns out TikTok is [basically spyware.](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/privacy-2/2022/07/tiktok-is-unacceptable-security-risk-and-should-be-removed-from-app-stores-says-fcc/) 

> "TikTok is said to collect “everything”, from search and browsing histories; keystroke patterns; biometric identifiers—including faceprints, something that might be used in “unrelated facial recognition technology”, and voiceprints—location data; draft messages; metadata; and data stored on the clipboard, including text, images, and videos."

There was a weird sense of misplaced attention when Trump tried to ban TikTok during his tenure. Perhaps it was just hyperbole at the time but as pointed out above the Chinese based company gathers ridiculously large amounts of data on users. 

Including information on your clipboard, which could be passwords and other sensitive information.

Of course no uses will actually care because they get to watch silly videos and meme dances….

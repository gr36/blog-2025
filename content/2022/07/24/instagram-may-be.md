The well shared [Om post from a few weeks ago: ](https://om.co/2022/07/18/instagram-is-dead/)

> "“While Instagram initially fueled my passion for photography; rather than being inspired through the art of photography itself, too often I find myself chasing numbers of followers and likes. I realized that all this time I wanted to share my work to get a ‘pat on the back,’ rather than to inspire,” photographer Nicole Malina told PetaPixel."

Same same. But what is the solution for me to see all the photographers I enjoy following? Check up on all of their portfolios every so often? Use a different service with a fraction of the users?

Neither of these are tenable. Instead I’ll keep using it and hating it

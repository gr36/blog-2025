<p>Oliver Haslam <a href="https://www.imore.com/512gb-iphone-11-pro-max-costs-less-500-parts">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Which brings us back to my original point: these figures are interesting. But they can’t tell the whole story.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, a company tears down an iPhone 11 Pro and produces some costing involved. imore write a post about it and now I’m linking to it – all to say that these things don’t matter. I cant work out if I am part of the problem or if it’’s all rubbish anyway.</p>
<p>However that is to say that these sorts of posts come out every time a high profile phone is released and no one really pays attention other than a few publications that are seeking the clicks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This is how companies work, the cost of producing a product is less than the price you sell it for. No one is surprised right?</p>

<p>Iâ€™m new to drones, but decided to try one out to get some more interesting video and Iâ€™m glad I did. However because it is so new to me I didnâ€™t really want to spend loads of cash on one if I wasnâ€™t going to use it, so I decided to pick up a used<a href="https://www.dji.com/uk/spark"> DJI Spark</a> and DJI Spark controller one.</p>
<p>I managed to get a fly more kit with a few extras for a bargain price, but when it turned up I had issues connecting and paring. There wasnâ€™t a whole load of information out there other than forum posts, but I managed to piece everything together and get it working again. Hopefully the guide will help you as well.</p>

<div class="kg-callout-text">Before you do this, its a good idea to plug the spark into DJI Assistant and check the firmware version and / or factory reset it.</div>

<ol>
<li>Hold down the power button on the DJI Spark for 9 seconds until you hear three beeps. Then do the same on the controller.</li>
<li>Power off both the DJI Spark and the DJI Spark controller.</li>
<li>Power on the DJI Spark controller and then hold down the pause, Fn and bottom right shoulder button (underneath the camera button) until you hear continuous beeping.</li>
<li>Power on the DJI Spark, then press and hold the power button until you hear one beep. Make sure your DJI Spark controller isnâ€™t too far away from the DJI Spark. You will see the DJI Spark controller connect to the Spark and its lights turn green.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dont forget you need to WiFi connect to the controller (password is 12341234 for all remotes) and then open the DJI app. Hopefully youâ€™ll be up and flying in no time.</p>

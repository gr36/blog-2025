<p><span class="author vcard"><span class="fn">Joshua Fields Millburn <a href="https://www.theminimalists.com/walk-away/">wrote</a>:</span></span></p>
<blockquote><p>If I take on a new idea or habit, I do so because it has the potential to benefit my life. New ideas shape the future Me. Same goes for habits. Over time my ideas change, improve, and expand, and my current habits get replaced by new ones that continue to help me grow. Our readiness to jilt ideas or habits means we’re willing to grow—we’re willing to constantly pursue a better version of ourselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is exactly my feelings towards working on new projects and brining new things into my life too easily. Far too many times now I have gone too deep into things without enough thought and burnt myself out trying. Minimalism isn’t just about having less stuff, its about being intentional with everything you do.</p>

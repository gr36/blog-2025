<blockquote><p>Some numbers. Libsyn is one of the largest podcast hosts and they <a href="https://thefeed.libsyn.com/152-trademarking-taco-tuesday">put out numbers</a> on what the average size shows are.</p>
<ul>
<li>7.1% of podcasts get 5,000 downloads per episode</li>
<li>2% of podcasts get 20,000 downloads per episode</li>
<li>1% of poddcasts get 37,000 downloads per episode</li>
</ul>

<p>There are thousands of posts just like this all over the internet. Posting knowledge for others to consume as if they are some wise old prophet with a WordPress blog. Having read a few, there were some golden nuggets extracted, and I began to think about what I would tell myself if I could travel back in time.</p>
<h2><b>Don’t think you know everything</b></h2>
<p>This is one of the worst attitudes to take, and unfortunately, it seems a natural one. When you leave school all spirited and confident, indeed the world is your oyster, and you can do whatever you like. What you cant do is take it for granted, you don’t know everything, spend your time learning and growing.</p>
<h2><b>You are your own person</b></h2>
<p>Stand on your own two feet, other people might make you what you are, but they don’t live in your head. Be yourself and don’t be afraid to be that person at all times. Other people are not responsible for what you do or how happy you are.</p>
<h2><b>Hold your hands up often</b></h2>
<p>You will screw up; you will make mistakes – so when you do don’t be afraid to own up to them and take responsibility. Just because you made a mistake doesn’t mean you did it purposely and it certainly doesn’t make you stupid.</p>
<h2><b>Don’t cling to bad ideas</b></h2>
<p>You might have thought it was the right choice at the time, so to join your new love for owning up to your mistakes, don’t cling to decisions that didn’t work out. You might have chosen the way to go on wrong information, or things might have changed – doesn’t matter the reason, give it up.</p>
<h2><b>Get rid of half your friends</b></h2>
<p>Leave friendships that don’t bring you joy or expose you to negativity as quickly as you would a job or a partner. Don’t tolerate people just because you think you have to. All those people that you knew at school, if they are still around in 2 years, then they might be worth bothering with.</p>
<h2><b>No, you don’t love them</b></h2>
<p>Love isn’t what you think it is, stop using it out of context. You will know it soon enough.</p>
<h2><b>There are plenty of hours in the day</b></h2>
<p>Plan things, take advantage of everything available to you and don’t slack off. Your whole life will fly past in what seems like no time, but you have plenty of time to get things done.</p>

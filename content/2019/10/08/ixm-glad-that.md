<blockquote><p>There is no doubt that the always-connected1 and accessible Android devices have enabled all these use cases. The two combined have also managed to pull millions of more people into the digital age. Sure, iOS might be the more secure, more private platform that’s better for everyone. But it is not for everyone because it is not affordable to everyone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people seem to forget this, Android has made a whole range of devices available at a seriously cheap price. I am not sure that much of the world would be as connected as it is without Google pushing it so hard.</p>
<p>Sure they have their own agenda for doing so, but we should be thankful it exist all the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

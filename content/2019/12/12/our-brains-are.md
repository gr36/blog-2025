<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Tristan Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/opinion/digital-technology-brain.html">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who needs to hack elections or steal voter information when people will happily hand over scans of their faces when you appeal to their vanity?With our Paleolithic instincts, we’re simply unable to resist technology’s gifts. But this doesn’t just compromise our privacy. It also compromises our ability to take collective action.</p></blockquote>

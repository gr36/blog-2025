<p>Rebecca Jennings <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/12/2/20983760/instagram-removing-likes-authenticity">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instagram has a way of flattening lived experiences so that my best years look exactly like my bad ones, and that everything seems pretty good, all the time, for everyone. This, obviously, is not how life works for most people, and ever since Instagram has existed experts have debated what seeing an infinite scroll of other people’s happy moments is doing to our brains.</p></blockquote>
<p>This exact the problem with a platform I used to love so much. Instagram has been taken over by the ego.</p>
<p>It is now simply a place to try and show off what you have and how great your life is (protein: it isn’t). You are not sharing to Instagram for you, you’re doing it to instil jealousy in people that see the photos. It makes them feel terrible, it makes you feel terrible – yet you still do it.</p>

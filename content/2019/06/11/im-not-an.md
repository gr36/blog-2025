<p>The iPad lifestyle is almost a badge of honour now, a marketing angle, or some might think it a calling. However the be all and end all is the constant need to jump up and down and shout about it is getting a little draining.</p><p>If you need to spend a significant amount of money working in an iPad when a Mac would do it for free, I really question if you are working on an iPad at all. I choose an iPad because I had one, it was far better than carrying a laptop and got things done easier and quicker. It was a mobile device and as such kept much of the interaction paradigm I wanted from a mobile phone. I have been working on an iPad for more than 5 years, but it doesn’t mean anything to my identity in technology circles or indeed any other circles. I do not feel the need to mention it at every waking moment like some kind of mantra.</p><p>Not because I don’t care about working on an iPad, but because I don’t care what you do. Choose the device that works best for your stuff. I don’t think the argument or even commentary needs to be made. I work on an iPad, you might not, but I don’t need to make it my life’s work to convince you.</p><p>If someone has published a post about the iPad, there is little need to give it space in your brain, no need to comment on it for the next week. Write a link post or passive aggressive tweet. Why even be bothered by it? Leave it be.</p><p>Evangelism is for causes that need shouting about. Points that need arguing and debating with. The iPad is a computer, but I don’t give a dam what <em><em>you</em></em> do with it.</p>

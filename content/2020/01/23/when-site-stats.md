<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I don’t care about the number of visits to my blog, I certainly <a href="https://gr36.com/i-dont-feel-interesting/">don’t feel interesting enough</a> to get the volume I do, but I do value what readers bring to me. So I have started to look at behaviour stats for my blog and try and work out some engagement with my readers, with a view in increasing feedback.</p>
<p>These sorts of stats <em>do</em> matter to me, because I want to see when and where people stop reading and understand how to keep people engaged with me. Not because I want to manipulate them and monetise them like the standard technology obsession. There is no attention economy here. I do want to build up a conversation with them and encourage replies to my posts.</p>
<p>I am not obsessed with this, but much as <a href="https://gabz.me/2020/01/10/engage-like-a.html">Gabz wrote about</a>, I want some real interaction from my posts. I desire conversation and even push back. Reading a post and nothing happening is as useful as a Twitter ‘like’. I want interaction from people, and the best way for me to do this is to look at where readers go to on my site and what clicks.</p>
<p>One down side is that Google Analytics is almost impossible to get the hang of straight away for a lowly blogger like me, so I might have to look at alternatives shortly. I have also found that lots of organic traffic from search seems to bounce straight off so I may have a task on my hands. But I’m going to try. In the mean time I am learning new skills and understanding user flow so this task is not a complete waste of time.</p>
<p>Stats still don’t rank high on my priorities for reader numbers or website clicks, Humans do – so how do I talk to them?</p>

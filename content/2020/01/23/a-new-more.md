<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Holly B. Shakya  Nicholas A. Christakis <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-new-more-rigorous-study-confirms-the-more-you-use-facebook-the-worse-you-feel">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, our results showed that, while real-world social networks were positively associated with overall well-being, the use of Facebook was negatively associated with overall well-being. These results were particularly strong for mental health; most measures of Facebook use in one year predicted a decrease in mental health in a later year. We found consistently that both liking others’ content and clicking links significantly predicted a subsequent reduction in self-reported physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I can take it any more. Studies prove that Facebook makes you feel like crap. They do <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-51166339">awful</a> <a href="https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-marketing/advertising/facebook-refuses-ban-political-adverts-328619">thing</a> <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/leaked-memo-shows-facebook-executive-saying-company-was-responsible-donald-trump-getting-elected-1480946">after</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51200446">awful</a> <a href="https://consent.yahoo.com/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_0cf04ebd-67b5-4f06-97e6-00277b159d78&amp;lang=&amp;inline=false">thing</a>, yet people still use the garbage platform.</p>
<p>Facebook is the single worst thing to ever happen to the internet or society in general. It makes us sad, so narcissistic we annoy others, and splits us apart from other humans. All so we can share memes and check out or relatives we don’t care about enough to keep in touch with properly.</p>
<p>Doesn’t seem like a great exchange to me.</p>

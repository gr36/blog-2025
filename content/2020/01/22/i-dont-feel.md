<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I try not to be self-deprecating as much as I can; however I do suffer quite a lot with imposter syndrome. The great thing is, I have learnt not to check my blog stats, I’m not bothered about podcast downloads and I sure as hell don’t care how many people follow me on social media. Yet every time I do stumble over the figures, I am always surprised because I don’t think I am interesting enough.</p>
<p>I have no idea why people come to my blog, but they do, and I am happy that they get here. Some arrive through Google searches, which lead me down one <a href="https://gr36.com/started-showing-ads/">path the other day</a>, but some do still come from social media. I ask myself why?</p>
<p>When I listen to other people on podcasts, and read others writing, they seem infinity more interesting than I think I am. With more to say on topics that I find really interesting. Does everyone feel like this? Is the fact that I am posting more made people realise how boring I am? These are the types of questions I ask myself regularly, and perhaps I am going crazy thinking about it.</p>

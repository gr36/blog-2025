<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Matt Birchler <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/inoreader-lets-you-turn-sites-without-rss-into-feeds/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ironically, so much of the web is good at having RSS feeds that it was hard for me to find a use for this right away. I eventually figured out that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/nintendo-switch-new-releases/">the new releases page on Nintendo’s eShop</a> was a site I went to somewhat regularly just to see if anything new was there. I was able to save that URL as a web feed and now I’m getting updates as soon as new games are added. It’s pretty nice!</p></blockquote>
<p>Inoreader seem to always be on the cutting edge of what they can do. and one of the services I love using. They allow you to add in email newsletters and now also track pages that don’t have an RSS feed.</p>
<p>Like Matt above I really struggled to find a page I’d want to track – I tried the apple site and it didn’t work either!</p>
<p>Also you can only do this in their own apps, which is understandable, but I use Reeder so it’s pretty much useless to me.</p>

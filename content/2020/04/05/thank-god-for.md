<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Josh Topolsky <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/thank-god-for-the-internet">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But thank god for the internet. What the hell would we do right now without the internet? How would so many of us work, stay connected, stay informed, stay entertained? For all of its failings and flops, all of its breeches and blunders, the internet has become the digital town square that we always believed it could and should be. At a time when politicians and many corporations have exhibited the worst instincts, we’re seeing some of the best of what humanity has to offer — and we’re seeing it because the internet exists.</p></blockquote>
<p>It gets a bad rep does the world wide web.</p>
<p>Full of horrors, and screens and things your kids really shouldn’t be doing – but image trying to go through a lockdown without it.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be able to work from home, I wouldn’t be nearly as entertained and I wouldn’t be able to see anyone. I district myself with far too much internet at times – but thank god (or whoever) it exists.</p>

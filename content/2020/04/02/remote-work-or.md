<p>Being one of the lucky ones, I can continue to complete my work from home and exchange my work for money in the never-ending cycle of capitalism. I have already written about my <a href="https://gr36.com/regular-9-5/">destain for a regular 9-5 job</a>. I have kids to sort out, meeting to attend and just stuff to do in the day. We all have, and this has been highlighted more than ever during this time we are confined to homes.</p>
<p>I have been doing this on and off for a few months, but it’s still hard for me to do it regularly and consistently. At the moment I am working from 7-1ish and then again from 5-8ish, and this allows me time to share the care with my daughter. I don’t very often time sensitive things to do, so I am fortunate that flexibility suits me.</p>
<p>What I am hoping from this forced isolation period is that more companies start to open their minds to remote work. There is a wealth of things that can be achieved by adopting it, and working remotely should become what we all move towards. This isn’t going to work for everyone, but can work for some many people</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is, there are a thousand ways to do remote work, but it starts with committing to it at all levels of the company. If you assume positive intent and place trust in your coworkers and employees—knowing that if they do great work in an office, they can do great work anywhere—then you will all succeed. – <a href="http://ma.tt/">Ma.tt</a></p></blockquote>

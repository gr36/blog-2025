<p>Josh Ginter <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/the-2020-ipad-pro/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 12.9-inch iPad Pro excels on a desk, but grinds to a halt everywhere else. I haven’t picked up or walked around with the big iPad Pro in about six months and haven’t read with it on the couch in even longer. I often use the big iPad Pro at the office to digitally sign PDFs, but even that feels like a rewrite of all those clipboard adventures from sixth grade science class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just can’t agree with this at all. I understand that a bigger iPad means you have to make allowances and it isn’t as portable as the 11” version. However that doesn’t mean it “grinds to a halt everywhere else”. I read on my iPad most days sat on the couch or in bed catching up on RSS feeds or reading lists.</p>
<p>I also know many others that do the same, so making this sweeping statement is a little strange. I agree with the point that most people should buy the smaller version, but when I <a href="https://gr36.com/moving-to-the-bigger-ipad/">switched the the larger one</a> I have never looked back.</p>
<p>I am currently using my 12.9” iPad for absolutely everything and cant wait to get my hands on the <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1250473014304612360?s=20">magic keyboard</a>.</p>

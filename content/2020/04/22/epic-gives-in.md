<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Nick Statt for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229943/epic-games-fortnite-google-play-store-available-third-party-software">The Verge wrote a great article</a> that sums everythig up, but to pull out this quote from Epic’s statement speaks volumes.</p>
<blockquote><p>Google puts software downloadable outside of Google Play at a disadvantage, through technical and business measures such as scary, repetitive security pop-ups for downloaded and updated software, restrictive manufacturer and carrier agreements and dealings, Google public relations characterizing third party software sources as malware, and new efforts such as Google Play Protect to outright block software obtained outside the Google Play store.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t agree that anyone should give access to their customers away for free, but its time the standard 30% tax is looked at.</p>
<p>But the most important part fo this is that the long held belief that Android is open and you can do anything is fast disappearing. Google are pulling back on the reins and getting control of their platform. Which can only lead to a good things going forward – for Google anyway.</p>

<p>For the past year, I have been running my blog on the <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost platform</a>. It gave me the ability to have a site as fast as the static one I used to have, but with a much more powerful CMS behind it. When first testing it out and setting up memberships I knew this platform would be for me.</p>
<p>It allows me to keep control of everything from payments to blog posts, and send emails to you all at the push of a button.</p>
<p>Lately though it has been suffering from poor updates that have affected the site structure and inner workings. Updates have been released and then having to be patched a few hours latter due to some bug or another. Unfortunately the 3.22 update removed all the sites menus and emails settings, with a fix not easy to achieve.</p>
<p>This time I had made a snapshot of my server before updating, but this was just dumb luck not great planning. Having had to resort to the support forums for a few days running I have run out of patience with the lacklustre testing going on. I don’t want to bad mouth developers doing their best, but updates to the blog will be few and far between for the time being, until I can be confident these kinds of issues are sorted.</p>
<p>I don’t see myself switching anywhere else, but its times like these when a Mailchimp email and a WordPress blog seem like some welcome, if a little boring, tech resilience.</p>

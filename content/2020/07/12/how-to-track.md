<p>I would hope that no body starts morning that I am not writing about enough technology lately, but I’m finding it hard to write about anything at all. Never mind getting motivated to write about the very little news going around. I have been spending my time <a href="https://gr36.com/tag/cycling/">riding my bike when</a> weather allows, but when the bad weather comes I have to take it inside to the virtual playground of <a href="https://zwift.com/athlete/7b4045fa-cc88-4e49-92b4-f871e8811ef4">Zwift</a>.</p>
<p>Writing recently in <a href="https://gr36.com/gtt-9/">my newsletter</a> I covered my love of the cycling (and running) platform and trying to gamify my cycling as much as possible. I’m still in the very early stages but having just crossed into level 11, my aim is to complete as many of the available routes as possible. Unfortunately Zwift is not great at this, and although the information is obtainable, it’s not easy to work with. So I spent some time building a way to track it.</p>
<p><br /><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-8335452151565777" data-ad-slot="5524743860"></ins></p>
<p>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</p>
<p>There are loads of posts discussing several online and offline manual methods plotting out distances, XP points and the dreaded hilly bits. Thankfully a huge amount of data exists about each route, because so many people have ridden them. While looking for ways to automate this I stumbled on some spreadsheet methods on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zwift/comments/eqles5/i_made_a_complete_list_of_the_zwift_route_badges/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">Reddit</a>, and put together my own version combining several of them.</p>
<p>It’s dead easy to use, most routes link to information about the route you will take and the world used. The spreadsheet itself outlines distance covered (KM) and distance claimed (M) during the route, as well as the XP you will be rewarded for completing it. After a few weeks I am only at 12 % due to better weather currently, but I have done some of the worst – <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/route/road-to-sky/">Road to Sky</a> up Alpe Du Zwift, and <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/route/mountain-8/">Mountain 8</a> up the Epic KOM I particularly hated.</p>

<p>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</p>
<p>Don’t forget some worlds are only <a href="https://zwiftinsider.com/schedule/">open on certain days</a> so plan accordingly. Grab the spreadsheet from <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/content/images/wordpress/2021/01/Zwift-Routes-Download.xlsx">here</a> and start Zwifting!</p>

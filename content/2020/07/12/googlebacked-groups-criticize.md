<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Stephen Nellis and Paresh Dave for <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-google-apple/google-backed-groups-criticize-apples-new-warnings-on-user-tracking-idUKKBN2440VG">Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sixteen marketing associations, some of which are backed by Facebook Inc (<a href="https://uk.reuters.com/companies/FB.O">FB.O</a>) and Alphabet Inc’s (<a href="https://uk.reuters.com/companies/GOOGL.O">GOOGL.O</a>) Google, faulted Apple for not adhering to an ad-industry system for seeking user consent under European privacy rules. Apps will now need to ask for permission twice, increasing the risk users will refuse, the associations argued.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course they are kicking up a fuss. All of their shady tactics, designed to circumnavigate user permissions are being shut down one by one.</p>
<p>Marketing companies have been offered use of Apple tools to make sure ad targeting is working and numbers are reported well. This uses anonymous aggregated data – but this still isn’t enough. The tool is “engineered to not track users, there’s no need to request permission to track,” Brandon Van Ryswyk, an Apple privacy engineer,</p>
<p>These companies want access to user specific data and clear tracking of clearly defined individuals. These are not marketing businesses, they are spying on you and have made it looks like advertising.</p>

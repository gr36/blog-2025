<blockquote><p>No user in their right consciousness would look to opt-in for personalised ads considering its used for monetisation purposes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Quite often there is a push back, usually from people regarding Google, that they would rather see relevant ads than random ones. Whilst this could be true, the ad tracking and data storage doesn’t just stop with seeing more relevant ads, its tracks everything about you for no good purpose.</p>
<p>Personalised ads should be viewed as manipulation, and unfortunately most people just don’t join the dots. Whilst the statement above is a bit bold, as I think most people just taps yes because they don’t care – they really should start caring.</p>

<!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>social media companies are basically giant behavior-modification systems that use algorithms to relentlessly increase “engagement,” largely by evoking bad feelings in the people who use them.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>the algorithm takes a positive social movement, such as Black Lives Matter, and shows it to a bunch of people who are inclined to be enraged by it, introduces them to one another, and then continues to rile them up for profit,</p></blockquote>
<p>It was difficult for me to not copy and paste the whole article into this post because it is so poignant. I realise I am on a bit of an anti-silicone valley kick at the moment but I want to know what they are doing to me, and nothing I read comes out well.</p>

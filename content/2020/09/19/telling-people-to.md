<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Adi Robertson for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21419993/the-social-dilemma-jeff-orlowski-netflix-movie-review-social-media-algorithms">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>WhatsApp works almost nothing like Facebook. It’s a highly private, encrypted messaging service with no algorithmic interference, and it’s still fertile ground for false narratives</p></blockquote>
<p>After picking through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/16/21437942/social-dilemma-netflix-review-orlowski-sarah-zhang-memo-facebook-buzzfeed">Casey Newtons pick apart</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0">The Social Dilemma</a> I then fell on the linked post by Adi — and despite disagreeing on some major points throughout both posts — I found an interesting topic I had not considered. Where exactly does Whatsapp fall into these issues?</p>
<p>You can jump up and down about algorithms and Facebooks willingness to manipulate engagement. You can worry about Mr Zuckerbergs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/facebook-trump-free-speech.html">free spech bubble</a> all you like, but the simple fact is Whatsapp doesnt have any of these inputs, but is a top contender for spreading Fake News.</p>
<p>It is not as simple as simply blaming Social Media for eveything, undoubtedly it is a leading cause of social issues, but it is infinitely more complax than the surface level issues pointed at.</p>

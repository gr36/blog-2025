<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>The folding things are coming. You can’t get away from it. When I say things, I mean all sorts of things are going to be foldable, and it doesn’t matter your definition. It could be a tablet that folds into a phone-sized device or a phone that folds into something smaller. That fact that this year proves to be genuinely exciting for foldable devices should be enough.</p>
<p>The scepticism is somewhat understandable given the false starts with both the Galaxy Fold and Huawei Mate X, but now phones such as the Moto Razr and Galaxy Z Flip are hitting the mass market this should be fading. However, there seems to be lots of negativity still.</p>
<p>The detractors against such a device are vocal when any mention of both the Razr and Z Flip are spoken about on social media. With a consensus that a folding phone is pointless. To a certain degree that may be the case for your use case, but the fact that these devices are now available – with the latter sporting a glass screen – should be enough to get excited about.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/96f4685a1b.jpg" alt="960x0 1" title="960x0-1.jpg" border="0" width="599" height="395" />The fact that Samsung has made such a huge step forward just months <a href="https://gr36.com/galaxy-fold-handson/">after the Galaxy Fold</a> was released is bordering on insane. If this kind of pace of innovation can be maintained, then devices that will appeal to you as a consumer are right around the corner. Not every device is made of every type of user, but the fact remains that these devices are made for some users and selling very well.</p>
<p>Opinions regarding the device not appealing to your use case are one thing, but detracting from such a significant improvement in technology is another. It is an exciting prospect to have such a device hit the shelves, and I, for one, would love to get hands-on with one soon.</p>

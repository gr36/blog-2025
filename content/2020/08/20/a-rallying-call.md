<p>Since picking through a few ‘self-help books’ and business related topics I read through Ryan Holidays <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ego-Enemy-Master-Greatest-Opponent-ebook/dp/B01AWUTMB0/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">Ego is the Enemy</a>. As many people that talk about the book note, I too spent the entire time reading it nodding along. Noticing traits in me and others that highlight how dangerous the Ego can be.</p>
<p>So, I sat down whilst on holiday and typed out a follow-up post about my battles with <a href="https://gr36.com/battling-ego/">ego and my desire to keep moving forward</a>. Highlighting my trait of often writing instructional posts that I don’t follow myself. Perhaps being overly critical to myself, but signing off in much better place than when I started.</p>
<p>Even though I sometimes take this ‘do as I say not as I do’ approach it can be a <a href="https://micro.blog/ChrisJWilson/10084291">rallying call to myself</a>. As much as when I write things in my morning pages advising myself what to do, it gives me something to look back on and compare to, and also myself a bit of a talking to.</p>
<p>Writing can often be cathartic and work in strange ways to help clear out thoughts in my head. Allowing me to deal with things and offer out a finality once I hit publish. If post like this don’t help <em>you</em>, they give a rallying call to myself, and that helps.</p>

<p>Last week Chris Wilson opened up his newsletter <a href="https://learncreateshare.substack.com/p/sharing-despite-self-doubt?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNzM5ODM4LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo3NzEwNDYsIl8iOiJUSGJ3YiIsImlhdCI6MTU5NTc1MjAyNiwiZXhwIjoxNTk1NzU1NjI2LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItNDU5NzEiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.gGEKcZ15hKCqzKJR3bfcvlwcTs3LFeGa5IKLdvhIK08">‘Learn, Create, Share’</a> with the following quote.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Your problem,” my brother explained “is the same as mine. We’re bad at self-promotion because we were taught not to be boastful.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Undoubtedly this isn’t <em>the</em> reason I never made it as a writer or content producer, but it is something that I really don’t want to ever do. Sell myself to an online following is great if you can make a living out of it. However building a brand and resorting to clickbait titles, or constant self-promotion online is just not anything I ever want to resort to.</p>
<p>My online persona is the same as my real one, and I don’t see any reason to change. Fair play if that’s your thing, but too often I see great people I follow online build a following and then become boring bots of shameless self-promotion and shape themselves into something different.</p>
<p>Can it be self-promotion if you’re not being yourself?</p>

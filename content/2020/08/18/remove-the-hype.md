<blockquote><p>One of the things I wish we could take back as a result of the web: Hype culture. I much prefer being unaware of when something is being made until it is actually done. Release dates, months-long campaigns of hype, and a laser focus on the process are all bad for our culture.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had never really thought about this until Simons post. This is a huge drain on my motivation to check out a service now, as many seem to release half baked products and then build the hype around it first before actually solving a problem.</p>
<p>Quite often the hype before launch is the only time companies can sell a serious level of products and they soon disappear into nothingness. Marketing and bluster can only get you so far, but its annoying while it lasts.</p>

<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Matt Birchler <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/we-might-be-getting-that-120hz-iphone-12-after-all/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, just yesterday I was <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/should-apple-delay-the-iphone-12-for-a-120hz-screen/">weighing whether I’d prefer a high refresh screen or 5G in the new iPhones</a>, but if this is legit, it looks like I won’t have to choose. Can you tell how much I’m grinning over here?</p></blockquote>
<p>It was reading this post when it finally hit me, I am so far removed from things like this now that I simply couldn’t care less about screen refresh rates and other bells and whistles.</p>
<p>I am no longer interested in reading or even thinking about rumours of new iPhones. Specs and supposed innovations such as a higher refresh rate no longer dictate my buying decisions.</p>
<p>A year ago I would have been all over these types of things, giving my opinions and talking about it to anyone that would listen. I would have convinced myself that I NEED this new model because the screen will be so much better to use.</p>
<p>Now, every feature rumour I see does not make a difference to the way I use my phone any longer. Which is sparingly and for quick little tasks.</p>

<blockquote><p>Google, on the other hand, takes a different approach. Google literally stores exactly where you are, where you have been, and even the route you took. And, it saves that data. Sure, you could go in and delete the information Google has stored, if you happened to know how or where it was located. In reality, very few people did that.</p></blockquote>
<p>The minimal approach has its benifits, but also its downsides. When better results come from Google having more data – most people opt for that.</p>
<p>You be forgiven for thinking that people outside of the tech bubble care about their personal data to a level that these types of posts do. The worry fact is they don’t. Bilions of people still use Facebook.</p>
<p>Google has its place, and it is at the heart of most peoples internet – and that’s not going to change.</p>

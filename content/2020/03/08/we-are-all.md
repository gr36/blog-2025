<!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>A <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-02-screen-linked-epidemic-myopia-young.html">common culprit</a> for the increase in myopia among children is something you have probably guessed: screen time. According to a 2018 American Optometric Association <a href="https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/eye-and-vision-problems/glossary-of-eye-and-vision-conditions/myopia/myopia-research">study</a>, four in five parents say their kids spend at least an hour a day in front of a computer or mobile device. Miller argued that parents tend to grossly underestimate how much screen time their school-age child is actually getting. <a href="https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/eye-and-vision-problems/glossary-of-eye-and-vision-conditions/myopia/myopia-research">Doctors say</a> that the constant up-close interactions might be leading to an elongation of the eye.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have wondered for a long time the affects on eye sight of looking at a screens. You could chalk this up to the fact that we simply donâ€™t need to look as far in the distance as we once did. Evolution works both ways I guess.</p>

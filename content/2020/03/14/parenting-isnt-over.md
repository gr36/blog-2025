<blockquote><p>But however much initiative, energy, or emotional investment is required to accomplish a task, limit your contribution to 49%. Once you drift over 50%, you own it, and you’re likely to see your transitioner’s motivational investment diminish.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“Think of yourself more as a consultant than a supervisor—ready with your wisdom and guidance but allowing your son space to wrestle with the key challenges of initiative and ownership.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I struggle constantly with the input into my growing children’s lives and also those of others. My natural reaction is to do things for other people, often at my detriment, but recently I have been thinking more about other independence and where to contribute.</p>

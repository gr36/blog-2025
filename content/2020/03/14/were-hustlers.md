<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><strong>Amid coronavirus fears, this couple has made more than $100,000 reselling Lysol wipes</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>After filling up the bed of his pickup with stacks of wipes, Ranga drove back to the couple’s Vancouver home to unload the merchandise. Perez, 37, stayed behind, keeping watch over a second trolley-load, while munching on a Costco hot dog.</p></blockquote>
<p>I admire hustle. I love seeing people innovate and spot gaps in the market and carve out a space for themselves. Being the first to market with soemthing or working hard to do something unique.</p>
<p>This is not it. This is exploitation of the worse varitity.</p>

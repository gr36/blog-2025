<!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote><p>As for what phone I intend to buy, the differences between the Pro and Pro Max are substantial enough to for me to make the leap to the Max</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I worry the size will be too big for me</p></blockquote>
<p>These are the two statements that encompass my feeling around the new iPhones. I have a great camera (A7iii) but I don’t always carry it around with me. I am really interested in taking shots in proRAW on my iPhone and editing them later.</p>

<blockquote><p>the iPhone 11 Pro has had by far the best camera I’ve ever used in a phone, and yes I do include the Pixel in that statement.</p></blockquote>
<p>I whole heartedly agree with that statement. Android Cameras sometimes get very close (The <a href="https://gr36.com/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review/">Note 20 Ultra</a> being the best) but for some reason the iPhone gets better shots that are much easier to achieve. It’s not faultless but it’s just so easy to use that you want to take photos with it.</p>

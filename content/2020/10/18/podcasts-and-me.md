<p>One of the proximal causes of the COVID-19 issues here in the UK has been a dramatic reduction in my podcast listening. I no longer have any commute to speak of, and even though I have tried to listen in my home office I just can’t get into it.</p><p>The few I <em>am</em> listening to are, as <a href="https://thedent.net/2020/10/12/so-many-of.html">Andy would put it</a>, ones that spark joy in me, or that are too interesting to not listen to. So I have to find excuses to go for an extra long walk, or exercise a bit longer, so I can squeeze them in. You could say these are those that I like the most.</p><h2 id="reply-all"><a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all">Reply All</a></h2><p>“A podcast about the internet’ that is actually an unfailingly original exploration of modern life and how to survive it.” — The Guardian</p><p>I never miss an episode, some of the investigative journalism in the show is truly outrageous. From investigating Twitter memes to solving the internets mysteries, the episodes never fail to entertain me.</p><h2 id="wired-uk"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjQ1crYoL7sAhWwXhUIHaXlAWoQFjAAegQICRAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.co.uk%2Fpodcasts&amp;usg=AOvVaw1M-LdAfRYRWdTR1tyZAkQ9">Wired UK</a></h2><p>One of the few tech-based shows I keep up with because it is not about phone specs and the newest hardware. It’s about wider issues and improvements to technology as a whole.</p><h2 id="not-over-thinking"><a href="https://aliabdaal.com/not-overthinking/">Not Over Thinking</a></h2><p>A new discovery for me after watching many of Ali’s videos. Topics are wide-ranging and cover topics that make you think. As they put it they talk about “things that are hard to examine, but important to explore”.</p><h2 id="cyclist-pod"><a href="https://cyclistpod.libsyn.com/website">Cyclist Pod</a></h2><p>Since getting stuck into cycling, but not giving a damn about what the pros get up to, I searched for something that filled that gap. A comedian and a coach filled it superbly with this funny and interesting show for people just like me!</p><p>I am subscribed to a few more, but never get time to keep up to date with any others than these. I am sure many others have similar problems since ditching the commute, but if there are some I am missing out on please let me know.</p>

<p>My shiny thing arrived on Friday. The new iPhone 12 Pro was delivered really early in the morning, and within minutes started to fill me with the feelings that I knew it would. It feels pretty much the same as the last one, and also the one before that, bringing such tiny updates that if they hadn’t changed the edges to flat ones you’d be hard pushed to tell the difference. <em><a href="https://gr36.com/iphone-12-pro-thoughts/">Read more thoughts here</a></em></p>
<p>It doesn’t do anything new for me, apart from hurt my hands. Quite why Apple chose to move the design back to such an unergonomic one I will never know. Apple sold me a dream of owning a new thing that I really needed, but the effect too mere minutes to wear off. I have bought the new iPhone every year since the iPhone 6 and used them all the way through. Not because better phones don’t exist, but because iPhone suits me much better than anything else.</p>
<p>Undoubtably the iPhone 12 Pro is much better than anything else available, but I just don’t enjoy using it. I am not a ‘power user’ — which is a euphemism for use your phone far too much — so I do not need top of the line everything. For the last few months I have been using an iPhone SE as my ‘home’ phone and it is one of the best phones I have ever bought.</p>

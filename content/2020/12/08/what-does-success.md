<p>Before starting anything I do, no matter how small I find it important to think about what success in this task looks like. Some things are very simple, you donâ€™t need to comprehend the end result of taking your rubbish out, but the benefit of thinking about the desired outcome for all of your tasks proves very beneficial.</p><p>Success is completely different for different people, and dependant on what the task at hand is. For many of the things I do on a daily basis it is producing something physical. Something I can hold in my hand or look at on a screen and be happy with. So success for me in these task is producing something that fulfils, or exceeds, the vision I had for it when I started. Taking an idea and forming a blog post about it is pretty easy, my success is producing something I can hit publish on.</p><p>I do not measure my success on the amount of views, likes or whatever metrics surround it. However it <em>is</em> important to consider this in other situations. So what does success look like to you? When do you consider this before starting a task? Try thinking about it before diving in, not afterwards, and you will see just how successful you <em>really</em> are.</p>

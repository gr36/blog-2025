<p>Despite ordering weeks ago, out of the blue my MagSafe Wallet turned up yesterday. I happily posted a picture on Twitter and all of a sudden quite a few people wanted to ask questions about it. So, I thought I might as well answer them all at once.</p>
<h2>How Many Cards Can You Fit In It?</h2>
<p>There is space for three cards to fit, that’s it. No more. However, the case is quite a snag fit so you won’t have any issues using one or to cards in there without them falling out.</p>
<p>There is also obviously no space for money, it’s very minimalist.</p>
<h2>What Colour Did You Get</h2>
<p>I opted for Baltic Blue, which pairs really well with the Pacific Blue iPhone 12 Pro I have, and also the Blue silicone case I occasionally use.</p>
<h2>How Strong Are The Magnets</h2>
<p>The real question we all wanted to know. The short answer is they will be fine. However, the longer one is, probably not as strong as they should be.</p>
<p>When in use I don’t think the wallet will slide off without you knowing about it, but it doesn’t sit nearly as solidly as the iPad Magic Keyboard. Particularly at the bottom it doesn’t take much force to move it around, and when using the phone you can feel it move around some times.</p>
<p>The reality is if you are not paying attention and wearing slim fitting trousers it may come off when you put your phone in your pocket. Using the wallet with a case adds a bit more friction, but I would like to see the address in a future update — I don’t think it is as secure as it should be.</p>

<h2>Can You Charge With It On?</h2>
<p>Nope, not at all, no wireless chargers work with the wallet attached. Not only it is probably too thick, but the wallet is shielded so you don’t ruin your cards, so nothing will get through anyway.</p>

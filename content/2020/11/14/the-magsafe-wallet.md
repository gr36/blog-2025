<p>Yeah, I’m <em>that</em> guy this year. I couldn’t decide which iPhone size I wanted, so I <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1327606056562925569?s=20">got them all</a>. It’s a weird position to be in but also provides me with some deeper insights into the real differences. I am not talking about specs and all those kinds of figures that people get too caught up in, the real things that make a difference to actually using the device. One of the strangest ones I have had to think about this year is the MagSafe wallet — so here is how it fits with each size iPhone.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="MagSafe-Wallet-iPhone-12-Mini-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/dab53b524a.jpg" alt="MagSafe Wallet iPhone 12 Mini 1" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<h2>iPhone 12 Mini</h2>
<p>The smallest of the bunch is, somewhat understandably, the worst one regarding the MagSafe wallet. The iPhone 12 Mini is the same width as the wallet and the magnet position mean it goes all the way to the bottom of the phone also.</p>
<p>Meaning no margin for error, but a nice neat look and a perfect fit — in theory. In reality this means it’s the hardest to get on fully, and it’s also the easiest to move off the edge of the phone. The small size of the iPhone 12 Mini also means that it is the hardest to get off when you need to get a card out. Mainly because the only option you have is pushing it down from the top not side to side.</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Magsafe-Wallet-iPhone-12-Pro-1.jpg" src="https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/06439a696b.jpg" alt="Magsafe Wallet iPhone 12 Pro 1" width="1000" height="563" border="0" /></p>
<h2>iPhone 12 Pro</h2>
<p>The best compromise in the sizes of iPhones is arguably the best size to use the MagSafe wallet with. When fitting the wallet you have some room around the phone to position the wallet securely if you don’t get it right straight away. Also some space on the back of the phone to remove the wallet easier when you need to get a card out.</p>
<p>It lacks the neatness of the iPhone 12 Mini, but doesn’t look too bad at all. I have also found that when using the MagSafe wallet on the back of your iPhone 12 Pro or iPhone 12, the phone is easier to hold. I feel much more comfortable using my phone out the house without a case when the wallet is attached enabling a bit more grip.</p>

<h2>iPhone 12 Pro Max</h2>
<p>If you’ve read this far, you’re interested in what the MagSafe wallet is like with the biggest iPhone ever! The iPhone 12 Pro Max is humongous so there is no getting around that the wallet looks, well a bit weird!</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of room around the wallet, given the expansive slab of glass. It also moves around quite a bit when you are trying to use the phone, due to needing significant hand gymnastics. Quite often the MagSafe Wallet will move from side to side, and occasionally making me a little nervous!</p>
<p>The positive is that there is plenty of room for you to move the wallet to the correct position if you get it wrong. However, I would love to see a bigger version for the Pro Max simply so it doesn’t look so lost on the back of the phone.</p>
<p>MagSafe, especially the wallet, feels a little like version one so I am sure we will see revisions on future phones. Stronger magnets and better connections are a must as well as different sized accessories. However, the MagSafe wallet is a great addition to my fairly minimal lifestyle, so I’m pretty happy so far.</p>

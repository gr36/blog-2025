<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Mat Birchler on <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/multitasking-vs-parallelism/">Multitasking vs Parallelism</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  the ability to me to tell my computer to do something, and then I move on to totally different things while it does its thing. For me it’s out of sight, out of mind, but it’s still happening.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This for me is THE biggest issue I have with iPad os. By either inability or oversight, nothing can operate in the background well enough. Dropbox can’t sync correctly, I can’t upload a long video to YouTube very well, and generally doing something complex can suck at times.</p>
<p>It annoys everyone, full time iPad users included, so why the OS still can do this is beyond me.</p>
<p>But what’s the old iPad Pro saying “the next OS update will fix everything”.</p>

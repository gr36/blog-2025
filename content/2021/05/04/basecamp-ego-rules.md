<blockquote><p>
  They really don’t care what employees have to say. If they don’t think it’s an issue, it’s not an issue
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of all the words in this excellent write up these speak volumes to me. We’ve all seen this arrogance recent years, the ego that runs amok in the founders comes and bites them on the ass.</p>
<p>When you don’t listen to feedback, when you think all your ideas and experiences are the only ones that matters, you have a real issue. Running a company in your vision and being thick skinned enough to stand by your decisions is one thing. But when the success goes to your head and you become tone deaf to everyone but the chip on your shoulder sooner or later that will catch up to you.</p>
<p>I am in no doubt Basecamp is not going anywhere, there will be thousands of people itching to take over these positions that don’t care. They just want a foot in the door. However if this knock tells the founders one thing, it should be that they are not as great as they think they are. Listening to people doesn’t mean you take the advice or feedback, but means you must at least appreciate where your employees and users are coming from.</p>

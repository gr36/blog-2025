<p>How do you write a follow up post? Especially one where you’ve <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/my-glass-half-full/">changed your mind</a> just because someone on the internet said you should have stuck it out? Or do you avoid writing it at all and just hide away in blissful ignorance. Those are questions for other days, but today I <em>will</em> write it because I <em>did</em> change my mind and return to using <a href="https://glass.photo">Glass</a> and I am glad I did.</p><p>I did the same thing with Hey — the now divisive email app — and flip flopped around before diving in for a year. <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/08/16/glass-thoughts/">Glass</a> is different though, I don’t really know what to do with it but I can’t leave it because it just looks so good. I missed looking at the awesome photographs in one of the best designed apps I have used for a long time. It was simply the lack of being able to find such an enjoyable experience anywhere else that lead me to begrudgingly stump up the £25 entrance fee <a href="https://glass.photo/gr36/1E9mo3orrGY0IsUmVfENpU">and post a photo</a>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/bb6111f61b.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>I don’t want to write about Instagram again, because all those words have been said. Yet the lack of every other existing service is the very reason I was pushed again to Glass. As much as the lack of interaction on my photos was annoying, and the same appearance of the photos I saw is still true using a different service with different aims takes a change in mindset.</p><p>I don’t want Glass to be another social media service where I follow everyone that I know (obviously I will do) I want it to be something different. I just want to look at nice photos that people are proud off and at the moment Glass is chocked full of them.</p><p>As everyone posts their best photos from their highlights and no doubt catches up with all the great photos, they have taken over the years I am impressed by the standard of shots. In fact, I am almost embarrassed to post some of mine, because they don’t feel up to the excellent standard of those I am scrolling past.</p><p>I have deleted so many photos that I thought were great at the time, and fine on Instagram – but now I am playing photographer I am not so sure!</p>

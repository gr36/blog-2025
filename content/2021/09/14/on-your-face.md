<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Very few times in my blogging life do I have to go extremely far back in my archives. Perhaps a year so to reference in newer posts but usually not far at all. Today I had to go right back to 2016 where I urged people <a href="https://gr36.com/2016/10/09/please-dont-put/">not to put a computer on their face</a>. Of course, referencing the now infamous<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass"> Google Glass</a> which had been floating around for a few years previously, but at the time the latest thing was Snapchat Glasses.</p>
<p>As I said previously, there are few things that <em>really</em> worry me when it comes to technology but being surrounded by other people’s recording devices on their face is chilling. Without doubt the improvements made to smartphones, particularly cameras have helped the world at least feel a bit safer. If you’re in any doubt you can pull out your smartphone and record what is going on. The effect being a small degradation of privacy with a positive benefit to life. Whereas Google Glass and Snapchat glasses felt like more than a step too far.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was like reliving the past when <a href="https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/388482975992028/">Zuckerberg lauded up their latest innovation</a> along with esteemed Sunglasses brand Ray-Ban. They not only look pretty much the same as the Snapchat version, but with a much premium build quality, they are also set out to achieve the same thing – record as much of your life as possible. It’s at this point I start to think if I right in the thoughts I have about a product or am I just a grumpy old man that doesn’t ‘get it’. As much as I hate the approach of <a href="https://gr36.com/2019/07/06/life-through-a/">Living life through a lens</a>, I must accept that that this is just how the world works now; but putting it on your face just doesn’t sit well with me.</p>

<p>I am pleased to see that thought has been placed on some of the privacy issues. An LED light when recording or taking an image at least instills some confidence in me that I am not being recorded all the time. Facebook of all people have thought about the push backs that people had against previous attempts to face computers and implemented safety as best they could. Sure, it doesn’t take much to stop the LED from working or cover it over, but this is less likely with you are stumping up <a href="https://www.ray-ban.com/uk/electronics/RW4003%20UNISEX%20ray-ban%20stories%20%7C%20round-black/8056597489645">at least £300 for a pair</a>. Indeed, I do question if a pair of Ray-Bans on their face say more about the intended use than cheap plastic Snapchat ones? However, that is not only amazingly pretentious to say, but is also difficult to draw conclusions from.</p>
<p>Some technology I just don’t understand, and Face computers are one of the things I will never get. This is because the product is not for me, it’s for people that want to capture more things. Which in today’s world feels more understandable than it did even 5 years ago. I have no issues <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/07/29/having-a-camera/">holding up a camera</a> to take pictures, and I feel much more comfortable with people having to do the same. Indicating to me that my image is being recorded and making it easier for me to protest should I need to. We do indeed live in a world full of cameras, so camera glasses and no doubt AR ones are unavoidable. It’s weird that Facebook have allowed me to be at least a little more accepting of them, but I still have hope that they don’t take off.</p>

<p>I’ve been having a bit of a bad time currently. A few issues in my professional life coupled with being extremely busy has lead to me not being my usual self. Simmering in my grumpiness last night sat on my own and all I can hear is squeak, squeak, squeak. Looking over at my dog going to town chewing on his favourite toy. Ripping it to shreds and wagging his tail like the crazy dog he is. He’s in his element. Captivated by something so simple and experiencing pure bliss, and I want to know where my chew toy is.</p><p>I’d love to go back to a time when I valued something so highly that it was able to remove me from the world entirely. Captivate my attention and keep me entertained in a euphoric state for as long as I let it. I remember the times when a new colouring book would do this to me. Leave me oblivious to the world around me while I gave the blank pages a colourful facelift whilst sticking my tongue out. I don’t think the things around me have changed all that much, but I certainly have.</p><p>It’s not the things that put us in this state, it’s our ability to surrender to them. To let ourselves enjoy something with 100% of our being. Ever tried one of those adult colouring books? A perfect activity for a little while, and then your brain reminds you about all the adult things you should be doing instead and pops the little bubble of delight you had going. It is hard being an adult in a world that has so many demands on us, but that doesn’t mean we can’t get a chew toy every now and again, does it.</p><p>So, I sat looking at this happy little boy, ripping up his favourite toy and having the time of his life. All I could do is smile, laugh and soak in the second hand enjoyment. I instantly started to feel better because Charlie taught me something. To let go every once in a while and not dwell on things you can’t do anything about. Just enjoy your chew toy.</p>

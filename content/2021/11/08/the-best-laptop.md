<p>Joshua Ginter on the <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2021/11/03/the-m1-pro-macbook-pro-keyboard-is-different-than-the-m1-macbook-air-keyboard/">difference between the M1 MacBook Air and the new MacBook Pro keyboards</a>:</p><blockquote>There’s a noticeable difference between the new M1 Pro MacBook Pro Magic Keyboard and the M1 MacBook Air Magic Keyboard. The M1 Pro keyboard sounds different, has stronger feedback and actuation accuracy, and has smaller function-keys.</blockquote><p>I am no mechanical keyboard aficionado, but I love having a keyboard with the right amount of tactile feedback. There is something about having good key travel and a reassuring press that makes me feel at home.</p><p>It is remarkable how much faster I type, how more accurate I am, and just how much more I want to write on a good keyboard. I am sure there his some science behind it, but I am not sure how I would even sum it all up adequately. As I <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/can-you-stop-messing-around-with-keyboards-now/">wrote about previously</a>, the butterfly keyboards I used were fine, the return to scissor switches was of course better — but the new MacBook Pros’ keyboards are superb.</p>

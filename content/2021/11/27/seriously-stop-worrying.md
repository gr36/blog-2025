<p>Arthur C Brooks brings the fire to make you understand that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/11/how-stop-caring-what-other-people-think-you/620670/">No One Cares</a></p><blockquote>If I wouldn’t invite someone into my house, I shouldn’t let them into my head.</blockquote><p>I highlighted far too much of this article to share, the quotable things just kept coming. So I had to go back and read it again, just to make sure I got the real feel of the words on the page, and found it quite revealing.</p><p>To discover something that Marcus Aurelius observed almost 2,000 years ago that applies perfectly to todays worries is quite shocking to me. “We all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own,” should be a waring post on social media. Why worry about what others are thinking when you should really be worrying about yourself?</p><p>Because it feels very personal when we feel socially harmed, even if that is only perceived. Our brains are made for &lt; 150 person groups of gatherers, not thousands of people online so it&#039;s important to remember that there is no need to worry about what others think, because in actual fact they don&#039;t care.</p>

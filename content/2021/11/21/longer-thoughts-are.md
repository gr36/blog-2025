<p>Josh Ginger <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2021/11/20/the-honeymoon-phase/">on honeymoon phases with new devices</a>:</p><blockquote>By then, it’ll all be too late.<br />But at least it’ll be true.</blockquote><p>It’s as if Josh had been reading my mind. The rate of publishing and the things being published has been a big theme of my thoughts of late. I’m not worried about being the first or the best, but I like to write <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/something-to-say/">things that mean something</a>.</p><p>I got pretty good at telling what devices were going to be useful when reviewing numerous phones. Sure, I still got caught up in the excitement, but devices like the Galaxy S21 Ultra and the Galaxy Fold 3 I could tell within a day or so if they made any difference to me. But of course, I had to handle a lot of tech to do this.</p><p>If anything I am the reverse now, I dismiss things and then when I actually read or watch reviews I start to see where they could benefit my workflow.</p><p>With all this said, I always try to take in reviews after time with the device. I have lost count of the number of videos reviews I watch claiming the device is the best thing ever, only to have another on a few weeks later on why they are returning it. Some of this is of course YouTubers being YouTubers, but the honeymoon period feelings are strong and should be considered.</p>

<p>I know what you're thinking…. again! This time I haven't fallen out with myself and moved just because someone else <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/migrating-from-wordpress/">told me how good their blogging platform is</a>. Or decided that I want to try to quit something yet again. This time it's a little more important because I have got my hands on a new domain and wanted to build something to last.</p><p>After years of trying, literally the first time I tried was 2014, I have managed to purchase gregmorris.co.uk. It took a while of going backwards and forwards with domain buyers, but here we are. Now that I have a domain that reflects me a little better, I wanted a website that reflects what I am up to. It didn’t seem right just porting my <a href="https://gr36.com/">scruffy WordPress blog</a> and I have been lusting after something more portfolio based for a long time.</p><p>My first thoughts were to implement my photography into my blog posts here on Ghost, but I annoy enough people with the range of things I post about that I didn’t want to worsen it with my photos too. So I built this.</p><p>It isn’t all my work. The theme started off as <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Edge">Edge</a>, a photography-based theme that is official and free. The theme looks lovely, but I dusted off my skills and made a blog page to go with it that is brand new. I also tidied up the CCS, made things my own and implemented a dark mode (your eyes will thank me). I’ve worked really hard on it, hence <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1456334349880680459?s=20">the radio silence for a while</a> and dedicated a lot of my time to learning many new skills. Likewise, I keep expecting things to break, but they seem OK at the moment as long as I don’t <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/i-need-to/">keep playing with it</a>.</p><h2 id="what-about-gr36">What about GR36?</h2><p>Nothing will happen with that domain for a while. All of my posts have moved over, but redirecting all the historical traffic I get will take some time for me to work out how to do it best. I will more than likely keep the domain around for the foreseeable, and do something with it once I am happy that everything is done correctly. I am a little sad that after more than a decade blogging <a href="http://gr36.com/">gr36.com</a> might die off, but I am excited that my website better reflects my interests.</p><p>For the next few weeks, expect internal links to be a little broken on my new website as I update everything. I kept all the permanent link structure the same, but there is no avoiding a complete domain change. I have a new <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/rss/">RSS feed</a> which I may point the GR36 one at shortly.</p><p>I would love to know your feedback and opinions on anything I should change, privately if possible.</p>

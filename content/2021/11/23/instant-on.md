<p>For those of you not following me on Twitter (and why not <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1461374261491384330?s=20">I’m hilarious</a>) I bought an Xbox Series X. I’m not a big gamer by any stretch, but having <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/love-stadia/">played Stadia</a> for quite a while I thought it was time to branch out on some hardware, and I am so glad I did.</p><p>Those of us that have busy lives or just generally kids and partners that need attention, know the realisation you don’t really have time to play games any more. Many people's modern lives are not conductive to playing for long periods of time, and as such we often miss out completely. There are some thoughts on games getting much shorter to complete, but the average game still takes <a href="https://www.looper.com/297615/how-long-would-it-take-to-beat-every-video-game/">more than 25 hours</a> to polish off.</p><p>If you’ve been nodding along and thinking the same as I, let me introduce you to the wonderful world of <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/hardware-network/power/learn-about-power-modes">instant on</a>. Available on both new Xbox versions (and I think the PS5) it removes a major sticking point of gaming for me. With instant on there are no credits to watch, no introductions to get through and very little loading at all. You can be in a game within seconds, and it’s glorious.</p><p>Sure, instant on might be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/how-the-xboxs-default-instant-on-feature-could-harm-the-environment/">killing the planet</a> a little faster, so I guess my gushing should taper a little. However, the fact that I can grab a small slice of time to myself in between everything else I have to do has been brilliant. I can leave races midway through on Forza when duty calls or go and do something between matches in Fifa, all without having to worry my game is paused somewhere — which was my solution before.</p><p>I am never going to be able to sit down and game for long periods of time, but the small 20 or 30 minutes here and there mean I might actually play some games again. The small hump of motivation to actually switch the Xbox on and not have to update GB worth downloads nor watch credits might just save my sanity a little. Praise MS for Instant On.</p>

<p>There is nothing more annoying that technology not working the way it should do, without any fix. Well, maybe there is, but this is me we’re talking about, and I’m pretty neurotic about these types of issues. I have been battling being able to <a href="https://twitter.com/GR36/status/1463063190238027782?s=20">log in to third-party Twitter clients</a> for ages and have finally stumbled on a fix.</p>
<p>This will also address some issues with using Twitter to sign in on other services. Some users have issues not from a third party client but simply sharing to Twitter from elsewhere. The error in question has no code, no help, but lots of hassle. When trying to log in to Twitter, it displays “Nothing to see here”.</p>
<p>Upon some <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/twitter-login-fail-shown-nothing-to-see-here/158809">cursory Googling,</a> it seems that only iOS users suffer from these issues. Perhaps Android just handles these things better, let’s be honest, iOS can be user hostile when it comes to many web things. Solving them sometimes a puzzle in comparison to more user-friendly solves from Google.</p>
<p>The answer thankfully seems to be simple, if impossible to find, so here you are following my guide.</p>
<h2 id="option-one">Option One</h2>
<p>The first thing to try, and the one with the least aggravation, is to try your email instead of your username. Seems to sort out some issues, but failed to be the answer to my prayers. This is the fix that most third-party apps suggest, along with turning off two-factor authentication, signing in and then turning it back on again. Give it a go first.</p>

<h2 id="option-two">Option Two</h2>
<p>You’re going to have to purge all the Twitter web information from your device. This is the likely culprit and unfortunately, when compared to macOS or literally any other operating system, it is all or nothing. There is no option to only clear Twitter related data.</p>
<p>Head into your setting, go to Safari, and tap on ‘Clear history and website data’. This should resolve the “Nothing To See Here” appearing after putting in your login details. Allowing you to log in to a new app or authorise a secondary service.</p>

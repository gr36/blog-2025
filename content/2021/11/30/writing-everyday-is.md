<p>Joshua Ginter’s <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2021/11/29/thoughts-on-writing-each-and-every-day/">thoughts on publishing every day</a>:</p><blockquote>There are nights where you just want to veg and play video games rather than throwing something together for the blog. There are times when you don’t have a fully formed opinion and you sort of puke it out into existence. Or you create filler pieces to get through a few days.</blockquote><p>This whole piece covers some of the thoughts that have been floating around in my head since publishing more often. I thought about posting something similar later on this week but Josh does this far more eloquently than I would. So I thought I might as well throw some of my own words behind his.</p><p>When I first set my goal to publish every weekday for a month I had <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/a-writing-kanban/">loads to go at</a>. Ideas were flowing and at one point I had 4 days worth of posts ready to go. This gave me some runway to slow down a little and let thoughts arrive, and of course, they arrived less and less as the days went by. So as I got closer to days where nothing was sat in my ideas tray I began to feel the pressure. Rather than writing when I <a href="/2021/11/19/something-to-say.html">had something to say</a>, I wrote because I had to say something.</p><p>Some posts I am proud of, some not so much, but I have learnt a lot along with way. My practice of writing every day is years old at this point (most of my words are just for me) but it helps me get ideas straight in my mind. Writing blog posts is no different. I often start with a small idea, pull on that thread and it evolves into something new, and often interesting.</p><p>I love thinking about things and blogging is me doing that in public. It gets tiring giving yourself pressures and goals, so I <em>will</em> slow down, but I still want to keep the momentum going somewhat as I love doing it.</p>

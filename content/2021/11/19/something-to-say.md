<p>I am very dismissive of publishing my thoughts on many topics tech related. More so about devices and news that I am very late on. I figure that most people have already read or watched what they need to from the real tech people. Ones that get the product first or find something new and published the first article.</p><p>I am not the only one that feels like this, and it’s not just technology. Game reviews are also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/10/12/video-game-reviews-bad-system/">considered broken</a> by many because smaller reviewers stand little to no chance of being heard when the review things weeks after bigger sites. I have spent years fighting the negative feeling of my hard work ending up getting very little attention. These thoughts very often make me wonder if to bother at all and I see this in many others.</p><blockquote>You don’t write because you want to say something, you write because you have something to say.“ by F. Scott Fitzgerald.</blockquote><p>Except I do. We all should. If we have something to say, that should be said (written, painted, acted, whatever medium you choose), do it. If you have thoughts that you <em>want</em> to express, just because others have similar thoughts doesn’t make them any less valid. I don’t publish because I want to publish things, I do it because I have something that I want to publish.</p><p>It’s an easy mistake to make. I made some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh8W4NIk9kL_l8YEAd5KIDQ">technology review videos</a> in years gone by because I just wanted to make technology videos. I didn’t have something to say really, I just wanted to be a “YouTuber” like others I look up to. Don’t get me wrong, I think they came out OK, and I continue to make videos currently — but it was for the wrong reasons and quietly died out.</p><p>Feeling these feelings of not being heard is not unusual, but if you have something to say, say it — but don’t say it just because you simply want to talk.</p>

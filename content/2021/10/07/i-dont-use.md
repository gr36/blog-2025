<p>Every time I tweet these words or heaven forbid say them out loud, I get a wide variety of strange looks and responses. Many of which I couldn’t really understand and some of which could be the start of alienation completely. For some strange reason, some people took this personally — and that’s weird.</p><p>You may see my lack of need to use my phone as a statement of superiority. That I am looking down on those that do use their phones a lot, and while it could come across like this, nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is I could be seen on the same level as those weird families that didn’t have a TV while you were growing up. Not in a modern way — they don’t feel the need because they watch shows on a tablet or laptop — but because they don’t like it. These people seem to look down on others that did have a TV, and as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKjJQ5q32b4">Joey on friends asked</a>, I never quite worked out what all their furniture pointed at.</p><p>I did use my phone a lot in years gone past. When spending hours and days on the road it became my lifeline back to my family and my working device. Sure <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/one-year-of/">I had an iPad</a>, but my phone was always the biggest and best battery life iPhone I could get. It never left my person and I used it constantly.</p><p>Until the iPad mini was announced I was also talking myself into going with the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/minimalism-and-big-phones/">Pro Max version</a> this year and wrote about my thought process behind it (and some self-affirmation I needed). However, I spend most of my day sat at an iMac and when I am at home I just want to be away from things. So, my phone only fills in the small gaps now, it’s <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/iphone-13-mini-review-problems-solved/">small itself</a> because my needs have changed. I don’t use it much, but not in a weird way!</p>

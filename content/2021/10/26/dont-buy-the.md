<p>Matt Birchler with some <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/the-only-apple-silicon-mac-you-probably-shouldnt-buy/">comments on the MacBook to buy</a>:</p><blockquote>I would argue the only Apple Silicon Mac I can’t recommend is the 13” MacBook Pro. It’s several hundred dollars more than the Air and gets you the same performance in a larger body.</blockquote><p>My first thought was of course you wouldn’t buy the 13″ model when something so good has just launched. To be honest I wasn’t really aware that the ‘older’ model (can’t really call it old now can we) was still available but sure enough there it sits starting at £1299. No doubt to give Apple a marketing angle that their pro laptops start at a lot less than they actually do.</p><p>Sure, look at the MacBook Pros in isolation and the base model, hell even the £1499 512gb version is an attractive purchase for some people. A saving of at least £400 is nothing to be sniffed at. However throw the MacBook Air into the mix and it makes no sense to go for a cheaper Pro.</p><p>There will be some people out there that need 4 ports, or want to squeeze out a couple extras hours of battery life and there are some <em><em>very</em></em> minute <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/uk/face-off/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro">differences in performance</a> but for the saving of several hundred pounds more the macBook Air is the machine to go for unless you have deep pockets.</p><p>Edit: turns out the 13” MacBook Pro has the same two ports as the Air. So even less reasons to buy it.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  The crux of having other significant others (as coined by psychologist Eli Finkel) is to have your needs met from more than just your romantic partner. Your partner cannot always meet all your needs even if you expect them to. So, these are the people who would go along with you to exercise or listen to you vent about things your partner isn’t interested in hearing.

<p>This is some of my issue and why I keep a lot of things to myself. I do not want to burden my wife with my problems, but have no real significant others the share things with.</p>
<p>There are people that <a href="https://gr36.com/reaching-out/">reach out</a>, and I am very grateful for this. But how personal do you get with people before feeling embarrassed? Looking back I’m not sure I’ve ever had friends close enough to share my frustrations and worries with. That’s pretty weird isn’t it?</p>

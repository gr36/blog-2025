After reading some other bloggers writing workflows and even looking at some diagrams to illustrate them that I realised how simple my own is. One thing I definitely don’t want to be worrying about is where my posts go, and wondering what to do next — but I guess I’m a pretty simple guy!

In fact just looking at the graphic on [Numeric Citizens](https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/02/01/our-secret-optimizing.html) post makes me stare in amazement. I cont even keep up with having more than one notes app, never mind about publishing to more than one or two websites. I take my hat off to him, but I love having one avenue to worry about my words going to and then in syndicate everywhere.

I am interested in what goes where and why, as if anyone has a method to this madness it’s JFM.

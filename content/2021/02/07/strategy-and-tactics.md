<blockquote><p>
  If you’re not trying to cause an action or some other change in attitude or belief, then what’s the purpose of the deck?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I keep trying to instill these thoughts in every person I come across that requests a meeting or creates a deck for one.</p>
<p>What are you trying to achieve? What change do you want to make to attendees actions or mindset? Because if there isn’t a clear message then we are just going to watch slides full of information we could of read on an email.</p>
<p>It’s a business cliche that half the meetings should be emails, yet the meeting and pointless decks keep coming. I follow a few simple rules to clean my diary of guff.</p>
<ol>
<li>No agenda = no meeting</li>
<li>No possible solutions outlined = no meeting</li>
<li>A way to solve this with a meeting = no meeting.</li>
</ol>

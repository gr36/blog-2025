<blockquote><p>
  For most part of the 12 months I was eager to go back, but there has been a change in the last few months. I think it hit me too late that I have been without physical human interactions for so long.<br />
  I have now bundled down into myself which does not want to get exposed.

<p>I know this feeling well. I love working from home and I don’t want to go back to a place of work full time but I wonder if this isn’t going to be good for me long term.</p>
<p>I am both perfectly happy and lonely at the same time and it’s only if some checks on me that a state is observed.</p>

<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Matt Birchler <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/matt-goes-back-to-the-mac/">on his purchase of a MacBook Air</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Next up is figuring out an angle to talk about this machine, because itâ€™s great and I want to shout about it from the rooftops.</p>
<p>  Iâ€™m going to use it a bit more than normal over the next week or so because itâ€™s new and shiny. Maybe Iâ€™ll leave my iPad for good because of how good it isâ€¦but thatâ€™s not likely ðŸ˜›
</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt does these posts every now and again that sum up why heâ€™s done something. And at first glance this post seems like a bash the iPad post. But it does a great job of summing up the reasons for using a Mac â€“ and I agree with all of them.</p>
<p>While the iPad can do a lot of great things, editing video is not one of them. Lumia fusion is ok, but missing so many things that both speed up workflow and make editing much easier. If you make an iPad app you must cater to touch input and that doesnâ€™t work all the time, especially when you have complex features and menus 2&gt;3 levels deep.</p>
<p>I can see a world where iOS and Mac have a lot of cross over but distinctive traits that make them great at specific things. Theres still something holding the iPad back for some things and thatâ€™s ok. Letâ€™s not squeeze things into holes they are not designed to fill, but embrace them because of what they are made for.</p>

<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Andy Nicolaides <a href="https://thedent.net/2021/02/23/blogging-with-heycom.html">on the new ‘blogging’ in Hey</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  One of the guiding principles of Hey, to me, seemed to be some simplicity and relaxing of email norms such as inbox zero and the like, so a blogging platform in an email service does, at first glance, seem a bit odd. It is, however, as I said a really interesting approach and idea and it’s something I’d definitely jump on trying if it does every become a shipping product.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hitting the nail here on the weird dichotomy of the new feature teased by Hey.</p>
<p>It’s both a completely stupid idea, but also one that is very interesting indeed. One of the things I enjoy about <a href="https://email.gr36.com/">my own newsletter</a> is because I write it like an email to all the subscribers and not a blog post like some do.</p>
<p>This new feature in Hey, <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1363956784600281088">not yet even announced for users</a>, will allow readers to subscribe to future posts in email or by RSS. Making it not really a blogging option, but instead a really interesting take on the newsletter boom and one I will definitely keep an eye on.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Facebook states that choosing between tracking users for personalized ads and protecting their privacy is a ‚Äúfalse-trade off,‚Äù claiming that it believes it can provide both.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Why are you not providing it then ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
<p>This par spin Facebook puts on its actions and the attempts to curb its control are getting laughable. We all know what Facebook is like, we all know their company is run by some one letting his ego run a mock, yet they try and spin the story every time.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg has a tendency to lash out when provoked so it will be interesting to see what happens. I can‚Äôt think of much they can do to harm Apple though?</p>

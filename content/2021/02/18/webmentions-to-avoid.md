<p>Perhaps avoid is the wrong word, but weâ€™ve all felt that annoyance that we opened the app to send a quick tweet and all of a sudden time has disappeared. There are a number of ways to avoid this and the <a href="https://gr36.com/twitter-muscle-memory/">Twitter muscle memory</a> that goes with it, but getting <a href="https://gr36.com/needing-feedback/">feedback from my blog posts</a> is still an important loop for me to fill.</p>
<p>So, the indieweb comes to the rescue and provides much of what I seek through webmentions. By using <a href="https://brid.gy/">Brid.gy</a> I can receive a webmention to my WordPress blog whenever someone likes or replies to my post. I can check these every so often, or set it up pretty easily to get an email if someone replies.</p>
<p>All of these responses poll through Bridgy every so often, and then if a link is found that accepts web mentions, it is forwarded to my WordPress Blog.</p>

<p>After me approving them, likes and comments show up as native comments, with avatar and a link straight to the tweet.</p>

<p>It is an elegant solution collecting feedback on your work, and not having to check and reply to things.</p>
<h2>Replying to a web mention</h2>
<p>If the reply or wingback is from a page that supports webmentions I can reply to it straight from my blogs comments section. For example, when my post appears on micro.blog and someone replies, I can click reply in the comments and it replies straight back to them on micro.blog as if I was using the website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nothing exists to the do the same on Twitter so if I need to reply I have to head over to Twitter. But I can got straight to the tweet with a click and reply easily.</p>
<p>This has helped to avoid these rabbit holes I disappeared down and made me a bit happier the times I did visit Twitter to scroll through.</p>

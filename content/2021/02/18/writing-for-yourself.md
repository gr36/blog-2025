<blockquote><p>
  That made me think, if money isn’t going to be a significant factor in any decision, and I have no desire to write for a specific audience, then I may as well just write for myself. Then if people like what I write about, then great, and if not then it doesn’t particularly matter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been banging on about this for a while, but not taking my own advice (I’m good at that). Still trying to <a href="https://gr36.com/asking-giving-and-blogging/">build something that works</a>, still seeking those numbers. When in reality it’s not what I want.</p>
<p>If growth is your game, <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://ljpuk.net/2021/02/15/do-you-need-to-find-your-blogs-niche/">find your niche</a> and do that, but it seems like a pretty boring writing life to me. I’d rather write what I want, when I want and not worry about it.</p>

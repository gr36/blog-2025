<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Matt Birchler <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/i-still-love-blogging-on-ghost/">nailing it once again:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  One man’s bullshit is another man’s essential features, but for me, Ghost does away with all the stuff I don’t need and excels at what I do need.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This can be expanded to soooooo many things that people get upset about. I’m the person Matt knows personally and moved to Ghost. While I moved back to WordPress for <a href="https://gr36.com/i-didnt-want-to-move/">other reasons a year later</a> I get exactly what Matt is saying here.</p>
<p>So many of the things I wanted from my blog in the form of webmentions and indieweb things are completely BS to most people. But <em>I</em> wanted them so they were essential to me.</p>
<p>Your blogging platform is a tool and will depend on what you want, and what you enjoy using. The most important thing is writing on the things!</p>

<p>After <a href="/2018/01/20/using-microblog-aka.html">trying</a> and <a href="/2019/12/15/bye-microblog.html">failing</a> several times, I am starting to move <a href="/2021/02/04/digital-social-distancing.html">further and further away</a> from Twitter. I still check in every once in a while, but a good long break is helping to stop my impulses and <a href="https://gr36.com/twitter-muscle-memory/">curb my impusive usage</a>.</p><p>I don’t hate Twitter, far from it, I love it, I just want it to do more than it does. It offers a platform that has barely moved forward for years, and just isn’t <a href="/2021/01/11/social-media-in.html">powerful enough for the modern web</a>. So I still cross post everything to Twitter and visit perhaps once or twice a day to check my mentions. I might even scroll through if I am feeling particularly interested and see what is going on, but in the main part I stay away a lot more than I did.</p><p>Which has gotten me thinking about where it fits in and the image I want to portray. I deleted my <a href="/2017/11/12/i-finally-deletedfacebook.html">Facebook account fully in 2017</a> after months of not using it because I didn’t want to appear like I was Ghosting people and this situation feels remarkably similar. I am sure people understand that a blog post is probably auto posted, but my micro.blog posts appears as if I have posted them myself and slow or no replies seem a bit rude.</p><p>One of the reasons I love <a href="">micro.blog</a> is because it is so slow. It is based around stopping, thinking, and writing a response properly. Taking a <a href="https://ljpuk.net/2021/02/11/take-a-breath-before-you-post/">breather before you tweet</a> is an important lesson, but one very rarely taken. So Twitter sometimes feels like a whole network built on “this is why you’re wrong” when in reality it is just the fast paced nature of the platform.</p><p>Twitters whole deal is instant, always on connection constantly being updated. So, slow replies don’t fit in here. I don’t want to appear rude, and I certainly don’t want to cut it off completely, but you may not get many replies from me anymore, and I hope that is ok.</p>

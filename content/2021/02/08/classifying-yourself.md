<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Kaitlyn Tiffany on <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/02/aesthetics-wiki-cottagecore-tumblr-tiktok/617923/">Cottagecore</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The impulse for classification is a staple of internet life—tag yourself; add your interests; pick your favourite croissant, and we’ll tell you the Taylor Swift song that sums up your life.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I had no idea what on earth cottage core was when I clicked on this. Turns out it’s yet another way for people to get attention online.</p>
<p>But this statement really stuck out to me. Classifying yourself as something seems to be so important to people, and even fleeting trends on social media seem to need a name.</p>
<p>This label thing seems to be huge in tech. “I’m and Apple guy”. “I’m a manga nerd”. “You’re an Android user”. The need to exist in a group runs deep into our core (see what I did there) and we cling to labels in almost everything we do.</p>
<p>When thinking about who you are, it’s important to know these things and recognise their importance in your life — but don’t make labels important to your existence.</p>

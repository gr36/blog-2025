<p>Andy Nicolaides on the <a href="https://thedent.net/very-for-good/">outlook of some tech commentators</a>:</p><blockquote>For many millions of people out there, VR could, and already can to a certain extent, open their lives to opportunities they can’t currently enjoy and experience. We’ve all heard the laughs and sniggers about watching a concert with people virtually but for so many people, VR may finally give them a chance to experience something many others of us would take for granted. The argument for and against VR and a meta verse is always so black and white, but the world is rarely so easy.</blockquote><p>I tried really hard to not open with a social media trope but — so much, this!</p><p>I am sick and tired of people that have an important voice and an influential following making these kinds of takes. Most of these boil down to “If it doesn’t work for me, it’s stupid”. Granted, I didn’t listen to the whole show, just the clip Andy posted, as I stopped to listen to this show a long time ago because of these hot takes. So, I may be missing some kind of grand explorer or inside joke, but I doubt it.</p><p>The fact that <em>still</em> people can’t think outside their box is frankly ridiculous. VR is 100% never going to be for me, and I laugh more than a little at the way Meta pitch it to users, but much like Facebook itself, I can’t still see why some people would use it.</p><p>I am not sure if this is just playing to the audience, as this ‘sad VR looser’ rhetoric is a tired joke at this point. Making comments along the link of “don’t you go outside” or “don’t you have friends” misses an entire section of the population that can’t. <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/missing-the-accessibility/">Missing the accessibility angle</a> (this post is from three years ago about Connected doing the same thing) is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age.</p><p>VR is <a href="https://abilitynet.org.uk/news-blogs/8-ways-virtual-reality-could-transform-lives-disabled-people">already helping people</a> access parts of life that you take for granted and the fact you can’t even be bothered to look into this make me think much less of you.</p>

<p>I really should be slowing down this late into December. In times gone by, I would have been twiddling my thumbs for at least a week by now. Yet, I am working more than ever, getting ready to launch.</p><p>New websites, new printed media, new marketing angles, it’s all exciting times. But exhausting nonetheless.</p><p>I have spent far too much of the last few weeks sat down, and I know it's bad for my body. I can feel the change in my hips, legs, and core. I feel crushed up and no amount of exercise and stretching seems to make any difference. I adore my job, though.</p><p>Luckily, I only have another week to go, and then it’s holiday time! I am really looking forward to a break and recharge my batteries. Family time always makes my soul completely.</p>

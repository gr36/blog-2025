<p>Due to my fixed nature and habits I donâ€™t change my home screen very much. It stays pretty static, containing one page of icons and some widgets in slide over and thatâ€™s it. Not <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/i-dont-use-my-phone-much/">using your phone much</a> has its benefits, but a few changes are worth sharing, so hereâ€™s an update to see out 2021.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="uploads/2024/fe6fe8762a.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><h2 id="apps">Apps</h2><p><a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a> - I think I have tried <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/looking-for-my/">every notes app out there</a>, and despite trying to use Obsidian for everything, I love to write in Ulysses. The small price per year is worth being able to publish and update posts in Ghost alone.</p><p><a href="https://www.getupnext.com">Upnext</a> - Replacing Pocket as my read it later service.

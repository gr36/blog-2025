<p>There are so many things in my life that cause me to think about for far too long. I dwell on things that shouldn’t take me as much time as I do, and then make others based on sheer gut instinct alone. Hell, a good 70% of this blog is me talking to myself about a decision but framing it as if I am giving advice. In most of the situations, I know what I should do, but I don’t want to.</p><p>Take my photography for example. I know that I shouldn’t <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/do-i-like-likes/">care about likes</a>. I am also well aware that in fact I should delete <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gr36m/">my Instagram account</a> entirely, but that is just never going to happen. I like people seeing my stuff, and my friends only seem to use apps developed by Meta. I like the little hit of dopamine that I get from a few likes every now and again. The answer to make me a better person is obvious, but sometimes despite knowing this, another option is also valid.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/68392d4c1f.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>Instead, I’ll spread my photos around the internet like confetti and see what sticks. Waste my time doing all the things when I know what the ‘correct’ thing to do is — for me, at least. This expands into a lot of my life, I can never decide on <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-iphone-line/">which phone to get</a> despite knowing which one I shouldn’t. I know I should <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/twitter-muscle-memory/">really cut Twitter</a> out of my life, but I don’t want to. I am sure there is some psychoanalytic name for it and some deep-rooted reason for this indecision, but at this point in my life I just don’t care any longer.</p><p>There are of course some things I know I have to do for the better that overcome this barrier. Eating well, meditating and exercising to name a few, that will never fall away despite me having a million and one reason to stop. But for everything else, I will continue to give myself a hard time about it, and that’s OK. I think.</p>

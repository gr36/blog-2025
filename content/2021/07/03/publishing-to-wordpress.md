<p>If I can be allowed to stick my neck out a little here, I think the iPad is the perfect blogging device. The battery life is great, it’s very affordable, you can take it anywhere and interact with it in several different ways. In a pinch you can even take photos with it, although you might get some strange looks. Publishing from iOS has also never been easier, and here’s how to do it with a couple of Shortcuts.</p>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>Often choosing images is the hardest part of a blog post, once you’ve chosen them you have to upload them and choose where you want the go. Which can be a real pain particularly on a mobile device. WordPress is pretty easy to work with but means you have to stop what you’re doing and use either the web or their app to sort out images. This is usually where people give up, but fear not, the Shortcut below will upload your image and copy the markdown syntax for it directly to your clipboard.</p>
<p>This Shortcut was created by <a href="https://initialcharge.net/projects/toolkit/">Mike Rockwell at Initial Charge.</a> who has a whole toolkit of Shortcuts for publishers.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/211e433487.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="307" /></p>
<p>Get it <a href="https://github.com/gr36/Shortcuts/blob/276ec6a1d0773fabb11f8f8bdd85ab5b634db1ef/Upload%20Image.wflow">here</a></p>
<p>No more messing around, simply select your image, use the shortcut and paste in where you want the image to appear in your writing. You’ll need to set up a <a href="https://tinypng.com/developers">Tiny PNG account</a> with this one so you don;t take up too much space with your images and pages load faster, but its really easy to do. In fact because this Shortcut is so simple I sometimes now upload the images I want to use and paste them in first.</p>
<h2>Publishing To WordPress</h2>
<p>Once all the words are finished, the final step is to publish your posts. This usually involves copying the text, opening the web browser, logging in and going through the various steps of actually getting everything out there. This can be streamlined down to a few taps using the Shortcut below. It is one I have <a href="/2021/01/28/shortcut-publishing-to.html">shared this one before</a>, which was first created by Tim Nahumck in his <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-4-siri-shortcuts-wordpress-and-more/">drafts review</a> I simply updated it to use newer Shortcuts methods.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/ce3789c3fe.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="307" /></p>
<p>Get it <a href="https://github.com/gr36/Shortcuts/blob/276ec6a1d0773fabb11f8f8bdd85ab5b634db1ef/Publish%20to%20WordPress.wflow">here</a></p>
<p>This Shortcut will transfer all the text into a new blog post for you, as well as set the title correctly, remove any extra spacing and then ask you to confirm categories and tags. Meaning you don’t have to rely on using a app with publishing built in, you can now write your post out in any app you like such as Apple Notes.</p>
<p>There you have it, you can publish to WordPress with a few taps thanks to Shortcuts on iOS.</p>

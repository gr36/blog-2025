<p>One of my most enjoyable newsletters is <a href="https://tablethabit.com/">Tablet Habit</a> by Jeff Perry, particularly because I am <a href="/2021/06/23/force-some-ipad.html">diving back into the world again</a> and using my iPad for everything. I have been lucky enough to be linked by him a few times and it always makes me feel very humble.</p>
<p>I never feel <a href="/2020/01/22/i-dont-feel.html">interesting enough to be linked to</a> and frankly never expect my things to be read, but after years of doing it you would think that my thoughts would have changed towards myself. Donâ€™t get me wrong I have had periods in my life where my ego has gotten away with more than it should, but I think its important to always remain at least a little bit grounded.</p>
<p>However my feelings are different. I am amazed when people say they read my things and it still feels weird even after a decade.</p>

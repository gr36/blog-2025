<p>One of the best things about blogging and sharing things on social media is the constant changing environment and shifting your perspective. Yesterday I shared a few thoughts on <a href="/2021/06/11/but-what-about.html">what I am going</a> to try and stop on Twitter. The level of what about this can get annoying, so stopping it myself is a worthwhile endeavour.</p><p>Most people seemed to share a similar outlook, and the tweet below from Andy made me think a little more or letting people enjoy the things they enjoy – but also hate whatever they want to hate.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Everyone is quick to say that you should let people enjoy things. Should you not then, in turn, also let people complain / disagree / dislike things, as long as it’s done in a constructive / kind way?</p>— Andy (@AndyNicolaides) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyNicolaides/status/1403418821134794753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>This wasn’t directed at me, but seeing as I had not long shared my post, I took it as a sub tweet or at least something to pay attention to. Well, he’s dead right.</p><p>It’s important that everyone has a way to vent when they want to. If the prevailing opinion is that you should let people enjoy whatever they want, then we should be letting people hate whatever it is they want to hate.</p><p>Hate what a political party is up to at the moment? Let it out. Want to tell others have stupid Apple is? Go for it. Enjoy the release without 17 replies telling you how wrong you are.</p>

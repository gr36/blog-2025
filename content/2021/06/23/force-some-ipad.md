<p>When I think about all of the hardware I have owned over the last few years there are far too many in that list that I care to admit. I do switch around phones every so often for reviews, but my personal computer life takes on huge dramatic swifts every now and again. Since <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/today-is-the/">prosumously ditching</a> the iPad after more than 5 years as my computer I have gone <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/using-an-ipad/">backwards</a> and forwards switching out laptops, for iPads, and back again. I think it’s time to stop.</p><p>In fact I think it was time to stop a while ago. I am really starting to struggle with work and life separation due to only having one Mac now. So much so I don’t want to open my laptop at home. I know that I will dive in to things that I, granted need to do, but don’t need to do when I wanted to write a journal log.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/f74adb8b16.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>I have some inspiration to thank for my meandering thoughts. Jack Batty <a href="https://copingmechanism.com/2021/trying-to-live-on-the-ipad-for-a-while/">wrote about</a> wanting to try and make the iPad his everything, and this part particularly stuck out.</p><blockquote>But, iOS is calmer than macOS, and right now I need a little calm. – <a href="https://copingmechanism.com/2021/trying-to-live-on-the-ipad-for-a-while/">Jack Baty</a></blockquote><p>To use the word that tech commentators hate to hear — when I am ‘working’ on an iPad (e.g. writing a blog post or editing a photo), it <em>feels</em> different. As Jack puts it, using iPad OS is calmer, it never feels like work. Granted sometimes it’s a full time job trying to work out how you do somethings that are simple on a Mac but <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/the-simplicity-of/">the simplicity</a> is so refreshing. The iPad feels <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/this-feels-more/">computer<em>ish</em></a> without feeling like the rest of my waking life.</p><p>So, here’s the ‘forcing’ part. I am going all in again. Apart from my work day, which I can do nothing about, I am using an iPad for everything else. I haven’t spent anything, it’s a 2018 12.9″ iPad Pro with a Magic Keyboard I have had for a long time so I have nothing much to lose. I am actually quite excited.</p>

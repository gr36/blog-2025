<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>My daughters toy says this to me every time I hand it to her. Its nighttime based vocal cues and music prods her towards winding down and going to sleep. For <a href="/2016/12/27/oh-hello-am.html">how long who knows</a>, but it helps her drift off. I’ve never really paid attention to this until today whilst thinking about the very same things.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’m not old, but I’m not as fast as I used to be — me to my wife after a run
</p></blockquote>
<p>Whilst trying to up my <a href="/2021/02/15/why-do-i.html">running</a> millage now the weather is better, I am forever having to tell myself to slow down. My legs are stuck in this weird pace that I can handle for 10k but not for much longer and I have a habit of blowing up with too many miles to go. A lesson I should have learnt by now, but one that doesn’t just stop at running. I also have a sustained habit of <a href="/2021/02/16/cross-posting-to.html">tweeting too fast</a>, thinking too fast and hitting projects too hard too soon.</p>

<p>Try as I might, I just can’t slow myself down some times. I haven’t expanded the internal monologue that happens whist running to the rest of my life. It’s a lesson that I have read quite a <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/twitter-idea-delayed-tweets/">few times</a> lately and one I needed to add my support too. I have recently been introduced to the GTD tag of “<a href="https://productivityist.com/using-energy-levels-as-contexts/">high energy</a>” and this makes perfect sense to me. Don’t go hard all the time, slow down and go hard when you can.</p>
<p>Slow doesn’t mean as slow as possible it just means slower than you might expect. Doing things at the correct pace is one of life’s biggest lessons. That pace is going to be different for different people, and different times of day and hell even different periods of time. We are constantly encouraged to move faster, work harder and fill every waking moment with something that others deem important. When in fact it’s time to slow down, do things properly and maintain them for longer.</p>
<p>When it comes to tweeting, maybe just don’t instead.</p>

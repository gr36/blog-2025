<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Matt Birchler on <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/i-made-a-mistake/">making a mistake</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  And finally, it has been a healthy reminder that the internet can push anyone down a rabbit hole towards believing something false. We all try to be rationale people, and we’re all convinced that what we believe is reasonable and other people are crazy, but none of us are above being pushed into weird (and sometimes dangerous) beliefs with just a few clicks.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I constantly read that people that believe in conspiracy theories or have outlying views on the world are stupid and should know better. If you fall for miss information, or just form your views a bit differently to others then you almost deserve it because you’re dumb. That may be the case for the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ideas-jason-pontin-less-speech/">weird and wonderful</a>, but as Matt points out above its really hard to work out what’s true on the internet.</p>
<p>As much as on the internet no one knows you’re a dog, no one knows your true intent for what you publish. Everyone falls down these holes, and it’s important to remember that.</p>

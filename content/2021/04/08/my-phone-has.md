<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>For at least the last 4 years, each night I have taken off my Apple Watch, and placed it on a charger next to my bed along with my iPhone. So for the time I am asleep, or at least <a href="/2021/02/01/113519.html">trying to be</a>, my phone is within arms reach on a standup charger.</p>
<p>This helps tremendously as I always have a bedside clock on hand that glows with a subtle bump to the table, and I can be at the mercy of my alarm within a few seconds. But it also means that at any point I can reach over and entertain myself when I should be sleeping.</p>
<p>We’ve all done it. “Just Checking” Twitter before going to bed and an hour disappears as you <a href="/2020/09/09/its-not-the.html">descend a rabbit hole</a>. Or perhaps you see it light up as a notification comes in, and now you’re fully awake because the supermarket had a great offer for you at 2am. Thankfully I am one of the lucky ones that doesn’t need to be contactable at night, but I’ve only just realised that moving your phone into another room is the way to go.</p>

<p>It was only through pure accident that the realisation hit me. I was ‘between’ phones and having to use an <a href="/2021/02/24/185046.html">iPhone SE 2016</a> that relied on wired charging. As such it lived in my separate office for a couple of days until my new one arrived. Meaning everything was left until the morning, the extra effort to get out of bed, cross the hallway and retrieve my phone meant that I just left it alone.</p>
<p>That bit of extra space meant I slept better, felt better and the difference was so stark that despite no longer relying on a charging cable, my phone dock now lives in the other room permanently. I hope it likes its new living space, along with all the accessories that go with it. I still do grab it sometimes but much less than before. I wish I had done this sooner.</p>

<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Zach Phillips on <a href="https://little.zachphillips.blog/2021/04/02/workflow-second.html">generating work before building a system</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  A common experience I have as an unbearable software nerd: I get a peek at a system that a prolific person uses to create their prolific output and think “God, Microsoft Word? Are you an animal?”</p>
<p>  I then go back to tinkering with my Grand System which has generated nothing yet.</p>
<p>  While I do think it’s a tragedy that any person is still using Microsoft Word, I’m looking in exactly the wrong direction.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t know if it’s because I’m blinkered by my life online but I spent this whole post thinking about how this relates to blogging and writing.</p>
<p>Over the years I wasted so much time messing around with my blog that I spent less time putting out posts — and I know <a href="https://micro.blog/JeffPerry/11240196">others do this too</a>.</p>
<p>That’s not what people come for. Sure a nice blog design makes it easier to read things, but there’s little point if there is nothing to read anyway. The system is less important than the things we put into it, so do that first before worrying.</p>

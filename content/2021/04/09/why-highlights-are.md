<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s only a few months since I covered <a href="/2020/08/22/my-reading-flow.html">my reading flow</a>. It’s something that has changed a lot in the last year due. Motivated by my desire to take more advantage of the time spent engrossed in a book or catching up on my queue of online articles. This doesn’t matter when and where I am doing this, but one thing I’ve come to rely on is highlighting and being able to read them back.</p>
<p>Only when testing two new upcoming reading apps (super top secret sorry) that are yet to implement highlights that I realised how important they are. Without even thinking I draw my finger across the screen to highlight a specific sentence or passage that I want to remember. When that doesn’t happen, I don’t feel like I am getting the best I can out of this experience.</p>

<p>Many things slide past without needing to be highlighted, but more than a few times I have had to put the article into another app so I can save the highlights for later. I <em>could</em> try to do this with <a href="/categories/shortcuts/">Shortcuts</a>, but there is something about being able to see what you’ve read and which bits are important. Remember how satisfying it felt to bust out the marker and highlight things on your school texts?</p>
<p>These highlights typically end up on social media, lead to a<a href="https://gr36.com/categories/link-posts/">link post</a> or are saved to refer to later. <a href="https://readwise.io">Readwise</a> definitely helps with pushing these into <a href="/2020/08/21/how-to-start.html">Roam</a> for me, but there are a huge number of ways to read these highlights back and let the information sync in better. If you are thinking about using a service, or creating a new one, highlighting should be top of your list.</p>
<p>Not everything needs highlighting, but everything needs to be able to be highlighted.</p>

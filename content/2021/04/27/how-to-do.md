<p>Despite it being a standard feature in many Android phones it took Apple until the iPhone XS to implement <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT209044">a dual sim of sorts</a>. Even then you need to have one as an eSim and that limits the networks that can support it. Thankfully EE were one of the first, so for the last few years I have been using two sims in my iPhone, one for work and one for personal.</p>
<p>One major pain is dealing with moving phones. I do that quite a bit, so ordering a paper EE eSim each time became a pain, not to mention an expense at £1.50 a time. Preplanning helps a little, but there has still been times I’ve been without service because I’ve broken my phone and can’t just pop my sim in another.</p>
<p>Thankfully EE have a solution, and you can now download an EE eSim for your iPhone in seconds! Here’s how to do a digital EE eSim swop.</p>
<p>You will need your current sim to be working to receive a text message, and also have already set up your new handset and downloaded the <a href="https://ee.co.uk/ee-and-me/my-ee-app">My EE app</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’ve done that on your new phone in the My EE app, open the menu and go to Settings &gt; Device and SIM &gt; Replace my SIM &gt; and select your number.</p>
<p>You will then have two options on supporting devices, SIM card — Post (2 to 4 days) at a cost of £1.50. Or eSim — instant download at a cost of 50p.</p>
<p>Tap on eSim, then select this device, and you’ll be on your way to transferring your number.</p>

<p>You will then get a notification that the eSim is ready to download, and then you can go through the normal set up options. This gives you the facility to choose labels for the numbers, which iMessage number is used and lots of others. Once completed you will need to activate the new sim by receiving a text to your old phone, put the supplied code into the app on your new phone, and you’re ready to go.</p>
<p>This is usually instant but can take up to  an hour, turn your new phone off and on again to refresh everything, and you’re good to go on your new handset with a new EE eSim.</p>
<p>Head into Settings &gt; Mobile data to change any of the options you’re selected on set up. If in any doubt call 150 from a working EE phone.</p>

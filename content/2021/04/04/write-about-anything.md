<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I have seen people over the last few days start to wonder what to write about on their blog. Asking questions about the topics they cover and also publishing posts about <a href="https://chrishannah.me/the-evolution-of-what-i-write-about/">what they aim to do</a>. It’s great to see more people typing out words and realising that it really doesn’t matter what you write about.</p>
<p>Personal blogs are a strange thing, they are not new, they’ve been a round since pretty much the invention of the internet. For some reason or another they seem to be making a resurgence. Perhaps it’s the increased distrust in the places that bloggers left for, namely social media and others that aim to monetise you without paying you.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/075c937ade.jpg" /></p>
<p>It could be a concoction of many reasons. The positive is they are coming back. Sure, they have never gone away for many people, but lots more are opening up to the idea of publishing things themselves. So many great platforms exist now where you don’t need special skills to publish, and you don’t need to brand yourself either.</p>
<p>The need for a name or logo or fancy design is loosing its trend as publishing gains more relevance from your personal experience and your opinions. Citizen journalism has become immensely relevant as people lose confidence in main stream media, but are also becoming more closed off to outside ideas. So more people writing about more things and their personal experience of them can only lead to positive things.</p>
<p>Pick a platform and do it. Let me know what’s going on in your life, the pictures you take, the articles you read and the thoughts you have on them. There are enough publications out there writing news, or reviews or whatever pays the bills. The internet needs your voice, however you see fit to share it. Cover everything and anything and publish it.</p>

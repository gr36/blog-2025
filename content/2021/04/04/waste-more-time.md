<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Alan Lightman in his book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781501154362">In praise of wasting time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We in the “developed” world have created a frenzied lifestyle in which not a minute is to be wasted. The precious twenty-four hours of each day are carved up, dissected, and reduced to ten-minute units of efficiency.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The whole book plays on variations of this quote. Goes around the houses and through various anecdotes to instil in its readers that this notion we have of having to fill every waking minute of life with something is preposterous.</p>
<p>We are all guilty of this, and you can point fingers at all sorts of reasons. Capitalism, hustle porn, marketing and millions of other reasons, but is it time we realise it’s ok to <a href="https://gr36.com/2021/04/01/fast-moving-is.html">move slow</a>?</p>
<p>It’s ok to not be pushing things forward all the time and not have a side hustle to fill your life. Waste a bit of time and see what happens.</p>

<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I question almost everything about my life. Constantly wondering about each and everything I do and many things that I come into contact with. It’s one of the best and worst things about my brain, and for the past few months I’ve been thinking a lot about what I do and what I enjoy. This has led me to important discoveries, like my love of gaming, but also some questions writing and publishing online.</p>
<p>You see, my blog doesn’t really have a thing. It’s not tech-based like it used to be. It’s not really about anything in particular, which I am not really fussed about. It’s a personal blog, people read the personal bits of and follow along if they want. What matters more is the publishing part, putting those words out there and not keeping them in my brain.</p>
<p>I figured a long time ago I didn’t need a ‘thing’. I’m not a brand, nor do I want to sell myself or anything that I produce. So the argument arises what exactly the websites, social media things and blog I have are for? With a certain level of <a href="https://gr36.com/where-does-this-go/">where does this go mixed in</a>?</p>
<p>So I am getting a bit stuck and where micro.blog fits in. At the minute it’s getting a bit left out because although I check in a few times a day I’m not really publishing anything to it like I used to. The photo challenge really made me appreciate where I post my things online but that seems to have fallen away again.</p>
<p>I am leaning more towards just cross posting everything into micro.blog and checking in for the social aspect. I’d like to get this to a stage where it is my only blog but I just can’t work the design or ability to a stage where I am happy with everything. Having <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/03/22/ulysses-with-microblog.html">Ulysses now publish to pretty much everywhere</a> after my <a href="https://gr36.com/looking-for-my-perfect-app/">exploration of writing apps</a> complicated things tremendously.</p>

<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I want to try and keep a post or page updated with the tools I am using and apps I have installed. I gain so much insight into the ways others use their devices from <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/9126-2/">these types of posts</a> so it’s only fair I do the same.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/ce15871515.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Very little <a href="https://gr36.com/homescreen-january-2021/">ever changes about my phone</a> but the <a href="https://gr36.com/favourite-ios-apps/">apps sometimes revolve around</a>. At different times of the year different apps become more important. So new ones appear on my single homescreen and some drop off.</p>
<p>The apps I need access to can be split into four basic categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio – Podcasts have become a lot less important since COVID due to no commuting. I still listen to the occasional show whilst walking in Pocketcasts, but I’ve been consuming more audio books lately. </li>
<li>Reading – I <a href="https://gr36.com/my-reading-flow/">love reading</a> and my iPhone is one of the devices I use most as it’s always on me. Instead of <a href="https://gr36.com/twitter-muscle-memory/">scrolling Twitter</a> I now open up <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/reeder-5/id1529445840">Reeder</a> or Pocket and catch up on things.</li>
<li>Photos – I like to keep the camera and gallery app near by, at least until the <a href="https://gr36.com/the-iphone-needs-a-camera-button/">iPhone gets a camera button</a>!</li>
<li>Writing – everything goes in <a href="https://gr36.com/back-to-bear/">Bear</a> now. I’m slowly migrating away from using <a href="https://gr36.com/my-writing-workflow/">Roam</a> after falling out of love with it and wanting to spend less on digital services. It’s a great platform but it’s getting a bit lost and no proper app doesn’t help. </li>
</ul>
<p>I also have micro.blog as my main social media fix. I also find a lot to read here, as well as awesome photos. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wavelength-for-micro-blog/id1365158696">Wavelength</a> is something I am thinking of using to start a small podcast.</p>
<h2>Widgets</h2>
<p>I mainly use Reminders to store things I need to do. However I am looking at bringing back something more robust for projects — hence Todoist and Things installed currently.</p>
<p>The larger Headspace widget helps me remember to use it more often. I love meditation and it’s part of my <a href="https://gr36.com/2020-review/">2021 improvements</a> to do it more often. The rest are self explainatory, <a href="/categories/shortcuts/">Shortcuts</a> are always around here somewhere.</p>

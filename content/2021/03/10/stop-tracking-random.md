<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>David Nield <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-tell-which-emails-track-you/">gives some advice on email tracking and how to stop it</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Tracking pixels can report the times and dates their associated email was opened, as well as the location of the device used, and the email client involved. That’s a lot of data to feed back to a third-party that you might not know much about.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I knew these kind of things existed, but until I <a href="https://gr36.com/favourite-hey-features/">started using Hey</a> I never understood what an epidemic this is. Understanding your marketing data is absolutely essential, I have skin in that game. Analytics of mass emails is absolutely essential to filling your customers needs — but the current levels of usage is frankly ridiculous.</p>
<p>Why on earth do you need to track your newsletter? Yes I see you, attempting to see when I open and on what device for absolutely no reason other than your ego. Stop joining in with the attention economy to satisfy your own need for validation. I’ve subscribed, I read it, it’s great. Isn’t that enough?</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I kept control of <a href="https://gr36.com/greg-thinks-things-future/">my own emails</a> because services like Substack either don’t, or certainly don’t appear to, allow you to turn tracking off. Reporting back to a third party what <em>your</em> email subscribers are doing is doing yourself a disservice and letting your readers down. Tracking marketing and needing to see some return for your investment is one thing, but letting <em>someone else</em> collect data that you have no control over is another.</p>
<p>Hopefully we see the same attention to data collection we have seen in browsers extend to more email clients going forward.</p>

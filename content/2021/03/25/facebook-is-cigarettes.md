<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Make me smart with <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/make-me-smart-with-kai-and-molly/facebook-is-cigarettes/">Kai and Molly</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Facebook is cigarettes… It’s Big Tobacco… They know its product causes harm and they keep minimizing the harm to keep selling product.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As <a href="https://mariovillalobos.com/2021/03/12/am.html">Mario pointed out</a>, who brought this to me attention, there are 2 billion people addicted.</p>
<p>This is a perfect analogy. We know it’s bad for not only us personally, but also to society as a <em>whole</em>. Yet the addiction runs deep through the world. Of course nothing will ever happen to Facebook, it’s too popular, and makes too much money.</p>
<p>Maybe the best we can hope is that the people that do use it are a bit of an outcast and have to huddle around outside in the rain!</p>

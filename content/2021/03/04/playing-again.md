<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>This game has been the best one I have picked up in ages. Yes I am aware I keep banging on about it.</p>
<p>I donâ€™t play loads, I try and grab 20-30 minutes at a time on work breaks or in the evening but Iâ€™ve really enjoyed playing. Itâ€™s made me fall in love with gaming again, and because I can play Stadia anywhere it suits me perfectly. More than the Switch ever did, but Iâ€™m not quite sure why.</p>
<p>But playing again has meant I now allow myself to relax more and just chill when I always felt like I was wasting time before. Itâ€™s a mental swift that I really needed during lockdown and one I fell into by accident. ðŸŽ®</p>

<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It was by absolute chance that I remembered to post today’s blog post for the March blogging challenge. Even on the second day I almost didn’t make it to write out something, maybe I need to build this <a href="https://gr36.com/a-creature-of-habit/">into a routine</a>!</p>
<p>By pure luck I checked my RSS reader of choice (<a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> is the best) and I had at some point subscribed to the prompt feed. So, as luck would have it, the gods of chance were on my side. Otherwise I would have completely forgotten, as I did for the first week of the <a href="https://micro.welltempered.net/2021/01/30/february-photoblogging-challenge.html">February photo</a> posts!</p>
<p>I am not usually a lucky person, I’ve never won a lottery, nor any prizes I think ever. I often question what I did in a former life to be blessed with such lack of luck, but I have two beautiful kids and a nice house so I guess if life <em>is</em> a game of chance I am doing pretty well out of it. I could never consider myself completely unlucky, but in things that rely on a chance, the ball never falls in my court.</p>
<p>So today’s post is a little smaller than I would have liked because it is rushed between doing so many things. I won’t leave the other ones to chance and try and set up something to remind me earlier in the day.</p>

<p>This post was Day 2 of the <a href="https://dailybloggingchallenge.com/">March Daily Blogging Challenge</a> , and the prompt is : <a href="https://dailybloggingchallenge.com/03/02/march-02-2021-chance/">Chance</a>.</p>

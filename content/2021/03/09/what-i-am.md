<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>At this point in my life I am not sure I can ever sleep without first turning a few digital pages. It’s a while since I bought a physical book, but pulling out my kindle to unwind is one of my favourite activities.</p>
<p>Reading in general consumes some time almost every day. It might be <a href="https://getpocket.com/@gr36">articles saved in to Pocket</a>, or my current book of choice, I love nothing more than quietness and words on a page. As I’ve <a href="https://gr36.com/my-reading-flow/">written about previously</a>, I usually have at least a couple of books on the go at once for different points in the day. What I’m looking forward to going forward is logging these books and making some recommendations. <a href="https://micro.blog/books/search">Micro.blog does this really well</a> and I’ve set up <a href="/categories/books/">a page</a> to show them all.</p>

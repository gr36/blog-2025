<blockquote><p>
  Everything from everyone all the time is too much. It’s unnatural and it’s unhealthy. We weren’t built to listen to hundreds if not thousands of people every day.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes regular things to everyone else are overwhelming to others. Every time I try and explain how I feel to others they pooh-Pooh what I am saying because they don’t see an issue. That’s great to hear, but something has changed in me and I don’t want more of anything. I want less.</p>
<p>I want to know less, consume less and take in less information. I’m not built to have access to all of these people at once, and I can’t be trusted.</p>

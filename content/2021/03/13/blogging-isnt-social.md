<p>I get it, hype <a href="/2021/03/10/digital-consumerism-and.html">sells things</a>. You have to talk a good talk and apparently pick a fight with everything and everyone. This time is blogging, that apparently Hey World has fixed.</p>
<p>My eyes rolled so hard that I got a bit dizzy from the stupidness of this statement. Blogging has absolutely nothing to do with follows or likes so promising to fix two things that are not an issue when publishing a post on a blog is weird.</p>
<p>Sharing it to social media and getting views, maybe. But that has nothing to do with where or how you publish to your blog.</p>

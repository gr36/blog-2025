<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Joe <a href="https://postedlife.com/2021/03/18/hardly-any-positive.html">on trying to remain positive all the time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Right now I am struggling with having positive thoughts. I want to get away from the eternal only fighting problems. I can’t. I can’t think of anything. Yes, I know… my family is healthy, I have a nice apartment and so on. There is enough. But that doesn’t distract me.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t know what it is recently but I feel exactly the same. Since January I’ve really struggled to get back to anywhere near myself.</p>
<p>I have found myself reacting poorly to stimulus, dwelling on negative thoughts and just not being my positive self. I feel a million miles away from where I was this time last year and there is no end in sight.</p>
<p>I know it’s perfectly fine to not be ok, but it’s hard to not share your negativity online.</p>

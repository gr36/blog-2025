<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I find it interesting looking at others Homescreens. It shows me a lot about how they use their phone, even more so now Apple allows an extra layer of customisation thanks to widgets.</p>
<p>It’s also a great way to learn about new apps and see some amazing wallpapers. So here mine!</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2024/ba72360afc.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I don’t have many apps installed at all and always keep my homescreen icons down to a minimum. Widgets are becoming much more useful so I have quite a few in the side page, but only ever a couple on my actual homescreen for information I need in my face.</p>
<p><em>Note: I have no idea where I got the wallpaper from so it’s not fair of me to share without credit. If I do ever find it again I’ll update the post.</em></p>

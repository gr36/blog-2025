<p>After denying it for quite a while, I succumbed to getting myself a third-party mouse, and you can’t buy anything other than the <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/mx-master-review/">MX Master 3</a>. It’s more comfortable, more accurate and is packed full of power user features that allow you to mould its usage to your will. There is one small issue though, every so often an update comes around which causes the mouse to freeze and disconnect at random intervals — but here’s the fix.</p><p>If you have this issue, each time the MX Master 3 freezes up you will notice random Bluetooth devices connect and disconnect before disappearing. This happens at random intervals and lasts for anywhere between a few seconds up to a minute. All the time you will be unable to use the mouse. It looks something like this.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="uploads/2024/626d5000f0.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" /></figure><p>The issue stems from Apples use of hand off. An amazing feature that allows you to move seamlessly from device to device with minimal fuss — but also with a tendency to break things that don’t work with it. If you’ve got your mouse paired to more than one device using the same iCloud, Apple is trying to sync them across all of them and failing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="750" height="188" frameborder="0" src="https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-8335452151565777&output=html&h=188&slotname=5524743860&adk=3000940899&adf=1057741593&pi=t.ma~as.5524743860&w=750&fwrn=4&lmt=1636365897&rafmt=11&psa=0&format=750x188&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgregmorris.co.uk%2Fblog%2Fmx-master-freezing%2F&flash=0&wgl=1&dt=1636365896905&bpp=10&bdt=28&idt=58&shv=r20211103&mjsv=m202111030101&ptt=9&saldr=aa&abxe=1&cookie=ID%3D624289800618cd6a-2205bf5cdacc0058%3AT%3D1636364026%3ART%3D1636364026%3AS%3DALNI_MaK4ep4hjl4TBG5SsfZqenP5X_i-Q&prev_fmts=0x0&nras=1&correlator=7511213397426&frm=20&pv=1&ga_vid=2046011996.1636364022&ga_sid=1636365897&ga_hid=708583389&ga_fc=1&rplot=4&u_tz=0&u_his=2&u_h=1440&u_w=2560&u_ah=1415&u_aw=2560&u_cd=24&adx=277&ady=969&biw=1304&bih=1210&scr_x=0&scr_y=0&eid=31063355%2C31063361%2C31063426&oid=2&pvsid=580926662659406&pem=271&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fgregmorris.co.uk%2Fghost%2F&eae=0&fc=1920&brdim=80%2C150%2C80%2C150%2C2560%2C25%2C1319%2C1290%2C1319%2C1210&vis=1&rsz=%7C%7CeE%7C&abl=CS&pfx=0&fu=128&bc=31&ifi=2&uci=a!2&fsb=1&xpc=UsfMDdvhpv&p=https%3A//gregmorris.co.uk&dtd=237" allowfullscreen="true" data-google-container-id="a!2"></iframe></figure><p>The MX Master supports up to three devices with the click of a button, so I have no idea why iCloud is trying to do this, but they broke it nonetheless.

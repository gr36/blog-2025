<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p style="text-align: left">This is one of my most used Shortcuts now I have <a href="https://gr36.com/i-didnt-want-to-move/">removed posting friction</a> and settled a little. Shortcuts is a really robust way to publish to WordPress and not have to use the WordPress app or third party app.</p>
<p><!--more-->This isnâ€™t all of my work, and all the technical stuff was done by Tim Nahumck in his <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-4-siri-shortcuts-wordpress-and-more/">drafts review</a> it just needed updating and tweaking a little as Shortcuts evolves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3dc5536449a140ba92767041ad2608fb">Grab It</a></p>
<p>You can write a post in pretty much any app you have now. Use Markdown format though as the shortcut looks for # to set the title and removes all this for you. See my screen shots for an example of my Apple Notes publishing.</p>

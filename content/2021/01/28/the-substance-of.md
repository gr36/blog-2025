<blockquote><p>
  All my life I have had the habit of liking the idea of things and not the thing itself.
</p></blockquote>
<p>How many of us want to be someone that does x but don’t want to actually do x. It could be writing, running or just being a happy person. It doesn’t matter what it is, the thought of it is often more enjoyable that the thing itself.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I didn’t want to be doing, I wanted to be done, so that when I was done, I could say I did a thing. – <a href="https://longreads.com/2020/09/08/out-there-on-not-finishing/">Out There: On Not Finishing</a>

<p>The stories we tell of the things we do, the things we enjoy and the memories we have made are at the very core of life. Some TV shows are funnier when talking about them with your friends. Hardships something far more positive when recalling them after the event.</p>
<p>The stories are the very substance and the reason to do things.</p>

<p>It has been a while since I have been genuinely excited to dive into a new app. After my initial trepidation, and following the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/">massive buzz</a> around the 5th instalment of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Drafts app</a>, I <a href="/2018/04/21/drafts-updatei-must.html">decided to give it a chance</a> and I am so glad I did.</p><p>I have tried Drafts 4 a few times when interesting things come up, these things more often than not involve <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">Viticci</a> et al discussing it’s merits. Yet for some reason I just never really ‘got it’ – it is a powerful enough app but I couldn’t find a use case for it when compared to <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-08-02-bear-and-ulysses/">Ulysses</a> or <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-01-19-bear-app-review/">Bear</a>. After only a few hours of really using the app, and intensifying after a few days, I went though a transition that has affected my relationship with writing text altogether.</p><p>By using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">Drafts</a> I no longer need to decide where the text I wish to write needs to go. Drafts has become a place for notes, reminders, blog posts and everything in between. All powered by the single biggest selling point of this app – Actions.</p><p>By building up an arsenal of actions I can now place any text I need to type down where I need it to go. Whereas previously before typing any text in I had to decide if it was a note, blog post, tweet – whatever it was – I had to spend brain power deciding where to put it. Things I need to remember when talking to someone, blog post ideas, long emails I’m mulling over, absolutely everything goes into drafts to be distributed later on.</p><p>The <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/">actions directory</a> has provided me with a whole range of abilities, or inspiration to write my own, integrating with a huge range of services. I have an action to <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1EN">create a Todoist item</a>, post to <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Dj">micro blog</a>, place the <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1GO">front matter into my post and save to my github</a>, and loads more. If I start a blog post now and it doesn’t quite make the mark I can post it to microblog instead. Or a short link post might turn into a full on post, I don’t need different apps doing different things any longer.</p><p>Drafts has enabled me to publish much more just by simplifying my workflow. Add this to the brilliant markdown keyboard functions, fast and fluid app and much better design, I am so happy I gave Drafts a chance. Grab it <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;at=1000ltj4">from the app store</a> and find a use case for it, it might just change your outlook.</p>

<p>As I work on producing more and more podcast audio headphones are becoming one of the most important things in my tech arsenal. My trusty wood backed over ear wired headphones that I have been using since EuroTech Talk (I have no idea what they are they came free with a subscription to wired) are no longer cutting it.</p>
<p>My requirements are as much noise cancelling as possible, a wired connection for the times I’m using a mixer, and most importantly they must be over ear. I’ve used some <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beats-Dr-Dre-Wireless-Headphones-Black/dp/B01LW0M4J1/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521882178&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=solo+3&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=a876c4c968415aac9658e0cce98feb52">Beats Solo3</a> for a while and due to being on ear they are uncomfortable after an hour or so of use.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of models that fit into this category, with price tags anywhere from just over £100 to north of £500. Almost all of these, there are considered to be 3-4 leaders, and hundreds of reviews comparing them all together. Most people give the nod to the Sony WH-1000X closely followed by the stalwart of any long haul flight the Bose QC.</p>
<p>Yet as much as I know that the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-WH-1000XM2-Cancelling-Resolution-Recognition-Black/dp/B074ZRG5MN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521881813&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sony+1000xm2&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=1d3870b83c3e3f092a00db5a8ea802a9">Sony WH-1000XM2</a>, or equally the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B01E3SNO1G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521881787&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=BOse+QC35&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=7c0d32d221b6eb1d208501606080b5fd">Bose QuietComfort 35</a> or the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sennheiser-PXC-550-Wireless-Cancelling-Black/dp/B01E3XLNA0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521881730&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Sennheiser+PXC+550&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=e4cc1101fde208a3a4a5290d7e15b438">Sennheiser PXC 550</a> are the much better choice for sound. Any headphones produced with the W chip in must become a consideration – so I must also take into account the Beats Studio 3 simply because they are so easy to use.</p>
<p>Many times I have used my AirPods to walk down the gym, and switched to my <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beats-Dr-Dre-BeatsX-Earphones-Black/dp/B01LW9IKX7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521884335&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=beats+x&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=265528e898c78c9ed48651da32c1d568">Beats X</a> or Solo3 for working out without missing a single beat. Many people dismiss the Beats headphones as sounding overly bass heavy, but more modern versions are better, and I can forgive this if I don’t have to fiddle with the Bluetooth connection screen for 5 minutes before each use.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B01E3SNO1G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1521881787&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=BOse+QC35&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=gr36-21&amp;linkId=7c0d32d221b6eb1d208501606080b5fd">Bose QC35ii</a> even have a ‘Google Assistant button’ which is pretty much useless when using an iPhone. This is no fault of Google assistant, or Bose, but Apple Music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YKe2nndGUc">music controls are extremely limited</a>. The smartphone wars are now extending towards headphone manufactures and car companies, what a time to be alive.</p>
<p>Ultimately I wanted something comfortable and ’neutral’ sounding so I went with the Bose (my personal preference), but it just shows what a difference the W chips have made. If they were not installed in the Beats range they wouldn’t even be in the conversation.</p>

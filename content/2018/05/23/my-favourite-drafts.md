<p>Despite <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?at=1000ltj4">Drafts</a> being around for ages, I am very new to using it for any length of time. I’ve already posted about my <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-04-29-finding-use-for-drafts/">love of the app after giving it a chance</a>, so I won’t go into that here but thought I’d share some of my most used and favourite actions.</p>
<h2>Send to Things</h2>
<p>I really don’t need to discuss my love of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743?at=1000ltj4">Things</a> here again, do I? This action enables me to write multiple todos and pass them all to Things at once. Saves loads of time for planning a project or if you take meeting action notes like I do.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Cc">Install</a></p>
<h2>Post to Micro.blog</h2>
<p>The greatest thing about Drafts is the fact I start absolutely every bit of text in the app and then pass it to its destination. I start all writing here and if it is long enough or good enough I post to my blog, if not I use this action to post to micro.blog with ease.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Hg">Install</a></p>
<h2>Send To Bear</h2>
<p>My longer notes or <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-05-15-workflow-things-attachments-using-bear/">lengthy attachments to Things</a> todo items are stored in <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-01-19-bear-app-review/">Bear</a>. This action does exactly what it says, passes all text to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bear/id1016366447?at=1000ltj4">Bear</a> and creates a new note.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CZ">Install</a></p>
<h2>Post To My Blog</h2>
<p>Should the text I’m writing be deemed worthy I post it to my blog hosted on github using Jekyll. In order to do this it needs to have the correct front matter and then be pushed to github using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/working-copy/id896694807?at=1000ltj4">Working Copy</a>. This action does all of that in one tap. I have several of these for posting to different parts of my blog.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1GO">Install</a></p>
<h2>Covert To HTML</h2>
<p>I quite often write columns for <a href="http://eepurl.com/dvApEj">newsletters</a> or websites that require me to send it across in HTML. Or perhaps I just want to see what the page I’m building is going to look like. Whatever the reason this action turns markdown into HTML.</p>
<p><a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Eb">Install</a></p>
<h2>Do More..</h2>
<p>There are hundreds more that I could mention but these are my most used ones. Matt Birchler has also <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/draft-5-actions-the-birchtree-collection/">created some really good ones himself</a> and helped out with the post to micro.blog action above. Drafts has become my favourite app and does most of what I used workflow for. I’d love to know your favourite.</p>

It’s become a bit of a running joke amongst my tech friends. A personal meme that I keep repeating the same sort of phase when questioned about a whole range of topics. Anything from GDPR to Social Media harassment my answer – [micro.blog}().

Many people don’t understand. I’ve tried and failed to explain why micro.blog matters in a world of Twitter, Facebook and countless blogging platforms. A few have converted and love it, and a few have tried and given up (and [given me some stick](https://darylbaxter.micro.blog/). My biggest take away from all the jokes is that the platform is not for everyone and that’s ok.

This post started off as a bit of a joke, but there is a sensible point in here somewhere. We all preach about things that we love, hell most of Twitter is people doing exactly that. It may be the latest bit of technology you’ve bought and think everyone should have one. It might be your choice of religion and you want to express all of the benefits it will give you in this life and the next. Or it might just be a new(ish) publishing platform that gets you [away from social media](/2018/05/25/intentional-twitter-usage.html) a little and gives you a place to publish the writing that doesn’t quite make it to your blog.

Remember when I thought Medium was the best thing since sliced bread, that lasted quite a while and look how that ended up! You are all just going to have to weather the storm until I find something else to get obsessed with. I’m sure there is a start up out there planning to “make a difference to the world” and they should be along shortly.

<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>I remember getting my very first Android phone. After using iPhones for a very long time I switched to the new comer in town. The Galaxy S was shiny and new, and all I had to worry about was putting my sim in and transferring my contacts. I felt like I was some kind of rebel, sporting an underdog and not conforming to convention.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, even transferring contacts was pretty tricky at the time as Apple were even more locked down that they are now and I opted to just write them all down and type them back in. This was the most complicated part of the process, but these simple days are long gone. You must have a serious desire to reach escape velocity now, and it feels a little bit claustrophobic.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>App Investment</strong></strong></h2>
<p>After even a small amount of time spent using iOS there can be a considerable investment in applications. The average spend on iOS users in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/21/iphone-average-app-spending-2016/">US is $40 a year</a>, all of this investment is useless when switching to a different OS. Several apps have introduced subscription services that will in theory work cross platform, this will help to mediate those issues. However there is no guarantee that there is even apps available on alternative platforms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately many of the high profile applications that have adopted this model are simply not available on other platforms. Granted the average Joe may have nothing to worry about other than than their phone. However more and more people are buying Apple Watches, iPads and Apple TVs than you think. These are satellite devices to everyone and all aid to keep customers from leaving.</p>
<p>No longer is the only investment a mobile phone and perhaps a few accessories. Manufacturers are creating a whole range of devices with different levels of pull, designed to make the overall experience as good as possible. It is without doubt that certain devices have more pull than other devices – higher gravity if you will. So reaching that escape velocity from iOS is much harder when you take into account everything that goes with it. Arguably I would miss the connivence of AirPods and the ease of a cellular Apple Watch (these are my favourite Apple devices over the last few years) more than an iPhone.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only option is just accept my fate <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/leaning-into-the-apple-lock-in/">and lean in</a>? I have already embraced the fact that unless something drastic changes it would be almost impossible for me to switch <em><em>everything</em></em> but not impossible for me to change some things. The trick is to not let the brand overtake your opinions, I try very hard to be open to changing and neutral in my opinions. Event though I live the Mac life doesn’t mean opinions should be influenced – although not being a <a href="https://gr36.com/2017-10-25-not-being-a-fan-boy-is-hard/">fan boy is really hard</a>!</p>

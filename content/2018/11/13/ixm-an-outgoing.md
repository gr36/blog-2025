<p>I have no issue with sharing myself and my life in person or online. I have a job in sales, I podcast all the time, yet there is something you may not know about me – I am actually really introverted.</p>
<p>Much much less than I used to be, but it seems to be hard for people to wrap their head around it. I am sure many people would label me as much more outgoing than I actually am, and I used to worry about it quite a lot.</p>
<p>I have what I describe as an extrovert battery, and it only lasts so long. I spend <a href="https://gr36.com/2018-10-28-too-much-time-alone/">lots of my time alone</a> preparing for the times I need to be more social. I haven’t quite got the time frame down yet, but when working for long periods or spending lots of time with others, around late afternoon I start to flag.</p>
<blockquote><p>Introverts get their energy by being alone or in small groups, while extroverts get their energy from larger groups of people. – <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147750/social-anxiety-psychology-how-to-be-yourself-ellen-hendriksen-interview">Ellen Hendriksen</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I didn’t even realise this was normal until very recently. I thought introverts were those that shy away from everything and were a little socially awkward. Personality traits are often miss understood like this, but all I know is that I feel drained and often need some quiet time to simply recharge.</p>
<p>I thrive in peace and quiet where I can focus, but love interacting with others and conversing. I’m perfectly happy being the centre of attention, but not for too long and providing I get some down time. I guess I need to look after my little extrovert battery, make sure it goes through it’s charge cycles correctly and preserve its longevity.</p>

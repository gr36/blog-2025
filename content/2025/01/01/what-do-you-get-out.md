Manuel Moreale writing [Kindness in a transactional world](https://manuelmoreale.com/@/page/stVqZccByYVbTemk)

> Kindness is the reason why I’m doing this. There’s no other reason. I don’t care about getting a reward. I care about showing people that in this stupid transactional world, we can still be kind to one another. We can still help someone, even if we’ll get nothing in return.

Manuel’s posts are some of my favourite to read online. Through provoking, and revolving around pushing to the web. So I may find references to his work all over my blog because of how similar they feel to my thoughts. Particularly when it comes to writing and publishing for free.

Getting paid for doing something you enjoy is every person’s dream, yet when I think about getting paid for writing online, I would dread it. I enjoy it much more when my motivation is just for the fun of it. To be kind and put out my thoughts, ideas, and solutions to problems into the world and hope they help someone in a similar position.

As I have written before, I see my place in this world as [being for others](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2023/02/03/im-here-for.html). I *always* [put myself last](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/03/08/my-enjoyment-is.html), and I am perfectly fine with doing so because the things I do are because I like being kind. I want my actions to show that in a world that seems to value return on investment and monitoring even part of your life, you don’t need to live like that.

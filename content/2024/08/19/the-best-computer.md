Cole blogging about [writing on their iPhone](https://coleb.blog/posts/blogging-from-my-iphone): 

> Using my iPhone to write blog posts feels more casual and personable. It’s like drafting a note to a friend or texting them about the latest happenings.

I am often down on smartphones. If I had a *real* choice, I wouldn’t have one, yet it is by far the best computer I have. Like Cole above, I use mine for writing the majority of my blog posts, and catching up on my favourite things on the web. It is my [creative computer](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/04/01/creative-computer-in.html).

Writing on my iPhone doesn’t feel the same as sitting down and writing at my desk — that feels like I am working. Whereas typing out some thoughts in between life events feels like I am texting to a friend, which in many ways I am — all of you.

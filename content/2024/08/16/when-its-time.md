Matt Birchler [writing about his feeling from incident the Apple “cult”](https://birchtree.me/blog/is-this-the-slow-decline-of-the-apple-cult/): 

> I do wonder if the Apple enthusiast crowd as we know is in permanent decline. You don’t need Daring Fireball, Panic, ATP, Birchtree, or anyone else like us to be massively financially successful (just look at Microsoft and Samsung), but I do find it a bit sad to see Apple stroll down the road to being a totally heartless mega corp like the rest

I’m starting to feel this too. I’m uncomfortable how Apple is increasingly focusing on income, despite being one of the riches on the planet, instead of its users.

I am beginning to feel squeezed for every penny, increasing prices of phones, services, and everything they can. Limiting features to the US and generally [behaving like a petulant child](https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/eu-competition-commissioner-says-apples-decision-to-pull-ai-from-eu-shows-anticompetitive-behavior/) when they have to comply with laws that protect users.

I have long grown tired of the Apple apologists that try and to explain away every decision apple makes, yet many of them are even quiet at the company Apple has become. Every time new Pixel phones come around I toy with the idea of using something different, I ultimately won’t due to my love of the Mac and Apple Watch, but mainly because I don’t trust Google either!

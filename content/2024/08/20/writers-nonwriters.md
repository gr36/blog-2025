Seth Godin writing about [the need to be clear in concise in your writing](https://seths.blog/2024/08/non-professional-writers/), even if you don’t consider yourself a writer:

> Nobody asks you to design a bridge, write a sonnet or do open heart surgery. We leave these essential tasks to trained professionals. But many job descriptions carry the unstated addendum, “and write.” Write memos, proposals, and even instruction manuals.

One of the overriding things that I experience in my everyday life is the idea that everyone can write, or no one can write. They seem like conflicting ideas however they both fit together and get to the same point.

The non-writer is one that outputs words into whatever medium they are completing. Be it a memo, email, business plan or even a simple sign. They don’t worry about what they output because they are “not a writer” and don’t view these things as important.

The person who thinks everyone can write does the same because they do not understand the importance of written communication. They dismiss the importance of clear and concise writing and overestimate their own skills.

That isn’t to say I am any kind of expert in this field, but I have written enough words over more than a decade to give every single word the consideration it needs. I am also comfortable knowing where my skills end. Either that or I do as Seth suggest, place my words into an LLM and ask it to be clear and concise on my behalf.

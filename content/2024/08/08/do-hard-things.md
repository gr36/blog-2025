Jarrod Blundy writing in [You (And I) Can Do Hard Things](https://heydingus.net/blog/2024/8/you-and-i-can-do-hard-things)

> Doing the hard thing isn’t always fun. It’s often not the thing you want to do. There may be many reasons for you not to do the hard thing. But there’s almost always a good reason that you should do the hard thing. And I hope you remember that you can.

A few months ago [I read](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/05/06/finished-reading-the.html) [The Comfort Crisis](https://micro.blog/books/9780593138779) by Michael Easter, and it introduced the concept of misogi. An ancient Japanese practice of doing really, really hard things. There perhaps should be another really in there because this hard thing should push you to your limits and have at most a 50/50 chance of being achievable.

In doing so you are said to reach a state of sumikiri — complete clarity of body and mind. This all seems a bit out there, I admit, but by doing really hard things you achieve the mythical ‘flow state’. One that [Csikszentmihalyi](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/flow-theory#:~:text=Flow%20theory%20proposed%20by%20Csikszentmihalyi,and%20feelings%20are%20pushed%20aside.) describes as “making life more rich, intense and meaningful”. Indeed, as covered in the book, people are physically harder, mentally tougher and on sounder footing spiritually when they experience discomfort.

So yes, you *can* do hard things, and you *should* do hard things — and you will be better off for it.

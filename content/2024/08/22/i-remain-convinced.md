I remain convinced that the only thing [The Verge is mad at](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24224084/google-pixel-9-reimagine-ai-photos) with Pixel phones is that 'normal people' can alter images now. At times it feels like the stamping of feet because they spent time learning Photoshop and now everyone can do it.

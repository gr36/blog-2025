My *very* early impressions of the Boox Palma after using it for [a couple of days](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/08/24/ive-conceded-to.html) are positive.

I'm not blown away by it, I think it's a bit expensive for what it is, but I can see why people love it and how it would fit into my life. I can only describe it as if an iPod had a baby with a Kindle.

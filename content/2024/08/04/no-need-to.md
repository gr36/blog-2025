Kev Quirk writing in [Three Years With My M1 MacBook Air](https://kevquirk.com/blog/three-years-with-my-m1-macbook-air)

> Question is, will I upgrade? Well, no. Not any time soon anyway. The M1 Air still does everything I need it to extremely well. So why upgrade? Why drop another £1,000 or so on the latest version of the Air? Because it looks a little nicer? Because it comes in blue? Because the chipset is 2 increments better? Nah, I'll stick with this workhorse until it dies.

I’m not sure if it is them M1 chip, but around this time my motivation to upgrade so often seems to have disappeared. It was such a revolution in power and efficiency that the following iterations do not receive anywhere near the attention—which is great.

I’d love to see Apple do something more with their laptop and push the design forward. Perhaps a really thin and light device for ultra portability because to be honest, the battery life of MacBooks is a little insane now!

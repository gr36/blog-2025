Matteo Wong writing [another great summary](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/07/ai-companies-unprofitable/679278/) of the data surrounding AI failure to return on investment:

> Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs’s head of global equity research, told me, “If we’re going to justify a trillion or more dollars of investment, AI needs to solve complex problems and enable us to do things we haven’t been able to do before.”

I am starting to think that big tech companies are just a long line of bubbles. Create a buzz around something (blockchain, NFT, Ai, whatever )get loads of investment and wait for the pop.

Don’t worry though because they can just pivot and stuff the next big thing into their apps and raise another round of investment.

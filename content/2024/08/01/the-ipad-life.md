Perhaps not all of us, but for many people who are interested in tech, and particularly bloggers, the allure of being able to use a tablet to get things done is a strong one. I’ve been there, realised that I can’t make it do what I want, yet always have one hanging around. Here I am, once again, writing on an iPad Pro—and these words are nothing more than to justify my expenditure! 

There was only a minimal time I didn’t have an iPad at all. Despite it leaving [quite dramatically](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2019/11/03/today-is-the.html), soon returning in the form of a 2018 iPad Pro that I had until recently. It was often [my creative computer](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/18/all-work-and.html), but one that came in and out of my life whilst [expecting nothing in return](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2022/08/26/the-quiet-and.html). I’ve bought and sold ‘better’ iPads alongside this one, but expected too much from them. Whereas my 2018 version was worth more to me than anyone else, and suck around when all others failed.

Unfortunately, it finally [gave up the ghost](https://gregmorris.photo/2024/07/24/need-to-upgrade.html), so I began looking around for a replacement. To be honest, I wanted another 2018 version but, whilst being very cheap, they run the risk of dying the same as my old one. I should have taken Mere Civilian’s [advice](https://merecivilian.com/why-did-i-buy-the-m2-ipad-pro-instead-of-the-m4/) and picked up a M2 version, but there was something about the new M4’s that appealed to me. Not because of the power, but because of the nice screen and slimmed down weight.

So, I am sitting here, typing this out on an 11” m4, with an Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard. I got it very lightly used, after trying a 13” version first that didn’t fit my workflow, and traded in numerous bits of tech that were no longer needed. There are trade off here. The keyboard is a little too small, the size isn’t as good for drawing as the larger version, but it fits better into my life being more portable.

I don’t for one second think that many people should buy these new iPads unless you get a good deal. They are expensive and are in many ways complete overkill, but I’m enjoying having an iPad back in my life after even just a few weeks away.

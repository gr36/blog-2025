My superpower is thinking too much about the things I do and the choices I make. I used to think this was a hindrance because it sometimes stoped me acting quickly and getting things done faster than should. Or spending too much time worrying about things that didn’t need so much dwelling on. However, I do believe that you should be questioning yourself more than any other person could because it will give you strength in your convictions.

During my working life, I have come across many individuals that constantly question others. Both from a position of authority, and not. They require no other reason to question things and rubbish the ideas than the simple fact it did not come from themselves. You can segregate those people from those that have legitimate concerns by simply testing them on their decisions. Those that have logically made their decisions can back up their worries with sound judgement, and not simply “I think”.

This kind of mental questioning should happen in yourself when decisions arise. You should examine every angle, come up with ways it could fall down, and alternative solutions. Ensuring the motivation and the execution are sound, and at this point you will be able to defeated your position, if only to yourself. Giving you the confidence to continue on the path you have chosen, until you come across new information or evidence to the contrary.

There is a limit, of course. By constantly testing everything around you, it sometimes feels as if you are building the anxiety in your brain for no good reason. There are life choices and decisions that don’t need to be tested to extremes, merely weighed up with the information you have instantly available. Done so in a time frame that gives the required space it needs and no more. 

Questioning yourself isn’t a sign of weakness, it builds resilience. When you evaluate your choices and motivations critically, you become more adaptable to change and better prepared for challenges. By regularly questioning your actions and beliefs, you can find areas to improve and understand yourself better. Embrace this superpower, balance it with practicality, and you’ll make better decisions and navigate life’s complexities more confidently.

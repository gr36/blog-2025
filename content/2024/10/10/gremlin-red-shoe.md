Gremlin Red Shoe in [Blog monetization rush is so annoying](https://gremlin.bearblog.dev/blog-monetization-rush-is-so-annoying/)
> We need to take blogging back to its original indie web form and meaning. Join Bear, Neocity or make your own personal website about the stuff you like.


Or indeed micro.blog. 

Not everything needs to be monetised or growth hacked. Just blog. Read other blogs. And then blog about their posts too.

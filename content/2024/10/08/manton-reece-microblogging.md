[Manton Reece - Microblogging, a fable](https://www.manton.org/2024/10/08/an-only-slightly.html)

> The point is not to replace Twitter, but to have a space that is rooted in the open web, with just the right balance between blogging at your own domain name and being social with others.

You may know, I have left here twice now, but due to other frustrations. However every time I do, I realise what a fantastic service it is. 

Some may not see the point, and thatâ€™s ok. Micro.blog has its faults, it has too high bar to entry for some, but it offers me a gateway to the web and ease of posting that I **really** value.

Let’s just say it: there is no new iPhone. Every September, Apple rolls out the red carpet, the tech world holds its breath, and yet here we are, staring at what feels like the same device dressed in slightly different clothing. Sure, the branding is slick, the presentations are polished, and the new models are undoubtedly beautiful—but where’s the excitement? Where’s the innovation? Perhaps [another button](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/09/08/the-no-action.html)? 

I remember when getting a new iPhone felt like stepping into the future. Each launch brought with it a sense of wonder, of discovery, of something genuinely new. But now? We’re left squinting at spec sheets, trying to figure out what’s actually different. A slightly better camera? A marginally faster processor? A new colour option? It feels like we’ve seen it all before because, well, we have.

The truth is, the iPhone has become a victim of its success. Apple has run out of real ideas and is simply pandering to share prices. Caught in a cycle of incremental upgrades. Every year, a new model that’s a little better, a little faster, a little shinier. These are not the leaps we once saw, they’re baby steps. And while those steps are nice, they’re not enough to make anything like a new iPhone.

These so-called “innovations” often feel like they’re being held back purposefully, just so Apple can have something to sell us next year. The camera could be better, but it’s good enough for now. The battery could last longer, but we’ll save that for the next model. It’s a strategy that’s great for Apple’s bottom line, but not so great for those of us who remember when each new iPhone truly felt like a worthwhile expenditure.

Don’t get me wrong—the iPhone is still one of the best smartphones out there, and I will no doubt end up buying one. But if you’re looking for something new, something that’s going to make you sit up and take notice, you won’t find it here. The iPhone has settled into a comfortable groove, and maybe that’s fine. But I miss the days when a new iPhone felt like a revolution, it’s hard not to feel a little disappointed.

There is no new iPhone announced today. Just the same iPhone with as little done to it as possible to maximise profits.

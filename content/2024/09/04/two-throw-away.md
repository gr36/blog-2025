Two throw away images I took playing around with exposure priority settings. They came out pretty good 

<div class="gallery">
<img src="uploads/2024/8b94b864-ec8b-482e-a4c1-eca7c9df4e54.jpg" width="1800" height="1200" alt="Silhouettes of a man and a woman walking past a window with closed curtains in the background. The image has strong contrast with light coming from above, creating a shadowed foreground." />

<img src="uploads/2024/9940f4f1-c0cb-4a48-87f1-4c4ee1747675.jpg" width="1800" height="1200" alt="Silhouettes of two individuals walking in front of a window with closed curtains. The person in the foreground appears to be smoking, while the person behind is holding what seems to be a child or a large stuffed animal. The image is taken in lower" />

Matt Birchler on [the 99% of people lie](https://birchtree.me/blog/the-nobody-buys-a-new-iphone-every-year-lie/): 

> People have a terrible habit of assuming “everyone” does something, when that’s simply not the case.

Everyone thinks that their perception of the world is correct. It’s only when you begin to realise that the way you look at things is nothing more than your perspective that it becomes infinitely more valuable.

The best thinkers can see things from other angles and come to open conclusions with the confidence to both defend their position and be open to new ideas.

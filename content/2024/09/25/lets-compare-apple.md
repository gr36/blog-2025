> Actually, there is no such thing as a real picture. As soon as you have sensors to capture something, you reproduce [what youâ€™re seeing], and it doesnâ€™t mean anything. There is no real picture. You can try to define a real picture by saying, â€˜I took that pictureâ€™, but if you used AI to optimize the zoom, the autofocus, the scene â€” is it real? Or is it all filters? There is no real picture, full stop.

Iâ€™m sorry. What gibberish is this?

 [On the iPhone 16 Pro's cameras â€” aows](https://aows.co/blog/2024/9/11/on-the-iphone-16-pros-cameras)

> I said it a year ago, and I still think Apple made a mistake with the 120mm lens. The current lineup of 13mm, 24mm, and 120mm leaves a huge gap between the main and telephoto lenses, missing out on key and very useful focal lengths for everyday situations. I'd rather see a 75mm lens on a 48MP sensor, with the ability to reach 120mm using the fancy cropping the main sensor has.

This is what I expected to see on the Pro Max this year. Alas, they've kept it back to roll out the revolution next time.

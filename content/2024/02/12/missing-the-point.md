It seems my throwaway post about [not publishing to my blog](/2024/02/09/self-censoring.html) gained some traction. Many people took it as it was intended, a commentary on it being too easy to reply and push it in front of my face, but many more people did not. 

It’s a shame to see it used as some kind of signifier of privilege. Before I published, I did wonder if it would be yet another reason to ignite something beyond its intention—particularly on micro.blog. Absolutely, you can read into the post whatever you wish, but its intentions are surface level.

It does not arch back to privilege, nor is it any kind of commentary on political or racial issues. It’s just a blog post about me not publishing because I would rather not start **yet another** discussion on note-taking apps. I would have, were it not so easy for people to reply and make their feelings known directly to me on my blog post comments.

To see it extended to some kind of indicator of deep-rooted entitlement is annoying at best. Whilst I do think it’s important to think about the way your words could be taken, these kinds of issues are why I don’t publish most of my blog posts. I love a constructive discussion on my thoughts and ideas, there is nothing better than having them tested, but this is beyond that.

I would rather not reply. Nor do I want to give it time to think through the ideas posed in response. I think this may be the point that I give up because I can’t be doing with it. If you miss the point, that’s on me too, but reach out to me first, please.

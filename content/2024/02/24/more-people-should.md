James Somers [encouraging more people to write](https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write):

> More people should do what I’m doing right now. They should sit at their computers and bat the cursor around — write full sentences about themselves and the things they care about.

This is an old post, and reminiscent of many newer versions I have linked to but it captures what I experience perfectly. When I am motivated to write, and that doesn’t come easily, the world seems different. As James says about himself — I feel curious about things, with a desire to form thoughts and ideas about myself.

It doesn’t need to be great writing, I mean look at the state of my posts, you just need to do it. Let me know the things you are doing and what you find interesting. Set free your inner weirdness and display your motivations. Just write and the world will be right.

Ava writing about [effort in their newsletter](https://ava.substack.com/p/effort:):

> if someone’s much better than you at something, they probably try much harder. You probably underestimate how much harder they try. I’m not saying that talent isn’t a meaningful differentiator, because it certainly is, but I think people generally underestimate how effort needs to be poured into talent in order to develop it.

Whenever you feel yourself saying "I'd love to be good at that thing" - the answer is go and do it. Sure there is talent at play for getting to the extremes of things, but nothing replaces hard work, effort and dedication.

It doesn't matter what it is, writing, taking photos, getting fit - just go do it and stop wishing.

After more than 40 years (yes, I am old) I am well aware of needing [massive barriers](https://greg-morris.micro.blog/2019/12/17/intentional-barriers.html) in the way of my bad habits. I have very little self-control when it comes to dopamine boosting things, and my phone is the worst.

I realise how pathetic that is. Over the years, I’ve given advice which is regurgitated from that which I receive (often unrequested) multiple times. To simply stop. Much like an addict l, because that is what I am of sorts, I’ve tried too hard too quickly and slowly returned to ‘normal’. 

This is a personality weakness that unfortunately I just can’t overcome. Hence, why I need to babysit myself and treat myself like an idiot. A title that I well deserve because I can’t put the shinny thing with bright flashing colours down and live in the world.

So in steps Screen Time. Yes, that truly pathetic attempt and virtue signalling that Apple introduced with iOS12 six years ago. It’s slow, it uses [unnecessary battery life at times](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/gcrrsy/comment/fpefy1y/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and it’s easy to get around. Let me tell you though — it works.

Typically, the criticism with Screen Time is that it is too easy to bypass. That instead Apple should have built some kind of phone jail to keep people like me out in times of weakness. Instead, I think it strikes the right balance. By putting a simple screen in between me taping the icon and opening the app ensures I think about if I do want to open the app. Something the [popular Opal app](https://www.opal.so/pricing) charges a fortune for. 

It puts just enough friction between me and something that won’t benefit my future self, and still being able to use the app if I need to. I have set downtime for the times I want to switch off and also limits to some apps for each day. Babysitting myself works really well, because my monkey mind just can’t stay away.

Manton Reece [pondering about free trials](https://www.manton.org/2024/12/28/at-the-coffee-shop-this.html) whist at the coffee shop: 

> At the coffee shop this morning I asked the barista to make my latte before I paid for it so I could try it first. Wait, no. Because demos and trials are an important complement to things that need thought and time and money, like a $40 app. But does $5 software need a trial? What about if it’s $1?

In discussions around software, it’s easy to draw comparisons to physical products like coffee, but these analogies often fail to capture the unique nature of digital tools. While I understand the reasoning behind such comparisons, they don’t hold up under scrutiny—particularly when discussing something as nuanced as software trials.

Take coffee, for example. It’s a physical, tangible product. When you order a coffee, you know what you’re getting, even if the quality or flavour varies slightly. You won’t ask for a coffee and end up with something entirely unexpected, like a cup of vinegar. There’s a general understanding of the outcome, and the decision-making process is relatively straightforward.

Software, however, is entirely different. Its value and functionality are often abstract until experienced first-hand. Even with detailed descriptions, videos, and user reviews, it’s nearly impossible to fully grasp what a platform offers without direct interaction. This is especially true for platforms that serve specific use cases or offer unique capabilities that might not be immediately clear to new users.

This is where trials come into their own. A trial provides potential users with a hands-on experience, letting them explore the platform and see how it fits into their workflow. For established platforms like WordPress, Ghost or Todoist, extensive documentation and community resources can complement the trial experience, but for platforms with less widespread adoption, trials are even more critical. They bridge the gap between curiosity and commitment, allowing users to make an informed decision.

Imagine arriving at a software platform’s website with very little information on, which is the case with micro.blog, without a clear understanding of what the service offers, it’s challenging to assess its value. A trial in this context isn’t just helpful—it’s essential. It removes barriers, eliminates guesswork, and allows potential users to discover the platform’s strengths for themselves.

By offering a trial, software platforms create an invitation to explore, reducing friction and encouraging a broader audience to engage. For some services, this approach has proven invaluable in growing a loyal user base and showcasing the platform’s potential in ways that static explanations simply cannot achieve.

The best feeling in my online life is when I have inspiration for a post and I open a fresh sheet in Ulysses. Just then, right before I start typing my garbled English onto the sheet and ruin the whole thing, that is an electric feeling that anything could happen.

Maybe I write a really great post, everyone loves it and I get loads of comments and replies. Writers I love begin posting link posts to it, and this fantastic post is referenced all over the web. Massive publications invite me to write op-ed’s for them and send me big cheques in the post.

Or maybe no one reads it. It gets buried in the constant stream of other blog posts being written. Drowned out by all the noise from influencers and stupid vertical videos of people dancing about. Perhaps it contains a stupid typo and I offend someone, meaning I lose my job and become homeless. My wife leaves me due to the embarrassment of writing ‘form’ instead of ‘from’, and now my kids hate me.

Perhaps I won’t bother. It was a stupid idea in the first place anyway.

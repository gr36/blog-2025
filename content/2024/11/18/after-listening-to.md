After listening to [Hark Fork this week](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/15/podcasts/crypto-congress-hbd-chatgpt-what-social-media-platform-should-i-be-on.html) I logged back in to check out Threads and stopped my profile deletion.

Good lord how does anyone look at that place for more than 2 minute. The level of thirst is completely off the charts.  

Needless to say its set to delete again ðŸ˜‚

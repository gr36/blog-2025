Ali Abdaal in the video [How To Reset Your Dopamine](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l6BoSORXCUg&t=404s&pp=2AGUA5ACAQ%3D%3D):

> nudging your balance away from instant gratification things that just let you experience joy and reward in the present moment more towards slower things that actually can help improve your life in the long term

Not only is the level of your exposure to instantly gratifying things ruining the rest of your life, when you choose to do it is more important than you think.

As I have already written about, [doing hard things](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/08/08/do-hard-things.html) is so critical in your life that it can’t be understated. This is even more critical when you first wake and want to meet the rest of the day with the best approach. You don’t need to get up and run a marathon or smash the gym, but “earning your breakfast” will make a dramatic difference to your waistline and your mental clarity that you will kick yourself you don’t start it earlier in life.

For the last few months I have been waking, sorting my things out and going straight out to walk the dog. This arguably isn’t enough for most people, it's such a small change that I think everyone can do it.

N.b. This video mentions the new trend of [‘rotting’](https://www.health.com/what-is-bed-rotting-trend-7561395) and I am now even more confused with the world than ever.

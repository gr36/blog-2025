Cory Dransfeldt loving the fact that [Social media's broken](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/social-medias-broken-and-thats-awesome):

Like Cory, I have my website (I check in on the social bits of micro.blog sometimes although I wish I could turn it off) I have too many books to read, and I have a nice place to sit and read them.

In spite of of all the really great people I have met online I just [can’t be bothered with the discourse any more](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/11/06/i-honestly-dont.html). There is very little point in me spreading my words anywhere outside my own website (and activitypub things attached) so I don’t bother.

I cant thank the ‘world’s dullest edge lord’ enough for breaking Twitter. For infecting the world with his horribleness in the pursuit of his self indulgent version of free speech. I am forever put off being online because social media is broken, and it’s the best thing for us all.

I have [no BlueSky, No Threads](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/11/07/been-on-a.html), and I’ll have none of whatever else is cool these days. Just me. At Greg Morris do co dot UK, and that, my friends is awesome.

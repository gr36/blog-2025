<p>The Dent in <a href="https://thedent.net/posts/echo-chamber-youre-damn-right">Echo chamber? You’re damn right!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I’m chilling in a coffee shop, writing a blog post about echo chambers, I don’t move to the table next to me to listen closer to the muppets there talking about how children shouldn’t be immunised against deadly viruses because Bob down the pub told them about mind controlling nano bots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A perfect analogy. People act like I have to see all this toxic crap online. Or imply I’m weak because I might get ‘triggered’.</p>
<p>But I just want a nice place to hang out and that shouldn’t be an issue.</p>

Matt Birchler writing about [Math Notes in iPadOS 18](https://birchtree.me/blog/that-feature-is-so-cool-ill-never-use-it-though/):

> …while I can academically understand why they’re so impressive and that some people will get massive use out of them, they aren’t valuable to me, so they don’t move the needle at all in terms of me being able to close up some of the friction points I have with using an iPad for all the things I’d love to do with any iPad.

I’ve missed so much in the last few months, especially around the new iPad and iPadOS features. In my [continued search](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/07/26/need-to-upgrade.html) for a new one, I am going back and reading old reviews. This bit from Matt stuck out for me, and being able to see the usefulness of features to other people is such a transferable skill to have.

There’s a tendency to rubbish anything you don’t immediately see as useful. I once had an interaction on Reddit that thankfully I can't remember it word for word; however, they were claiming that updates to the Sony A7vi to include a screenreader and other accessibility features are pointless. They couldn’t see that other people might make use of features that they didn’t need (and also put on show their ableist attitude). 

This happens with almost everything, we all have a tendency to rubbish features and think we could all do a better job, when the reality is we probably couldn’t. Except when it comes to managing the England football team.

Jason Kratz <a href="https://notebook.jasonkratz.me/photos-should-be-whatever-you-want/" class="u-in-reply-to">replying to</a> my earlier post on <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/07/01/instagram-ruined-all.html">Instagram and photography</a>:

Absolutely, there is nothing wrong with this. Perhaps my point came across wrong. 

I am a street photographer first and foremost and my camera roll is filled with all sorts of random photos. My point was more that people worry to much about getting the right shot than enjoying and capturing the moment. Over posing and worrying about getting the perfect shot to share on Instagram, rather than snapping moments.

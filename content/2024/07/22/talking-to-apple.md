Christopher Lawley got to talk to Jenny Chen and Ty Jordan about iPad note-taking and specifically math notes.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LiAvrlKoEjk?si=XudiI6szj3ysXk2P" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Whilst it is predictably a very reserved, PR focused chat, Chris always manages to demonstrate his excitement for iPad features and does an excellent job of walking through the features with them. The video is worth watching if you’re interested in the iPad or Apple at all, it almost gets me interested in the iPad again… almost.

The first Peter McKinnon [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5fc7KQyXeg) I have watched in a while summed up a very modern photography problem perfectly:

> just go shoot a sunrise for no other reason than to absolutely fucking enjoy it. In the questions of what will you do with the photos? After. Who cares nothing, do absolutely nothing. If anything, it's just one for the books.

It doesnâ€™t have to be a sunrise of course, but just go shoot. Who cares what you get from it, what you do with it. Forget the likes you think you need, the stress of worrying what happened to Instagram and where you are going to post your photos. Just go shoot.

Remember why you picked up the camera in the first place.

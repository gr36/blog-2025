Reysu in the video [How to absorb books like a sponge and read 2x faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O6Ic0bM1GA): 

> One of the most valuable things you can do with your free time is reading books. They not only contain a huge depth of information, but just a single idea in a book has the possibility of changing your life entirely.

I recently found Reysu on YouTube and have enjoyed a lot of the videos on their channel. It is a good mix of technology topics and various bits of life advice—particularly the ones on Notebooks, but that's for another day. I hate the title of this one and wrote about why [reading doesn’t need to be hacked](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2022/04/10/reading-doesnt-need.html), but this statement in the first part of the video stood out to me.

Reading is one of my favorite things to do. I don’t know why, I have a million other things to entertain me, but reading takes me to a different place that nothing else can. There’s fiction to distract me but not leave me hollow like passive media does. There’s non-fiction for me to learn new ideas and improve my life. Whatever it is that I am reading, it contains loads of little bits that all leave their mark and improve me as a person.

Also a special shout out to this genius thumbnail that first got me to watch Reysu’s videos.

> Jack‚Äôs criticism of BlueSky is that they shifted focus to the consumer app instead of building the protocol completely. It is a fair criticism. 

I would agree. The shift from creating an open protocol to ‚Äúhow do we make money‚Äù is messy and at times impossible to understand. 

Jacks point that a protocol should not even need a board speaks volumes.

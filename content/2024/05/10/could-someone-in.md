Could someone in the know point me in the right direction of showing books on micro.blog pages. I am currently using the shortcode to show this year reading goal, but would like to show me.

The only page I can find is [here](https://help.micro.blog/t/books-on-micro-blog/35) so is it a case if building something myself?

On their Bear blog, tiramisu [writes about their family](https://tiramisu.bearblog.dev/cup-runneth/):

> it doesn't matter what he thinks or feels about things like family vacations. He does them because they're things he should do, and moments like that illustrate how differently our brains are wired.

This cuts very close to home for me. I am a father, a husband and everything else first before I am an individual. That's just the way I am. Whenever we do anything it is more important for my kids and my wife to enjoy things than I. Fulfilling my desires comes dead last to everything, and that's ok.

This isn't a sod story. Nor is it an inditement of other people getting things over on me. It is simply the way I want to live my life. I enjoy making them happy, and I am always [here for other people](/2023/02/03/im-here-for.html) before I am there for myself. Doing the things I enjoy, like playing the odd game, writing, or exercising is after everyone else is happy. I think I speak for every man with a family when I say my personal enjoyment starts when the kids are tired and my wife is content doing something else, I can then relax.

This is enjoyment for me, and just one of the things I 'signed up for' when I became a father. I put the whole world first, and I am ok with that.

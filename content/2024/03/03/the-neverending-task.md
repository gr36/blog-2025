Every so often, I end up here, in a place where every task completed is met with a few more added to the end. As the list grows, so does my anxiety about trying to reach the end—an end that is never in sight, let alone becoming any closer. At this point, I try to remind myself of a mantra picked up from Oliver Burkeman: "[There will always be more work](/2023/01/30/there-will-always.html)," but it still gets a bit much sometimes.

You see, most of these books on productivity come from places of privilege. They are authored by people who either control their task lists or, quite often, occupy positions where they are no longer burdened by one. The problem is that most of us, the mere mortals who consume these books, do not sit in this graceful position. We often do not control our never-ending task list and must forever contemplate the idea of getting 'too much done' for fear of being given more.

There are a few golden books out there. Earlier this year, I read [Make Time](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Make_Time/eaFHDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0), which came from a more understanding place. The two authors, although afflicted with the tendency to talk about themselves too much, wrote the book from a more realistic position in working life. I am sure there are more out there too, but the books, podcasts, and YouTube videos all talk about very simple things: scheduling your work (in a myriad of different ways) and being dedicated to completing it.

You can time block. You could plan ahead. Mark one task as [your priority](/2023/01/24/thinking-about-important.html). It doesn't really matter. What none of them talk about, save for "4000 Weeks", is the stress of it all. Looking at your task list and never seeing it get shorter is one of the best motivation killers imaginable. Having no breaks in your workload to think, plan, be creative, or complete a task you find more fulfilling is a passion killer—a surefire way to burn out and throw in the towel.

As I said at the start, there will always be more work, and that's a good thing to keep moving and stay motivated. However, there comes a point when it becomes too much, the plate is piled too high, and there is no room to breathe. Drowning in tasks is a terrible way to go.

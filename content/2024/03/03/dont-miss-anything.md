Cory Dransfeldt writes in a way that feels like it's aimed at me, because [everything is a checklist](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/everything-is-a-checklist/):

> Check, check, check, clear the queue, close the rings, get to zero. I know this looks neurotic; it is neurotic because I'm neurotic. I always have been, or at least as long as I can remember.

My wife and I have joked for a long time about the fact that if an event isn't in our calendar, it doesn't happen. We've built up this rigid structure around hospital appointments and kids' activities, that now is an unwavering bubble of organisation. There are always things to do, events to go to, and people to see â€“ but my life neuroticism goes much deeper than this.

I have no idea where it comes from, but it seems like in life, there is always something to check off the list. Ten thousand steps, five fruits and veggies a day, eight glasses of water. Check, Check, Check. Don't forget the smartphone app to log it all in too! Otherwise, you're not getting the best out of life, and you'll never be successful without these five things in your life. **Just Stop**.

Kyle Hill in their [YouTube video on generative AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrcbH0ge2WE):

> The Internet feels steadily more lifeless. But that's because, like those alien civilisations, the real human users are hiding in private apps, servers, and RSS feeds, lest they be beset by these digital predators. This is Yancey Strickler's dark forest theory of the Internet, something to explain the declining realness of the web.

This tracks with my own usage of 'the web'. A once vibrant, interactive, and at times time-sucking web now feels, well, a bit [boring](/2022/09/06/the-internet-is.html). I won't go as far as saying [people online don't exist](/2021/09/09/what-if-twitter.html); there are people around, really interesting people, but at the same time, it feels a bit stale, sucked of the vibrancy that existed a few years ago.

In his video, Kyle explains Yancey Strickler's [dark forest theory of the Internet](https://onezero.medium.com/beyond-the-dark-forest-a905e2dd8ae0). The notion that the internet is a dark forest, beset with life, life that is thriving as much as it ever was, but doesn't make too much noise for fear of the consequences. We've learned from the years of living online that almost nothing online is real, and responding to what is real isn't worth the consequences.

I won't go into any more detail than that surface-level summary, because the video is well worth a watch, but it played with thoughts about my online life that have been swirling for a while, and I think it might do the same for you.

I am not sure where these private spaces where my internet friends exist now are; perhaps someone could let me know, but they sound like a much better place than living in the dark forest.

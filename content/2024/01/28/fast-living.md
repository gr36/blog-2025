Leo Babauta saying [Become Quiet So You Can Listen](https://zenhabits.net/quietude/):

> …it’s a very human tendency to want to be busy, productive, filling every space with something useful or entertaining.

I’m one of those suckers. Those people who accuse the modern world of always being to blame for everything wrong until proven otherwise. This is one of those posts that makes me think about a small throwaway point and change my view.

Is it a natural human trait to want to be busy with something?

I suffer with a constant restless body to the point that, at times, I have to [force myself](/2022/12/24/my-theme-for.html) to stop and do nothing. Just for a bit. My mind tricks me into believing that if I am not doing something, anything, I am wasting my time. I thought this was because of the modern world, some rub of from hustle culture, but now I am starting to think it is just me.

Long before social media, YouTube productivity gurus and hustle porn, the world was still busy. My mother was endlessly doing something. Working, meeting people, taking part in events. Just never still and present. Perhaps this is where my habit comes from, or maybe it’s just the modern normal?

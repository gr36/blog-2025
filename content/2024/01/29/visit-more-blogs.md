Evan Sheehan in their post <a href="https://darthmall.net/weblog/2023/rss/" class="u-in-reply-to">RSS?</a>:

> I wonder what the alternative looks like. A tool that helps you remember the sites you like to visit so that you can browse them at your leisure, but that doesn’t create a commitment to read—or at least look at—absolutely everything that is published on all of those sites.

At first, this seemed like a crazy idea, but the more I thought about it, the more it made perfect sense. I read 99% of the blogs I follow in my [favourite app Matter](/2022/12/14/matter-my-most.html). Which is great in that it boils websites down to the basic content and makes it easier to read. However, it removes all personality and expression from personal websites.

The idea above is not as crazy as it sounds. Before Facebook invented ‘the feed’ I remember keeping a bookmark list of my friends' pages that I would check in on every so often and it's wonderful when the internet goes full circle. Making the same list of my favourite blogs to check and enjoy the revelry of their website brings life back into the web. 

I just hope it doesn’t fuel my tendency to fiddle with my blog's CSS every five minutes!

Cory Dransfeldt writing about [Data ownership and agency](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/data-ownership-and-agency/): 

> I control that data, it sits on infrastructure I manage, it's in a format I understand and I get the responsibility (or fun â€” let's go with that) of presenting it. I get agency and that agency is accompanied by the burden of maintenance, presentation and action. Convenience in exchange for control.

As usual, Cory's take is measured, accurate, and raises some interesting points on the ownership of your data online. Many people have begun to think about these things now that the USA is finally preparing [legislation on privacy and personal data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/07/congress-privacy-deal-cantwell-rodgers/). Of course, that isn't a worry for me, but this short statement prodded at something I was thinking about when moving my blog around in the last few weeks.

I really want to have an 11ty blog and keep all of my data to myself. I can then pull in whatever it is I want from around the web and display it in whichever way I choose. Thankfully, I am skilled enough to write a bit of code and get things going. It makes the most sense for me, but I just can't be bothered. I want to be able to post easily, post all sorts of things, and not have to worry about a thing - in exchange for that, I give up control.

Don't get me wrong, I trust Manton and micro.blog more than any other platform; this is more control of how I can do things and, in some cases, what I can do. In exchange for being able to post easily and not have to deal with rebuild times and server things - my host calls the shots now. This will range from pretty much unlimited ability on platforms like WordPress to locked-down services like Hey World. Whoever it is you choose, as Cory writes, you get "Convenience in exchange for control".

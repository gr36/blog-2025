There is a tendency for me to not publish many of the photos I take. A high proportion of them end up in the bin, and many others just sit doing nothing in my Lightroom catalogue. I constantly compare the results of my photos to other people that I see online and the conclusion more often than not is that mine or boring and donâ€™t offer anything. With my break away from seeing other peoples work I made the decision to show the boring photos I took the other day just because I can.

A short trip to Nottingham shopping and three images taken.

Comparison is the theft of all joy right.

Following my previous post, where I discussed how [certain tasks seem too easy](/2024/04/06/itâ€™s-too-easy.html), it's equally important to identify opportunities to simplify our lives for the better. When tackling any task, whether mundane or complex, the desire to complete it must surpass the energy required. This includes considering the task's relevance and potential outcomes.

However, this might sound a bit redundant, so let's revisit the two examples from my last post: getting out of bed to perform daily routines and responding to social media posts. Your motivation to leave the comfort of your bed can fluctuate significantly, influenced by various factors such as work obligations, caring for dependents, and maintaining personal routines. These motivations drive us to complete necessary daily tasks with minimal fuss.

Naturally, it's more comfortable to stay in bed, but it's also straightforward to get up and start your day. On an individual level, though the effort required is low and the motivation high, the significance of the outcomes in your life is profound. Neglecting daily responsibilities can lead to immediate and noticeable consequences.

Now, let's consider responding to a social media post. As previously mentioned, this task is overly simple, allowing users to quickly tap a button and share their thoughts with minimal effort. I believe adding complexity to this process, such as requiring a more thoughtful response posted on one's blog, could balance the effort with the desire to engage. While it might not eliminate all frivolous responses, it could significantly reduce them.

The primary motivation behind this post is my experience with blogging. I've made the process more complex than necessary. While Eleventy (11ty) suits my learning style and offers great flexibility, publishing content is not as straightforward as platforms like WordPress or micro.blog. This complexity reduces my posting frequency since I now require significant motivation to write and publish, leading to many potential posts remaining in Apple Notes.

It's disappointing, but perhaps this added complexity is necessary.

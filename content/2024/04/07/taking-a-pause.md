I've realised I need a break from the digital world. Not a complete detachment—after all, avoiding the web entirely is nearly impossible—but I must recalibrate how I'm spending my time online. Since 2019, after moving on from Twitter, I haven't really found my footing. Mastodon, while offering a different platform, often serves as a diversion from engaging with the world directly.

Hence, I've decided to step back for a while. This decision isn't for attention or to make a statement; it's more like setting a milestone for myself, a reminder of this moment in time. I've taken similar pauses before and likely will again. However, I rarely evaluate whether these breaks truly make a difference in my life.

Maybe the pressures of life are just becoming too overwhelming, and a short hiatus will rejuvenate me. Yet, at this moment, I can't foresee a quick return. Instagram remains the only social platform I'm holding onto, despite my desire to leave it behind as well. I haven't found a suitable alternative for sharing my photographs. With plans to capture more everyday moments using my GRiiix, perhaps my blog will become the primary outlet for these expressions.

This feels like a mid-life crisis, as I struggle to understand where I, a 40-year-old, fit into the online world. The answer seems to be "everywhere and nowhere." The connections I made on Twitter in my late 20s haven't been replicated elsewhere, despite my efforts on platforms like micro.blog and Mastodon. Currently, there's a lot I'm unsure about. Yet, one thing remains clear: I will continue to write and share my thoughts on my blog, I hope you follow along.

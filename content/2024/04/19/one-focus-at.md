Over the last few months, it has been challenging to balance my interests and focus. Indeed, I have wasted a lot of time moving things around and messing with my websites, but along with this I have found it difficult to do more than one ‘thing’ at a time. There’s something to be said about putting all your effort one way, but I enjoy lots of different creative things and don’t like neglecting other areas.

Take my blog writing for example. It comes in waves of inspiration and I can post lots of them for a few days straight, perhaps a few weeks if I am lucky, and then it dries up again. This usually co-insides with me doing something else, like developing things for my blog. Or perhaps spending some time taking photos. It appears that my brain cant be creative in more ways than one!

I decided a [break away from social media](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/04/09/phone-boredom.html) was best for me, and along with it came numerous blog posts because it was my only outlet. Since posting more to micro.blog I have [developed](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/04/17/statuslog-microblog-plugin.html) three plugins and so writing stopped almost all together (unless readme files count). This week I went to London and [took plenty of photos](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/04/18/two-of-my.html), so I have no doubt that writing will take a back seat again for a while.

It is as if something triggers in my brain and I can only see things one way for a while. When I am writing, my camera sits there gathering dust. Should I try to develop anything in that time, it often doesn’t go very well, and I have to push through it. The main thing I want to keep doing is posting to my blog, whilst trying to find a way to balance my varied interests, but currently it’s hard.

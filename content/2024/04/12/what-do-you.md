Sure, you can [make the web boring](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/04/09/phone-boredom.html), and it's great for a bit. I experience renewed concentration levels and suddenly gain more inspiration for blog posts. There comes a point when you wonder why you ever use the social web, but it becomes apparent a little later on. There's little point if you get nothing back.

The rather depressing fact is, much of what I do online is because I like interacting with other people. As I wrote about a few days ago, I have [zero friends](2024/04/10/an-examined-life-with-no-friends.html) and rely heavily on platforms to provide this for me. More than this, though, is my love of [getting replies](/2021/06/28/more-comments-and.html). In many ways, the reason I take pictures and write blog posts is for other people's reactions, and not hearing them sucks.

That is not the sole reason, but it's a big part of it. A blog without a way for people to reply easily is a bit of a downer. I could start tracking analytics and worry about page views, etc. Perhaps look at a comments section or reply by email. These are all great ideas, but the easiest thing to do is share the things I do online. Unfortunately, I have begun to realise that Micro.blog may be the best way to achieve this by being able to share once and post to different places.

Doh!

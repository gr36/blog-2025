Charlie Warzel with an [interesting thread](https://www.threads.net/@cwarzel/post/C5Gx6dcx9PU) on Threads:

> the bigger thing is it touches on a gut feeling we all have: so much has changed technologically in a short amt of time! We know this connectivity is working on us, but it's challenging to pin down exactly how. 

This thread was linked by [this week's Platformer](https://www.platformer.news/anxious-generation-jonathan-haidt-debate-critique/) that discusses the recent book by Jonathan Haidt on the links between anxiety and social media. Something I [wrote about in passing](https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/04/09/but-the-algorithm.html) a few days ago because it seems to be the talk of the media industry at the moment. 

Casey Newton [interviewed Haidt on Hardfork](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/podcasts/hard-fork-apple-lawsuit-reddit-ipo.html) a few weeks ago and followed up with some rebuttals the [following episode](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/29/podcasts/ais-messy-moment-listeners-respond-to-jonathan-haidt-shrimp-jesus.html). I thought the interview came across very well, but it’s important to never take those spouting research on podcasts at face value. Science isn’t always as straightforward as it can be presented as, especially when so many are covered in such a little time.

Whoever you listen to regarding the research, Charlie rightly points that we all have this gut feeling that social media isn’t good for us. If you take a break from scrolling, even for a short period of time, you start to feel better. Our brains are simply not made for the sensory overload. It’s just a question of how much and what the effects actually are—something that may never be completely proven.

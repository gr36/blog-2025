People are often interested in the things I use and the setups of my technology. This page serves as an almost constantly changing outline of the stuff I love and the apps and services that help me do things. 

## iPhone 16 Pro Max
I am on my second year of using a Pro Max device and this tine it really pushes the limits. I do like it, but I wish I could do without it. My life is run from this device and a lot of my photos come from it, so it's not all bad.

## Apple Watch Ultra 2022
I wrote a long [love letter to this watch](https://www.gr36.com/2022/11/18/apple-watch-ultra.html) that has surprisingly been my best purchase of the year. I am not really one for using loads of apps on my Apple Watch, but I really love the new explorer watch face that shows signal. It allows me to be phoneless for a lot of my day.

## MacBook Pro 16 inch M3
I use this machine for everything in my personal and creative life. I upgraded this time from the 'entry level' M1 so I now have 36GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. I adore using my Macbook everywhere I go, but it has become more of a work machine than an enjoyable everyday one. 

## IPad Pro M4
My trusty 2018 iPad finally gave up this year so I upgraded to a new version. I use it almost every day for drawing in Illustrator and viewing mock ups for UI designs. I don't think most people need an iPad Pro, but this one is exceptional versatile. 

## AirPods Max & Pro
There is not much of my normal working day that I don’t have headphones in of some description. I use my AirPods Pro for listening to podcasts or audiobooks whilst walking the dog. Replacing them with AirPods Max in the office and playing Brain FM. They help keep my world quiet and my brain focused on the tasks at hand. It's rare that a bit of tech doesn’t distract me and instead helps me get work done.

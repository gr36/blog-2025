Some interesting points made by [@matt@writing.exchange](https://micro.blog/matt@writing.exchange) on [this](https://writing.exchange/@matt/110669921603570518) thread re: Meta and ActivityPub.

> Suddenly Meta can see a much wider social graph for me. They can find any alt accounts. They can recommend those to the people I know on Threads / Instagram / Facebook -- or to complete strangers.

Could this be used to widen their social graph and data colletion on others without their knowledge?

[Nobody cares about your blog.](https://www.alexmolas.com/2023/07/15/nobody-cares-about-your-blog.html)

> I was just about to publish this post, and then I started to think “why should I publish this text? Who is going to waste their time to read this crap?”, but you know what? I just don’t care what you think, here’s my post and you can do nothing about it

You wouldn't think twice about a Thread or a Tweet, so why a blog post. More [personal bloging](https://www.gr36.com/2023/07/26/more-personal-blogging.html) please.

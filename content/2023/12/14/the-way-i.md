When I [first moved to micro.blog](/2018/05/25/youxre-not-cool.html) I had this dream that I would be able to write and publish freely. By removing the worry about what to post where and how it looked *should* have released more posts into the world. No stress from separating what goes on my blog and what goes on social media. By publishing whatever I wanted, however I wanted, I freed myself up to do more. Yet here I am years later, still trying to have a ‚Äòproper blog‚Äô.

I still sit down with an idea, or two, looking to flesh it out and hit a magic 300 word mark where I start to think it might be publishable. Someone put this limit in my head years ago, possibly for SEO on a proper blog, and since then, I have always stuck to it. Titled properly, with an image for the rich link previews. Then and only then could I even *think* about it going live.

When the reality is, none of this matters. The way I, or anyone, formats their blog posts means exactly nothing. In fact, in some weird [Red Sneaker Effect attempts](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270844183_The_Red_Sneakers_Effect_Inferring_Status_and_Competence_from_Signals_of_Nonconformity#:~:text=A%20series%20of%20studies%20demonstrates,for%20uniqueness%20in%20the%20observers.), numerous publications are trying new things and evolving the way posts are structured. Yet here I am, asking ChatGPT to make me an image and worrying about these limits **that I impose on myself**.

I went so far before as hiding away my shorter posts from my home pages, but now show them along with everything else. I will continue to exclude these in the main RSS feed, and I do think that a lot of my ideas need to be developed and fleshed out to see if they even make sense. As [I discussed before,](/2023/12/06/my-words-when.html) I use this process as personal development, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt hit publish.

ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The entirety of this post that I have been talking to myself about publishing more things, I have still been looking at the word counter and making sure it gets up high enough - but I didn't include an image. It's a start.

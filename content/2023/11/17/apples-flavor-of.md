ðŸ”— <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/11/16/apples-flavor-of-rcs-wont-support-googles-end-to-end-encryption-extension" class="u-in-reply-to">Apple's flavor of RCS won't support Google's encryption extension</a>

> According to a report from TechRadar, Apple won't adopt proprietary extensions like the one made by Google that adds end-to-end encryption to RCS. Instead, Apple intends to work with the GSMA to add encryption to the RCS Universal Profile.

RCS is already a fragmented mess.

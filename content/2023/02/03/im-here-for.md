There is a new word I learnt a few weeks ago – compersion. It’s vicarious joy, associated with sexual pleasure ([Louis Theroux taught me it](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/04/altered-states-love-without-limits-review-louis-theroux-treads-his-tightrope) before you ask). It’s used mainly in talk around swinging and polyamorous relationships. However, that’s not what I want to discuss (thank god) but it does relate to what I think my calling in life is.

I struggle to see the point in life. For many years of it I have [been in pain](/2021/03/30/the-thought-of.html) and for a long time have questioned what the end goal is. I'm a creature of habit and strive for structure and routine, but often feel like I’m living in a never-ending cycle looking for the exit route. Endlessly searching for the point in all this, and maybe because I’m getting on a bit I’ve started to look harder.

This has been the topic of my [journaling](/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html) and my notes. I’ve been reading and watching so much about the topic that Google must think I’m having a breakdown. Perhaps I am, but I think I’ve cracked it. I think the whole reason I am here is the vicarious enjoyment I get from improving other people lives. 

I’ve become a little obsessed in leaving a legacy. I won’t be able to leave trust funds or investments, I just want to leave behind memories of a great guy. When I’m gone, I want people to think “he was a great guy that Greg”. That’s it. 

I enjoy other people trusting me enough to come to me for advice. I love going out of my way to help people with chores or issues or anything really. I get my kicks from seeing other people smile. If there is an all powerful creator they 100% put me here to help other people. Sure, I get enjoyment from technology and other stuff, but improving other people’s lives is my drug! 

I think I’m doing a pretty good job, but there’s always more to do. Perhaps now I know myself a bit more, I can go even further.

[A kinder, gentler philosophy of success - Alain de Botton](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success?language=en)

> it's bad enough not getting what you want, but it's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want and find out at the end of the journey that it isn't, in fact, what you wanted all along. - Alain de Botton

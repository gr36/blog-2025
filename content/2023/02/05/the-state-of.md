As a means of follow up to my post in [early 2022](/2022/01/04/subscription-creep.html), I decided to think about my subscriptions yet again. I’d like to say that things are different now, but it seems worse. Every service seems to have changed to a subscription and those that have already seem to be hiking the prices, some by quite a bit!

There have been some adjustments in my usage and also returns of apps I ditched.

## Must Haves
[Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/ "Ulysses") - still my favourite wiring app, don’t see this going anywhere, perhaps ever.

[Adobe](https://www.adobe.com) - Still don’t pay for it technically, still essential. Nothing will ever replace it, but it costs a fortune. Not interested in replacements.

[Brain FM](/2021/12/18/brain-fm-the.html) - Never ever giving this up, gets more work done than any other subscription I pay for.

[Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) - I was experimenting last year, and this year it's my blog. Love this service. 

[Day One](https://dayoneapp.com) - Canceled this last year, but I’ve started [journaling in a big way](/2023/01/29/journaling-and-me.html), and it has quickly become a must-have. 

## Changed
[Apple one](https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-one/) - replaced with the family plan following the price increase. Don’t use News nor Fitness+ so saved £120 a year.

[Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com) - Still acts as my playground a little and hosts [gregmorris.co.uk](https://gregmorris.co.uk), but may ditch this later in the year. 

## Gone
Pocketcasts - Replaced with Overcast, purely to save a bit of money.

Netflix - Very little on that make the cost worth it any more. 

Headspace - Still meditating, but doing it with some Brain FM background noise. The app became a real chore to use and far too busy.

Over the last couple of years I have become really aware of the subscriptions I sign up for and the value they give. I’ve cut around 10 out and saved no end of money. I agree that developers should get the money they deserve but the costs of some really put me off. Glad I did the experiment and cut down my spending.

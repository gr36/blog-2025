Are you ready for the exciting 19th edition of The [Morning News Tournament of Books](https://themorningnews.org/tob/)? Field Notes are once again the title sponsor of this thrilling literary event that takes place each spring. To mark this event, they have released the Rooster Book special edition with cover illustration by [Carson Samson](https://www.instagram.com/carsonsamson_art/).

The Tournament of Books is a Battle Royale competition where the best fiction works from the previous year go head-to-head. It follows a March Madness-style bracket, with books facing off against each other in a series of battles, where one is decided the champion. The winners are determined by an esteemed panel of judges who read and compare the books, revealing their decision and the thought process behind it.

If you intend to grab[ the limited edition](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/rooster-book-2023) Rooster Book, they are available for just $5 and all the profits will go towards 826 National – giving under-resourced 6-18 year olds the chance to elevate their writing skills. Inside you will find 48 pages of ruled paper and a checklist of this year's books.

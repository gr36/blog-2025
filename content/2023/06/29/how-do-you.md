How do you make your life fulfilling, and complete meaningful tasks? 

[Michael Stegar](http://www.michaelfsteger.com) outlines this well with three features
* Coherence - you understand the narrative
* Purpose - it is directed towards a goal you believe in
* Significance - it is important to you or something you believe in

This could be summed up in my own words as
>  A meaningful task is orientated towards a goal that I understand and if accomplished it would have a meaningful impact on something I value

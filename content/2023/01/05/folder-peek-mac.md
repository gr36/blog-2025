<p>Another little app that I discovered to <a href="/2023/01/04/two-new-mac.html">aid my Mac life</a> recently is <em>another</em> free one. I discovered this one through a post by fellow micro.blogger <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://heydingus.net/blog/2022/12/folder-peek-app">Jarrod Blundy</a>, and it has become a staple of my Mac usage ever since.</p>

<p>Do you ever have to go digging around in finder to head to the same usual folders time after time? Me to. We have a Dropbox shared archive at work that drives me insane with the amount of level changes I need. Sure, I could set up a load of messy aliases or dock folders, but this apps solves all of that. Placing a nice and neat icon in my menu bar and storing all the folders I require.</p>

<p>I can also navigate around with ease to other destinations, see a preview of the file, or open the file I require without leaving my desktop. There are so many delightful little touches that it's hard to point out them all. My favourites are right-clicking on the icon opens the folder in finder, and that I can set a few different folders to all be accessible from one menu bar icon. Although it is starting to look a bit full now!</p>

<p>I am so impressed with this app I’m also testing a few other ones by the same developer <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/apps">Sindre Sorhus</a> as they all seem very high quality. I have already installed, <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/today">Today</a> to put my calendar in my menu bar (menu bar all the things) and also <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/actions">Actions</a> to extend Shortcuts abilities. I have a feeling that I might be going all out on customising my Mac currently so I hope you don’t mind me sharing what I find along the way.</p>

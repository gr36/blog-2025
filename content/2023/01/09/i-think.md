I often forget to put these two tiny words into my sentences. When I make [link posts](/categories/links/) or try to make a point, it’s easy to get carried away and state your opinion as fact. When all we are really doing it publishing what we think.

There’s typically not many definitive answers to the things I tend to write about. It’s all ephemeral thoughts, feelings, educated guesses. There might be some research conducted here and there about the topics, but frequently the conclusions to those have more questions than answers.

There’s nothing wrong with giving our opinions on things, it’s the whole point, really. Blogging about topics and ideas that we have that might be right. Yet, I forget to put in those tiny words a lot of the time. I think a lot about the topics I write about, I just don’t write about thinking. I write about knowing.

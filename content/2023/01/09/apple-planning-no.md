[Apple Planning No Major Updates For AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, or Apple TV in 2023](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/08/airpods-apple-watch-ipad-apple-tv-2023/)

I can’t speak to the Apple TV but all of the other products have reached a maturity level where updates would be hard. 

We don’t need an update every year anyway.

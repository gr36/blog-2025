After having no end of problems with [Matter](https://www.gr36.com/2022/12/14/matter-my-most.html) recently with content not showing and loads of newsletter issues I’m exploring options.

I like Readwise reader but its too fiddly to use. The web app especially is really confusing to navigate and I can’t quite put my finger on why.

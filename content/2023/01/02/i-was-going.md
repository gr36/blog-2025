I really was. Despite not feeling very well, and not due to New Year's Eve for once, I wanted to publish something today. Not because I had much to say, but because I am on a bit of a roll lately and have found that the act of wanting to write something usually pushes something into my mind. 

This is in stark contrast to my thoughts a few months ago, where I chose to keep quiet unless I had [something to say](/2021/11/19/something-to-say.html). However, I have found that my motivation needs a bit of a prod even now and again. Taking some advice from James Clear in [Atomic Habits](https://micro.blog/books/9780735211292) (<a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://chrishannah.me/success-is-a-lagging-indicator/">via Chris Hannah</a>) sometimes I have to want to be a writer and take on a writer's identity to actually do some writing.

![](https://greg-morris.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bbfc93e351.jpg)

Instead, I just fixed loads of bugs in my blog, wrote an [about me page](/about/me/) and played around with my writing environment. I’ve been a long-time user of Ulysses and have been feeling the itch to move to something new. Doing the usual thing of [downloading every app going](/2021/03/19/looking-for-my.html), realising that Ulysses is the best one for me again, and instead messing with my theme to make it look new. A new lick of paint seems to have done the trick for now at least. 

Hence, this post started out as a test to see whether I liked the new theme or not. So in a round about way I did what I set to do, just not in the way a ‘proper writer’ should do. Or maybe they do, fart about and do other things until inspiration hits them? I have no idea, but getting things done in your own way doesn’t really matter as long as the thing gets done — and I had fun doing it.

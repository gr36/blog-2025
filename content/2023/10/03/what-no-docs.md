At the end of Robert Rackley brief [overview of Matter adding podcasts](https://canneddragons.net/matter-podcasts-integration/):

> The FAQs for Matter’s new podcast feature are contained in a tweet (or whatever you call posts on X). What happened to actual product documentation? It’s not uncommon these days for software to gain features with little to no documentation that actually explains how to use them.

I was always shocked when companies chose to host their product documents on Medium instead of their website, but this is a new low. 

Having your guides and tutorials on a social media platform is bonkers. What happens when Elon decides you are. To log in to view. Or rate limits views. Or just deleted it ‘[accidentally](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/20/23838823/twitter-x-deleted-pictures-links-2014-metadata-t-co-shortener)’. 

The manual on how to use your product, and how you communicate this to your users, should be as valuable as the product itself.

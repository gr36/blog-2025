[Other People's Enthusiasm](https://baty.net/posts/2023/10/other-people-s-enthusiasm)

> When someone writes enthusiastically about something, I want to try that thing. It could be software, a camera, a process, or a habit.

I don’t think I am alone in knowing this feeling in depth. It doesn’t take much enthusiasm for it to rub off and push me down a rabbit hole. 

To be clear, it 100% *is* FOMO.

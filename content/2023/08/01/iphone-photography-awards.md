[iPhone Photography Awards](https://daily.baty.net/posts/2023/07/31/iPhone-Photography-Award.html)

> I love that people are doing such wonderful work using iPhones, but I'll keep my nice cameras that I enjoy using to make mediocre snapshots, thanks.

I agree with [@jack](https://micro.blog/jack). I take a lot of [photos](https://www.gr36.com/photos/) on my phone because it is usually the best camera i have with me. However, *for me* photography is more about the process of taking the images and the things it says to me than the perfect outcome.

The fact that phone cameras can take such amazing pictures now is brilliant, but the standard experience, at least on the iPhone, needs work.

We went to meet another family with a child that has the same genetic condition as Lucie today. MEF2C haploinsufficiency syndrome is [extremely rare](https://www.rarechromo.org/media/information/Chromosome%20%205/MEF2C%20haploinsufficiency%20syndrome%20QFN.pdf), possibly as few as 50 people are known, and to have someone just down the road from us is amazing.

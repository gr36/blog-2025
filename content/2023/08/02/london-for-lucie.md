I am no stranger to writing about my life. My [son](/2022/07/17/ninja-warrior.html) and [daughter](/2022/08/30/the-world-is.html) often feature in blog posts, and sometimes podcasts! We have lots of struggles and I use my blog both an outlet and also a way to publicise this. One of our biggest struggles is with Lucie’s [various disabilities](/2020/01/31/the-diagnosis-relief.html) but in particular her Epilepsy.

I also love raising money for charity through various crazy things, such as running [4 miles every 4 hours for 48hours!](/2021/03/09/i-did-it.html) So this week two things in my life collided, and I entered the London Marathon to raise money for a charity very close to my heart, the [Epilepsy Society](https://epilepsysociety.org.uk/).

Epilepsy stops Lucie from doing so many things in here life that it’s at times upsetting. She suffers daily seizures, and we’ve been through numerous investigations and tests to try to get to the bottom of them. All of which are really hard for Lucie to deal with, but she does it all with a smile on her face.

The way she deals with everything and still manages to light up so many people’s lives made it an easy decision to take on this challenge. I have been trying and failing to enter the London Marathon for years, but that doesn’t change the fact that it will be a huge challenge for me. It will cost me months of training and a lot of pain, so I’m asking for a favour in return as a reader and a friend.

<h2>Donate To London For Lucie</h2></a></div>

I’ve set myself an ambitions target of £3000, and I need your help. I know times are rough and the cost of living is higher than ever, but if you can so spare just a couple of £/$/€ I will be forever grateful. If you enjoy my writing, posting, podcast, whatever it may be (and even if you don't), [please donate](https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024) whatever amount you can to make a difference in people's lives.

I am sure he will forgive me, but I always read [thingsThisWeek](https://maique.eu/2023/08/28/thingsthisweek.html) by Maique and like the idea of small updates of the things I have been up to. So without further fuss, hereâ€™s mine. 

This week was ups and downs as usual. Filled full of some working and some days off due to bank holidays and skilfully timed annual leave. I spent a lot of it trying to relax, failing, and also trying to [run a little more](/2023/08/19/trying-to-get.html).

* Yesterday we went to meet another little girl with the same genetic condition as Lucie. Itâ€™s wonderful to think that something so rare, about 50 people have it worldwide, can affect two little girls just down the road from each other.
* I have been a bit slack on some of my important routines over the summer holidays. For example, journalling and meditating. I discovered I can [track habits in Todoist](https://todoist.com/integrations/apps/habit-tracker) so set this up for a few essential ones with reminders. It is working well.
* On the Todoist front, I have been leaning on more digital tools recently. I wrote about my [summer issues with carrying a notebook](/2023/08/26/notebooks-in-summer.html), but even with digital tools I have tried to bring over good analogue habits.
* This week, I have spent some time thinking about what I want my blog to be and working on some theme updates. With this in mind, I have set up [tinylytics](https://tinylytics.app/), the excellent service from [Vincent](https://vincentritter.com/?ts=gr36), just for the â€˜likeâ€™ button. You will notice an improved comment and reply section below.
* My running is going slightly better this week than last. Iâ€™ve been slowly plodding around some miles. I still feel like I might have to give up at any moment, but the great charity I am doing it for keeps me going. Iâ€™d love it if you would donate [here](https://www.justgiving.com/page/greg-morris-lm2024). 
* Had to take a bit of a break from all social media after American politics reared its ugly head again. It seems to have calmed down a bit again, so Iâ€™m checking in every so often â€“ but mostly publishing without visiting anything.
* Iâ€™ve got plenty of thoughts about my [use of a flip hone again](/2023/08/23/my-big-flip.html). I need to get around to writing these up, but every time I try it becomes really preachy, and I would rather not publish that. Safe to say my mind feels a bit better, but I have relented and wearing my Apple Watch again. Iâ€™m not certain how, but it still gives me Todoist notifications and the like, but itâ€™s mainly for tracking runs.

I hope you all have a great week this week, and you know where I am if you need me. ðŸ¤™

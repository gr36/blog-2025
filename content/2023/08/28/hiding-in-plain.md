[hiding in plain sight](https://tiramisu.bearblog.dev/hiding-in-plain-sight/)

> Most of my close friends (and even my parents) know about my blog, but hardly any of them read it and that's the way I like it. If I knew all of them read every single post I would feel less free to write my thoughts here. But I'm quite content to keep hiding in plain sight.

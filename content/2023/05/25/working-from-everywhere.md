Ever since the pandemic hit in early 2020, I've mostly been enjoying the comfort of working from home. Of course, there have been a few weeks here and there when I had other commitments that required me to be elsewhere. But at least 3 out of 5 days, you can find me tucked away in my cozy spare bedroom, diligently working away. Working from home has brought me incredible benefits like improved focus, work-life balance, and so much more. However, as my professional journey progresses, I find myself having to spread my time between home and office life, and it can be a little annoying.

Don't get me wrong, my job itself isn't the annoying part. It's the fact that I have the opportunity to tap into the benefits of both working situations, but figuring out how to make the most of it can be a bit of a challenge. Let's face it, working from home (WFH) is an absolute game-changer for many of us â€” I'm a huge fan. It allows me to work longer, deeper and better without the distractions of a traditional office setting. But, there's no denying the wonderful perks of being around other people.

I have begun to appreciate the value of bouncing ideas off my colleagues, engaging in vibrant conversations, and simply having that positive energy that comes from working side by side with others. That's why most days, you'll find me popping into the office for a quick meeting or a planning session before heading back home. Lucky for me, my office is only a couple of miles away from home, but it's still a tad inconvenient.

I have a desk at work and another one at home, which means I'm stuck with two keyboards, two monitors, and all the other gadgets I'd rather not drag around. It also means that neither place feels like the perfect fit for me. While I do enjoy some of the advantages of both working environments to a certain extent, it's as if I'm constantly on the go, working from different spots all the time. Maybe the solution lies in finding a balance by splitting my time and establishing clear boundaries. Honestly, I have no idea how flexible workers manage it, but I'm open to suggestions!

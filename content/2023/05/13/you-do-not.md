Slight mislead here, you do need apps, but you don’t need a ton of them. Every single post I see will tell you they use this app and that service, which is great — but that is unique to them. That doesn’t mean *you* need to start spending money. 

In most situations, you will be perfectly fine with the stock options you have available. The only time to start looking at other options is *if* you start to hit issues. My best advice is to continually try to work around this first. Shortcuts is a wonderful stock app that I use to implement ‘new’ features into apps.

I am as guilty of this app arrival fallacy as anyone. I convince myself that I just require this new thing, and then I’ll be super productive — but I don’t. The truth is that is often hard to accept is that a new app absolutely will not make you more productive. Sure, fancy services look nice, the marketing makes you think you can get a load more done, but the real answer is to work smarter. 

You will be more productive by having a good system in place, not having a fancy app. I will say it again for those not paying attention, a [new app will not make you more productive](/2019/07/29/a-new-productivity.html).

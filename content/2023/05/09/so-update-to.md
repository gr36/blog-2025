So, update to my [post yesterday](https://www.gr36.com/2023/05/08/i-might-regret.html) about mechanical keyboards.

I bought a [Keychron K3](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k3-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) because it was cheap and approachable. I like the click, I like the feel but the keys are at a weird angle. So I am not sold yet.

I think I might end up just sticking with a Apple Magic keyboard

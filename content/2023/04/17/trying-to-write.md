I think I get it now. I've been asked for years how I manage to write a lot, and I just shrug and think it's not so hard. Even though my blogging does come and go I manage to have plenty of ideas and publish posts, but not at the moment.

At the minute I feel as if I am blocked from ideas. I feel as if [inspiration](/2023/04/08/inspiration.html) doesn't like me, or my brain is  now broken. I've tried to push through this a few times, just [sit in the chair](/2020/08/17/sitting-in-the.html) and write something but I end up messing around on social media. Frustrating as it is, at least I don't *have* to post - I just enjoy when I do.

I will just keep posting things I find and making short posts waiting for something to strike. For an idea that lasts long enough for post to be written or my motivation improves.

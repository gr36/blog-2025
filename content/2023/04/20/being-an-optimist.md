Without going back and checking where, I am sure I have referred to my wife description of me. No, not that one. This might come of a bit of a shock to someone that follow me online, given my disposition to moan about lots of things â€” she calls me "annoyingly positive". To her, I am that guy that looks at everything one way and sees where we can move forward from it.

This stems from a childhood that I wont go into, but I have always had an ability to see the way forward, try to lean into the positive aspects of everything and "just keep swimming" as [Dory would say](https://youtu.be/E-ZF5r1F7nY?t=42). Plus I'm an introvert and hate complaining anyway!

What this doesn't mean is I am not naive in thinking the down times don't exist. I can still 'sit in the mud' as Simon Sink would call it, but more I realise that this too shall pass. Optimism is about being hopeful and positive about the future, that bad things *will* happen, and it's ok to have struggles and issues with them, but there are always better times coming. You may feel like you are in a dark tunnel at the moment, but optimism keeps me working towards the light and everything will be ok.
